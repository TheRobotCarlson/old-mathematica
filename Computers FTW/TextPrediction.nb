         " BOOK I Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate, And haughty \
Juno's unrelenting hate, Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore. Long \
labors, both by sea and land, he bore, And in the doubtful war, before he won \
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town; His banish'd gods restor'd to \
rites divine, And settled sure succession in his line, From whence the race \
of Alban fathers come, And the long glories of majestic Rome. O Muse! the \
causes and the crimes relate; What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate; \
For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began To persecute so brave, so just a \
man; Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares, Expos'd to wants, and \
hurried into wars! Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show, Or exercise \
their spite in human woe? Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away, An ancient \
town was seated on the sea; A Tyrian colony; the people made Stout for the \
war, and studious of their trade: Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more \
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore. Here stood her chariot; here, if \
Heav'n were kind, The seat of awful empire she design'd. Yet she had heard an \
ancient rumor fly, (Long cited by the people of the sky,) That times to come \
should see the Trojan race Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface; Nor thus \
confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway Should on the necks of all the nations \
lay. She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate; Nor could forget the war \
she wag'd of late For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state. Besides, \
long causes working in her mind, And secret seeds of envy, lay behind; Deep \
graven in her heart the doom remain'd Of partial Paris, and her form \
disdain'd; The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed, Electra's glories, and her \
injur'd bed. Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd To kindle vengeance in \
her haughty mind. For this, far distant from the Latian coast She drove the \
remnants of the Trojan host; And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train \
Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main. Such time, such toil, \
requir'd the Roman name, Such length of labor for so vast a frame. Now scarce \
the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars, Had left behind the fair Sicilian \
shores, Ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign, And plowing frothy \
furrows in the main; When, lab'ring still with endless discontent, The Queen \
of Heav'n did thus her fury vent: \"Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?\" \
said she, \"And must the Trojans reign in Italy? So Fate will have it, and \
Jove adds his force; Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course. Could angry \
Pallas, with revengeful spleen, The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men? \
She, for the fault of one offending foe, The bolts of Jove himself presum'd \
to throw: With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship, And bare expos'd \
the bosom of the deep; Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game, The \
wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame, She strongly seiz'd, and with a \
burning wound Transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound. But I, who walk in \
awful state above, The majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove, For length \
of years my fruitless force employ Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy! \
What nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray, Or off'rings on my slighted \
altars lay?\" Thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught. The restless \
regions of the storms she sought, Where, in a spacious cave of living stone, \
The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne, With pow'r imperial curbs the \
struggling winds, And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds. This way and \
that th' impatient captives tend, And, pressing for release, the mountains \
rend. High in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands, And shakes his scepter, \
and their rage commands; Which did he not, their unresisted sway Would sweep \
the world before them in their way; Earth, air, and seas thro' empty space \
would roll, And heav'n would fly before the driving soul. In fear of this, \
the Father of the Gods Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes, And lock'd \
'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads; Impos'd a king, with \
arbitrary sway, To loose their fetters, or their force allay. To whom the \
suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd, And thus the tenor of her suit \
express'd: \"O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n The pow'r of tempests \
and of winds has giv'n; Thy force alone their fury can restrain, And smooth \
the waves, or swell the troubled main- A race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd \
by me, With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea; To fruitful Italy their \
course they steer, And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there. \
Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies; Sink or disperse my fatal \
enemies. Twice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main, Around my person \
wait, and bear my train: Succeed my wish, and second my design; The fairest, \
Deiopeia, shall be thine, And make thee father of a happy line.\" To this the \
god: \"'T is yours, O queen, to will The work which duty binds me to fulfil. \
These airy kingdoms, and this wide command, Are all the presents of your \
bounteous hand: Yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest, I sit with \
gods at their celestial feast; Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue; \
Dispose of empire, which I hold from you.\" He said, and hurl'd against the \
mountain side His quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied. The raging winds \
rush thro' the hollow wound, And dance aloft in air, and skim along the \
ground; Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep, Raise liquid mountains, \
and disclose the deep. South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar, And \
roll the foaming billows to the shore. The cables crack; the sailors' fearful \
cries Ascend; and sable night involves the skies; And heav'n itself is \
ravish'd from their eyes. Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue; Then \
flashing fires the transient light renew; The face of things a frightful \
image bears, And present death in various forms appears. Struck with unusual \
fright, the Trojan chief, With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief; And, \
\"Thrice and four times happy those,\" he cried, \"That under Ilian walls \
before their parents died! Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train! Why could \
not I by that strong arm be slain, And lie by noble Hector on the plain, Or \
great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields Where Simois rolls the bodies and the \
shields Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear The dart aloft, and \
clench the pointed spear!\" Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails, \
Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails, And rent the sheets; the raging \
billows rise, And mount the tossing vessels to the skies: Nor can the \
shiv'ring oars sustain the blow; The galley gives her side, and turns her \
prow; While those astern, descending down the steep, Thro' gaping waves \
behold the boiling deep. Three ships were hurried by the southern blast, And \
on the secret shelves with fury cast. Those hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors \
knew: They call'd them Altars, when they rose in view, And show'd their \
spacious backs above the flood. Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood, \
Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand, And in mid ocean left them moor'd \
aland. Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew, (A horrid sight!) ev'n in \
the hero's view, From stem to stern by waves was overborne: The trembling \
pilot, from his rudder torn, Was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was \
toss'd, Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost; And here and there \
above the waves were seen Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men. \
The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way, And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks \
the rushing sea. Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old, Achates faithful, Abas \
young and bold, Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams, Admit the \
deluge of the briny streams. Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound Of \
raging billows breaking on the ground. Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry \
reign, He rear'd his awful head above the main, Serene in majesty; then \
roll'd his eyes Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies. He saw the \
Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd, By stormy winds and wintry heav'n \
oppress'd. Full well the god his sister's envy knew, And what her aims and \
what her arts pursue. He summon'd Eurus and the western blast, And first an \
angry glance on both he cast; Then thus rebuk'd: \"Audacious winds! from \
whence This bold attempt, this rebel insolence? Is it for you to ravage seas \
and land, Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command? To raise such mountains on the \
troubled main? Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain; And then \
you shall be taught obedience to my reign. Hence! to your lord my royal \
mandate bear- The realms of ocean and the fields of air Are mine, not his. By \
fatal lot to me The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea. His pow'r to \
hollow caverns is confin'd: There let him reign, the jailer of the wind, With \
hoarse commands his breathing subjects call, And boast and bluster in his \
empty hall.\" He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea, Dispell'd \
the darkness, and restor'd the day. Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train \
Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main, Clear from the rocks the \
vessels with their hands: The god himself with ready trident stands, And opes \
the deep, and spreads the moving sands; Then heaves them off the shoals. \
Where'er he guides His finny coursers and in triumph rides, The waves \
unruffle and the sea subsides. As, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd, \
Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud; And stones and brands in \
rattling volleys fly, And all the rustic arms that fury can supply: If then \
some grave and pious man appear, They hush their noise, and lend a list'ning \
ear; He soothes with sober words their angry mood, And quenches their innate \
desire of blood: So, when the Father of the Flood appears, And o'er the seas \
his sov'reign trident rears, Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains, \
High on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins, Majestic moves along, and \
awful peace maintains. The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars To nearest \
land, and make the Libyan shores. Within a long recess there lies a bay: An \
island shades it from the rolling sea, And forms a port secure for ships to \
ride; Broke by the jutting land, on either side, In double streams the briny \
waters glide. Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene Appears above, and \
groves for ever green: A grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats, To rest \
the Nereids, and exclude the heats. Down thro' the crannies of the living \
walls The crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls: No haulsers need to \
bind the vessels here, Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear. Sev'n \
ships within this happy harbor meet, The thin remainders of the scatter'd \
fleet. The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes, Leap on the welcome \
land, and seek their wish'd repose. First, good Achates, with repeated \
strokes Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes: Short flame succeeds; \
a bed of wither'd leaves The dying sparkles in their fall receives: Caught \
into life, in fiery fumes they rise, And, fed with stronger food, invade the \
skies. The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around The cheerful blaze, or lie \
along the ground: Some dry their corn, infected with the brine, Then grind \
with marbles, and prepare to dine. Aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow, \
And takes a prospect of the seas below, If Capys thence, or Antheus he could \
spy, Or see the streamers of Caicus fly. No vessels were in view; but, on the \
plain, Three beamy stags command a lordly train Of branching heads: the more \
ignoble throng Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along. He stood; \
and, while secure they fed below, He took the quiver and the trusty bow \
Achates us'd to bear: the leaders first He laid along, and then the vulgar \
pierc'd; Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain Sev'n mighty bodies with \
their blood distain. For the sev'n ships he made an equal share, And to the \
port return'd, triumphant from the war. The jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' \
gift, When his Trinacrian shores the navy left) He set abroach, and for the \
feast prepar'd, In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd. Thus while he \
dealt it round, the pious chief With cheerful words allay'd the common grief: \
\"Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose To future good our past and \
present woes. With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried; Th' inhuman \
Cyclops and his den defied. What greater ills hereafter can you bear? Resume \
your courage and dismiss your care, An hour will come, with pleasure to \
relate Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate. Thro' various hazards and \
events, we move To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove. Call'd to the \
seat (the promise of the skies) Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise, \
Endure the hardships of your present state; Live, and reserve yourselves for \
better fate.\" These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart; His \
outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart. The jolly crew, unmindful of the \
past, The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste. Some strip the skin; \
some portion out the spoil; The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil; \
Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil. Stretch'd on the grassy turf, at \
ease they dine, Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with \
wine. Their hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends The doubtful fortune of \
their absent friends: Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess, Whether \
to deem 'em dead, or in distress. Above the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate Of \
brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus. The \
day, but not their sorrows, ended thus. When, from aloft, almighty Jove \
surveys Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas, At length on Libyan \
realms he fix'd his eyes- Whom, pond'ring thus on human miseries, When Venus \
saw, she with a lowly look, Not free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke: \
\"O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand Disperses thunder on the seas and \
land, Disposing all with absolute command; How could my pious son thy pow'r \
incense? Or what, alas! is vanish'd Troy's offense? Our hope of Italy not \
only lost, On various seas by various tempests toss'd, But shut from ev'ry \
shore, and barr'd from ev'ry coast. You promis'd once, a progeny divine Of \
Romans, rising from the Trojan line, In after times should hold the world in \
awe, And to the land and ocean give the law. How is your doom revers'd, which \
eas'd my care When Troy was ruin'd in that cruel war? Then fates to fates I \
could oppose; but now, When Fortune still pursues her former blow, What can I \
hope? What worse can still succeed? What end of labors has your will decreed? \
Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts, Could pass secure, and pierce th' \
Illyrian coasts, Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves And thro' nine \
channels disembogues his waves. At length he founded Padua's happy seat, And \
gave his Trojans a secure retreat; There fix'd their arms, and there renew'd \
their name, And there in quiet rules, and crown'd with fame. But we, \
descended from your sacred line, Entitled to your heav'n and rites divine, \
Are banish'd earth; and, for the wrath of one, Remov'd from Latium and the \
promis'd throne. Are these our scepters? these our due rewards? And is it \
thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?\" To whom the Father of th' \
immortal race, Smiling with that serene indulgent face, With which he drives \
the clouds and clears the skies, First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies: \
\"Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire The fates of thine are fix'd, \
and stand entire. Thou shalt behold thy wish'd Lavinian walls; And, ripe for \
heav'n, when fate Aeneas calls, Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me: \
No councils have revers'd my firm decree. And, lest new fears disturb thy \
happy state, Know, I have search'd the mystic rolls of Fate: Thy son (nor is \
th' appointed season far) In Italy shall wage successful war, Shall tame \
fierce nations in the bloody field, And sov'reign laws impose, and cities \
build, Till, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun Thrice thro' the signs his \
annual race shall run: This is his time prefix'd. Ascanius then, Now call'd \
Iulus, shall begin his reign. He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear, \
Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer, And, with hard labor, Alba Longa \
build. The throne with his succession shall be fill'd Three hundred circuits \
more: then shall be seen Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen, Who, full of \
Mars, in time, with kindly throes, Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose. \
The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain: Then Romulus his grandsire's throne \
shall gain, Of martial tow'rs the founder shall become, The people Romans \
call, the city Rome. To them no bounds of empire I assign, Nor term of years \
to their immortal line. Ev'n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils, Earth, \
seas, and heav'n, and Jove himself turmoils; At length aton'd, her friendly \
pow'r shall join, To cherish and advance the Trojan line. The subject world \
shall Rome's dominion own, And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the \
gown. An age is ripening in revolving fate When Troy shall overturn the \
Grecian state, And sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call, To crush the \
people that conspir'd her fall. Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise, \
Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies Alone shall bound; whom, fraught \
with eastern spoils, Our heav'n, the just reward of human toils, Securely \
shall repay with rites divine; And incense shall ascend before his sacred \
shrine. Then dire debate and impious war shall cease, And the stern age be \
soften'd into peace: Then banish'd Faith shall once again return, And Vestal \
fires in hallow'd temples burn; And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain The \
righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain. Janus himself before his fane \
shall wait, And keep the dreadful issues of his gate, With bolts and iron \
bars: within remains Imprison'd Fury, bound in brazen chains; High on a \
trophy rais'd, of useless arms, He sits, and threats the world with vain \
alarms.\" He said, and sent Cyllenius with command To free the ports, and ope \
the Punic land To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate, The queen might \
force them from her town and state. Down from the steep of heav'n Cyllenius \
flies, And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies. Soon on the Libyan \
shore descends the god, Performs his message, and displays his rod: The surly \
murmurs of the people cease; And, as the fates requir'd, they give the peace: \
The queen herself suspends the rigid laws, The Trojans pities, and protects \
their cause. Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies: Care seiz'd his soul, \
and sleep forsook his eyes. But, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day, He \
rose, the coast and country to survey, Anxious and eager to discover more. It \
look'd a wild uncultivated shore; But, whether humankind, or beasts alone \
Possess'd the new-found region, was unknown. Beneath a ledge of rocks his \
fleet he hides: Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides; The bending \
brow above a safe retreat provides. Arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves \
his friends, And true Achates on his steps attends. Lo! in the deep recesses \
of the wood, Before his eyes his goddess mother stood: A huntress in her \
habit and her mien; Her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen. Bare were \
her knees, and knots her garments bind; Loose was her hair, and wanton'd in \
the wind; Her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind. She seem'd a \
virgin of the Spartan blood: With such array Harpalyce bestrode Her Thracian \
courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood. \"Ho, strangers! have you lately \
seen,\" she said, \"One of my sisters, like myself array'd, Who cross'd the \
lawn, or in the forest stray'd? A painted quiver at her back she bore; Varied \
with spots, a lynx's hide she wore; And at full cry pursued the tusky boar.\" \
Thus Venus: thus her son replied again: \"None of your sisters have we heard \
or seen, O virgin! or what other name you bear Above that style- O more than \
mortal fair! Your voice and mien celestial birth betray! If, as you seem, the \
sister of the day, Or one at least of chaste Diana's train, Let not an humble \
suppliant sue in vain; But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd, What \
earth we tread, and who commands the coast? Then on your name shall wretched \
mortals call, And offer'd victims at your altars fall.\" \"I dare not,\" she \
replied, \"assume the name Of goddess, or celestial honors claim: For Tyrian \
virgins bows and quivers bear, And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear. \
Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are- A people rude in peace, and \
rough in war. The rising city, which from far you see, Is Carthage, and a \
Tyrian colony. Phoenician Dido rules the growing state, Who fled from Tyre, \
to shun her brother's hate. Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; \
Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known For wealth, and brother to the \
Punic throne, Possess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart At once was wounded \
with an equal dart. Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid; Pygmalion then \
the Tyrian scepter sway'd: One who condemn'd divine and human laws. Then \
strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. The monarch, blinded with desire of \
wealth, With steel invades his brother's life by stealth; Before the sacred \
altar made him bleed, And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed. Some tale, \
some new pretense, he daily coin'd, To soothe his sister, and delude her \
mind. At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears Of her unhappy lord: the \
specter stares, And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. The cruel \
altars and his fate he tells, And the dire secret of his house reveals, Then \
warns the widow, with her household gods, To seek a refuge in remote abodes. \
Last, to support her in so long a way, He shows her where his hidden treasure \
lay. Admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright, The queen provides \
companions of her flight: They meet, and all combine to leave the state, Who \
hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate. They seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd \
they find; Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind. The vessels, heavy laden, \
put to sea With prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way. I know not, if by \
stress of weather driv'n, Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n; At \
last they landed, where from far your eyes May view the turrets of new \
Carthage rise; There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa call'd, From the \
bull's hide) they first inclos'd, and wall'd. But whence are you? what \
country claims your birth? What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?\" \
To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes, And deeply sighing, thus her \
son replies: \"Could you with patience hear, or I relate, O nymph, the \
tedious annals of our fate! Thro' such a train of woes if I should run, The \
day would sooner than the tale be done! From ancient Troy, by force expell'd, \
we came- If you by chance have heard the Trojan name. On various seas by \
various tempests toss'd, At length we landed on your Libyan coast. The good \
Aeneas am I call'd- a name, While Fortune favor'd, not unknown to fame. My \
household gods, companions of my woes, With pious care I rescued from our \
foes. To fruitful Italy my course was bent; And from the King of Heav'n is my \
descent. With twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea; Fate and my mother \
goddess led my way. Scarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet, From \
storms preserv'd, within your harbor meet. Myself distress'd, an exile, and \
unknown, Debarr'd from Europe, and from Asia thrown, In Libyan desarts wander \
thus alone.\" His tender parent could no longer bear; But, interposing, \
sought to soothe his care. \"Whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by Heav'n, Since \
on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n- Have courage: to the gods permit \
the rest, And to the queen expose your just request. Now take this earnest of \
success, for more: Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore; The winds \
are chang'd, your friends from danger free; Or I renounce my skill in augury. \
Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move, And stoop with closing pinions \
from above; Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along, And thro' the clouds \
pursued the scatt'ring throng: Now, all united in a goodly team, They skim \
the ground, and seek the quiet stream. As they, with joy returning, clap \
their wings, And ride the circuit of the skies in rings; Not otherwise your \
ships, and ev'ry friend, Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend. \
No more advice is needful; but pursue The path before you, and the town in \
view.\" Thus having said, she turn'd, and made appear Her neck refulgent, and \
dishevel'd hair, Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground. And \
widely spread ambrosial scents around: In length of train descends her \
sweeping gown; And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known. The \
prince pursued the parting deity With words like these: \"Ah! whither do you \
fly? Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son In borrow'd shapes, and his \
embrace to shun; Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown; And still to \
speak in accents not your own.\" Against the goddess these complaints he \
made, But took the path, and her commands obey'd. They march, obscure; for \
Venus kindly shrouds With mists their persons, and involves in clouds, That, \
thus unseen, their passage none might stay, Or force to tell the causes of \
their way. This part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime To visit Paphos and \
her native clime; Where garlands, ever green and ever fair, With vows are \
offer'd, and with solemn pray'r: A hundred altars in her temple smoke; A \
thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke. They climb the next ascent, and, \
looking down, Now at a nearer distance view the town. The prince with wonder \
sees the stately tow'rs, Which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs, \
The gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part, The noise and busy \
concourse of the mart. The toiling Tyrians on each other call To ply their \
labor: some extend the wall; Some build the citadel; the brawny throng Or \
dig, or push unwieldly stones along. Some for their dwellings choose a spot \
of ground, Which, first design'd, with ditches they surround. Some laws \
ordain; and some attend the choice Of holy senates, and elect by voice. Here \
some design a mole, while others there Lay deep foundations for a theater; \
From marble quarries mighty columns hew, For ornaments of scenes, and future \
view. Such is their toil, and such their busy pains, As exercise the bees in \
flow'ry plains, When winter past, and summer scarce begun, Invites them forth \
to labor in the sun; Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense Their \
liquid store, and some in cells dispense; Some at the gate stand ready to \
receive The golden burthen, and their friends relieve; All with united force, \
combine to drive The lazy drones from the laborious hive: With envy stung, \
they view each other's deeds; The fragrant work with diligence proceeds. \
\"Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!\" Aeneas said, and view'd, with \
lifted eyes, Their lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate, Conceal'd in \
clouds (prodigious to relate) He mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng, \
Borne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along. Full in the center of the town \
there stood, Thick set with trees, a venerable wood. The Tyrians, landing \
near this holy ground, And digging here, a prosp'rous omen found: From under \
earth a courser's head they drew, Their growth and future fortune to \
foreshew. This fated sign their foundress Juno gave, Of a soil fruitful, and \
a people brave. Sidonian Dido here with solemn state Did Juno's temple build, \
and consecrate, Enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine; But more the \
goddess made the place divine. On brazen steps the marble threshold rose, And \
brazen plates the cedar beams inclose: The rafters are with brazen cov'rings \
crown'd; The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound. What first Aeneas this place \
beheld, Reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd. For while, expecting \
there the queen, he rais'd His wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd, \
Admir'd the fortune of the rising town, The striving artists, and their arts' \
renown; He saw, in order painted on the wall, Whatever did unhappy Troy \
befall: The wars that fame around the world had blown, All to the life, and \
ev'ry leader known. There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies, And fierce \
Achilles, who both kings defies. He stopp'd, and weeping said: \"O friend! \
ev'n here The monuments of Trojan woes appear! Our known disasters fill ev'n \
foreign lands: See there, where old unhappy Priam stands! Ev'n the mute walls \
relate the warrior's fame, And Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim.\" He \
said (his tears a ready passage find), Devouring what he saw so well \
design'd, And with an empty picture fed his mind: For there he saw the \
fainting Grecians yield, And here the trembling Trojans quit the field, \
Pursued by fierce Achilles thro' the plain, On his high chariot driving o'er \
the slain. The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew, By their white sails \
betray'd to nightly view; And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword The sentries \
slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord, Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet \
the food Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood. Elsewhere he saw \
where Troilus defied Achilles, and unequal combat tried; Then, where the boy \
disarm'd, with loosen'd reins, Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains, \
Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around: The hostile spear, yet \
sticking in his wound, With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground. \
Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe, To Pallas' fane in long \
procession go, In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe. They weep, they beat \
their breasts, they rend their hair, And rich embroider'd vests for presents \
bear; But the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r. Thrice round the \
Trojan walls Achilles drew The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew. Here \
Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold, The lifeless body of his son is \
sold. So sad an object, and so well express'd, Drew sighs and groans from the \
griev'd hero's breast, To see the figure of his lifeless friend, And his old \
sire his helpless hand extend. Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train, Mix'd \
in the bloody battle on the plain; And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew, \
His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew. Penthisilea there, with haughty \
grace, Leads to the wars an Amazonian race: In their right hands a pointed \
dart they wield; The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield. Athwart her \
breast a golden belt she throws, Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand \
foes, And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose. Thus while the Trojan \
prince employs his eyes, Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise, The \
beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred \
fane. Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height, Diana seems; and so she \
charms the sight, When in the dance the graceful goddess leads The choir of \
nymphs, and overtops their heads: Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien, \
She walks majestic, and she looks their queen; Latona sees her shine above \
the rest, And feeds with secret joy her silent breast. Such Dido was; with \
such becoming state, Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great. Their labor \
to her future sway she speeds, And passing with a gracious glance proceeds; \
Then mounts the throne, high plac'd before the shrine: In crowds around, the \
swarming people join. She takes petitions, and dispenses laws, Hears and \
determines ev'ry private cause; Their tasks in equal portions she divides, \
And, where unequal, there by lots decides. Another way by chance Aeneas bends \
His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends, Antheus, Sergestus grave, \
Cloanthus strong, And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng, Whom late the \
tempest on the billows toss'd, And widely scatter'd on another coast. The \
prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands, And longs, with joyful haste, \
to join their hands; But, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays, And from \
the hollow cloud his friends surveys, Impatient till they told their present \
state, And where they left their ships, and what their fate, And why they \
came, and what was their request; For these were sent, commission'd by the \
rest, To sue for leave to land their sickly men, And gain admission to the \
gracious queen. Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane; Then thus, \
with lowly voice, Ilioneus began: \"O queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods To \
found an empire in these new abodes, To build a town, with statutes to \
restrain The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign, We wretched Trojans, toss'd \
on ev'ry shore, From sea to sea, thy clemency implore. Forbid the fires our \
shipping to deface! Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace, And spare the \
remnant of a pious race! We come not with design of wasteful prey, To drive \
the country, force the swains away: Nor such our strength, nor such is our \
desire; The vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire. A land there is, \
Hesperia nam'd of old; The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold- Th' \
Oenotrians held it once- by common fame Now call'd Italia, from the leader's \
name. To that sweet region was our voyage bent, When winds and ev'ry warring \
element Disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land, Cast our torn \
vessels on the moving sand: The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar, \
Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore. Those few you see escap'd \
the Storm, and fear, Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here. What men, what \
monsters, what inhuman race, What laws, what barb'rous customs of the place, \
Shut up a desart shore to drowning men, And drive us to the cruel seas again? \
If our hard fortune no compassion draws, Nor hospitable rights, nor human \
laws, The gods are just, and will revenge our cause. Aeneas was our prince: a \
juster lord, Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword; Observant of the right, \
religious of his word. If yet he lives, and draws this vital air, Nor we, his \
friends, of safety shall despair; Nor you, great queen, these offices repent, \
Which he will equal, and perhaps augment. We want not cities, nor Sicilian \
coasts, Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts. Permit our ships a shelter \
on your shores, Refitted from your woods with planks and oars, That, if our \
prince be safe, we may renew Our destin'd course, and Italy pursue. But if, O \
best of men, the Fates ordain That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main, And \
if our young Iulus be no more, Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore, \
That we to good Acestes may return, And with our friends our common losses \
mourn.\" Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew With cries and clamors his \
request renew. The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes, Ponder'd the \
speech; then briefly thus replies: \"Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel \
fate, And doubts attending an unsettled state, Force me to guard my coast \
from foreign foes. Who has not heard the story of your woes, The name and \
fortune of your native place, The fame and valor of the Phrygian race? We \
Tyrians are not so devoid of sense, Nor so remote from Phoebus' influence. \
Whether to Latian shores your course is bent, Or, driv'n by tempests from \
your first intent, You seek the good Acestes' government, Your men shall be \
receiv'd, your fleet repair'd, And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard: \
Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs To raise and to defend the \
Tyrian tow'rs, My wealth, my city, and myself are yours. And would to Heav'n, \
the Storm, you felt, would bring On Carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king. \
My people shall, by my command, explore The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding \
shore, And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest Of so renown'd and so \
desir'd a guest.\" Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood, And long'd to \
break from out his ambient cloud: Achates found it, and thus urg'd his way: \
\"From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay? What more can you desire, \
your welcome sure, Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure? One only \
wants; and him we saw in vain Oppose the Storm, and swallow'd in the main. \
Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid; The rest agrees with what your mother \
said.\" Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way, The mists flew upward \
and dissolv'd in day. The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight, August in \
visage, and serenely bright. His mother goddess, with her hands divine, Had \
form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine, And giv'n his rolling \
eyes a sparkling grace, And breath'd a youthful vigor on his face; Like \
polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold, Or Parian marble, when enchas'd in gold: \
Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke, And thus with manly modesty he \
spoke: \"He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd, And sav'd from shipwreck \
on your Libyan coast; Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne, A \
prince that owes his life to you alone. Fair majesty, the refuge and redress \
Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress, You, who your pious offices \
employ To save the relics of abandon'd Troy; Receive the shipwreck'd on your \
friendly shore, With hospitable rites relieve the poor; Associate in your \
town a wand'ring train, And strangers in your palace entertain: What thanks \
can wretched fugitives return, Who, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile \
mourn? The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd; If acts of mercy touch \
their heav'nly mind, And, more than all the gods, your gen'rous heart. \
Conscious of worth, requite its own desert! In you this age is happy, and \
this earth, And parents more than mortal gave you birth. While rolling rivers \
into seas shall run, And round the space of heav'n the radiant sun; While \
trees the mountain tops with shades supply, Your honor, name, and praise \
shall never die. Whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd, Your image shall be \
present in my mind.\" Thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste, And \
joyful his expecting friends embrac'd: With his right hand Ilioneus was \
grac'd, Serestus with his left; then to his breast Cloanthus and the noble \
Gyas press'd; And so by turns descended to the rest. The Tyrian queen stood \
fix'd upon his face, Pleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace; \
Admir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man; Then recollected stood, and thus \
began: \"What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow'rs Have cast you \
shipwrack'd on our barren shores? Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame, \
Who from celestial seed your lineage claim? The same Aeneas whom fair Venus \
bore To fam'd Anchises on th' Idaean shore? It calls into my mind, tho' then \
a child, When Teucer came, from Salamis exil'd, And sought my father's aid, \
to be restor'd: My father Belus then with fire and sword Invaded Cyprus, made \
the region bare, And, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful war. From him the \
Trojan siege I understood, The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood. \
Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais'd, And his own ancestry from Trojans \
rais'd. Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find, If not a costly welcome, \
yet a kind: For I myself, like you, have been distress'd, Till Heav'n \
afforded me this place of rest; Like you, an alien in a land unknown, I learn \
to pity woes so like my own.\" She said, and to the palace led her guest; \
Then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast. Nor yet less careful for her \
absent friends, Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends; Besides a hundred \
boars, a hundred lambs, With bleating cries, attend their milky dams; And \
jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls She gives, to cheer the sailors' \
drooping souls. Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls, And sumptuous \
feasts are made in splendid halls: On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they \
dine; With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine, And antique vases, all \
of gold emboss'd (The gold itself inferior to the cost), Of curious work, \
where on the sides were seen The fights and figures of illustrious men, From \
their first founder to the present queen. The good Aeneas, paternal care \
Iulus' absence could no longer bear, Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in \
haste, To give a glad relation of the past, And, fraught with precious gifts, \
to bring the boy, Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy: A robe of tissue, \
stiff with golden wire; An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire, From Argos \
by the fam'd adultress brought, With golden flow'rs and winding foliage \
wrought, Her mother Leda's present, when she came To ruin Troy and set the \
world on flame; The scepter Priam's eldest daughter bore, Her orient \
necklace, and the crown she wore Of double texture, glorious to behold, One \
order set with gems, and one with gold. Instructed thus, the wise Achates \
goes, And in his diligence his duty shows. But Venus, anxious for her son's \
affairs, New counsels tries, and new designs prepares: That Cupid should \
assume the shape and face Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace; Should \
bring the presents, in her nephew's stead, And in Eliza's veins the gentle \
poison shed: For much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued, And knew the \
town to Juno's care belong'd. These thoughts by night her golden slumbers \
broke, And thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke: \"My son, my strength, \
whose mighty pow'r alone Controls the Thund'rer on his awful throne, To thee \
thy much-afflicted mother flies, And on thy succor and thy faith relies. Thou \
know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife, By force and fraud, attempts thy \
brother's life; And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains. Him Dido now \
with blandishment detains; But I suspect the town where Juno reigns. For this \
't is needful to prevent her art, And fire with love the proud Phoenician's \
heart: A love so violent, so strong, so sure, As neither age can change, nor \
art can cure. How this may be perform'd, now take my mind: Ascanius by his \
father is design'd To come, with presents laden, from the port, To gratify \
the queen, and gain the court. I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep, \
And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep, Or high Cythera, that the sweet \
deceit May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat. Take thou his form and \
shape. I beg the grace But only for a night's revolving space: Thyself a boy, \
assume a boy's dissembled face; That when, amidst the fervor of the feast, \
The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast, And with sweet kisses in her \
arms constrains, Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins.\" The God of Love \
obeys, and sets aside His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride; He walks Iulus \
in his mother's sight, And in the sweet resemblance takes delight. The \
goddess then to young Ascanius flies, And in a pleasing slumber seals his \
eyes: Lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves, She gently bears him to her \
blissful groves, Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head, And softly \
lays him on a flow'ry bed. Cupid meantime assum'd his form and face, \
Foll'wing Achates with a shorter pace, And brought the gifts. The queen \
already sate Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state, High on a golden bed: \
her princely guest Was next her side; in order sate the rest. Then canisters \
with bread are heap'd on high; Th' attendants water for their hands supply, \
And, having wash'd, with silken towels dry. Next fifty handmaids in long \
order bore The censers, and with fumes the gods adore: Then youths, and \
virgins twice as many, join To place the dishes, and to serve the wine. The \
Tyrian train, admitted to the feast, Approach, and on the painted couches \
rest. All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze, But view the beauteous boy \
with more amaze, His rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant eyes, His motions, \
voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise; Nor pass unprais'd the vest and \
veil divine, Which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine. But, far above \
the rest, the royal dame, (Already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,) With \
eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy, Beholds the presents, and admires the \
boy. The guileful god about the hero long, With children's play, and false \
embraces, hung; Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms With greedy \
pleasure, and devour'd his charms. Unhappy Dido little thought what guest, \
How dire a god, she drew so near her breast; But he, not mindless of his \
mother's pray'r, Works in the pliant bosom of the fair, And molds her heart \
anew, and blots her former care. The dead is to the living love resign'd; And \
all Aeneas enters in her mind. Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd, The \
meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd, The golden bowls with sparkling \
wine are crown'd, And thro' the palace cheerful cries resound. From gilded \
roofs depending lamps display Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day. A golden \
bowl, that shone with gems divine, The queen commanded to be crown'd with \
wine: The bowl that Belus us'd, and all the Tyrian line. Then, silence thro' \
the hall proclaim'd, she spoke: \"O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke, With \
solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r; Bless to both nations this \
auspicious hour! So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line In lasting concord \
from this day combine. Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer, And \
gracious Juno, both be present here! And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows \
address To Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace.\" The goblet then she took, \
with nectar crown'd (Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,) And \
rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace; Then, sipping, offer'd to the next \
in place. 'T was Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul; He took challenge, \
and embrac'd the bowl, With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw, \
Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw. The goblet goes around: Iopas brought \
His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught: The various labors of \
the wand'ring moon, And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun; Th' original \
of men and beasts; and whence The rains arise, and fires their warmth \
dispense, And fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence; What shakes the \
solid earth; what cause delays The summer nights and shortens winter days. \
With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song: Those peals are echo'd by \
the Trojan throng. Th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night, And drank \
large draughts of love with vast delight; Of Priam much enquir'd, of Hector \
more; Then ask'd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore, What troops he landed on \
the Trojan shore; The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse, And fierce \
Achilles, with his matchless force; At length, as fate and her ill stars \
requir'd, To hear the series of the war desir'd. \"Relate at large, my \
godlike guest,\" she said, \"The Grecian stratagems, the town betray'd: The \
fatal issue of so long a war, Your flight, your wand'rings, and your woes, \
declare; For, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast, Your men have been \
distress'd, your navy toss'd, Sev'n times the sun has either tropic view'd, \
The winter banish'd, and the spring renew'd.\" BOOK II All were attentive to \
the godlike man, When from his lofty couch he thus began: \"Great queen, what \
you command me to relate Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: An empire \
from its old foundations rent, And ev'ry woe the Trojans underwent; A peopled \
city made a desart place; All that I saw, and part of which I was: Not ev'n \
the hardest of our foes could hear, Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. \
And now the latter watch of wasting night, And setting stars, to kindly rest \
invite; But, since you take such int'rest in our woe, And Troy's disastrous \
end desire to know, I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell What in our \
last and fatal night befell. \"By destiny compell'd, and in despair, The \
Greeks grew weary of the tedious war, And by Minerva's aid a fabric rear'd, \
Which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd: The sides were plank'd with \
pine; they feign'd it made For their return, and this the vow they paid. Thus \
they pretend, but in the hollow side Selected numbers of their soldiers hide: \
With inward arms the dire machine they load, And iron bowels stuff the dark \
abode. In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle (While Fortune did on Priam's \
empire smile) Renown'd for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay, Where ships \
expos'd to wind and weather lay. There was their fleet conceal'd. We thought, \
for Greece Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release. The Trojans, \
coop'd within their walls so long, Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng, \
Like swarming bees, and with delight survey The camp deserted, where the \
Grecians lay: The quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd; Here Phoenix, \
here Achilles, made abode; Here join'd the battles; there the navy rode. Part \
on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ: The pile by Pallas rais'd to ruin \
Troy. Thymoetes first ('t is doubtful whether hir'd, Or so the Trojan destiny \
requir'd) Mov'd that the ramparts might be broken down, To lodge the monster \
fabric in the town. But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind, The fatal \
present to the flames designed, Or to the wat'ry deep; at least to bore The \
hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore. The giddy vulgar, as their fancies \
guide, With noise say nothing, and in parts divide. Laocoon, follow'd by a \
num'rous crowd, Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud: 'O wretched \
countrymen! what fury reigns? What more than madness has possess'd your \
brains? Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone? And are Ulysses' \
arts no better known? This hollow fabric either must inclose, Within its \
blind recess, our secret foes; Or 't is an engine rais'd above the town, T' \
o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down. Somewhat is sure design'd, by \
fraud or force: Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.' Thus having \
said, against the steed he threw His forceful spear, which, hissing as flew, \
Pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood, And trembling in the \
hollow belly stood. The sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound, And \
groans of Greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound And, had not Heav'n \
the fall of Troy design'd, Or had not men been fated to be blind, Enough was \
said and done t'inspire a better mind. Then had our lances pierc'd the \
treach'rous wood, And Ilian tow'rs and Priam's empire stood. Meantime, with \
shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring A captive Greek, in bands, before the \
king; Taken to take; who made himself their prey, T' impose on their belief, \
and Troy betray; Fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent To die undaunted, or \
to circumvent. About the captive, tides of Trojans flow; All press to see, \
and some insult the foe. Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis'd; \
Behold a nation in a man compris'd. Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd \
and bound; He star'd, and roll'd his haggard eyes around, Then said: 'Alas! \
what earth remains, what sea Is open to receive unhappy me? What fate a \
wretched fugitive attends, Scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?' He \
said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye: Our pity kindles, and our passions \
die. We cheer youth to make his own defense, And freely tell us what he was, \
and whence: What news he could impart, we long to know, And what to credit \
from a captive foe. \"His fear at length dismiss'd, he said: 'Whate'er My \
fate ordains, my words shall be sincere: I neither can nor dare my birth \
disclaim; Greece is my country, Sinon is my name. Tho' plung'd by Fortune's \
pow'r in misery, 'T is not in Fortune's pow'r to make me lie. If any chance \
has hither brought the name Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame, Who suffer'd \
from the malice of the times, Accus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes, \
Because these fatal wars he would prevent; Whose death the wretched Greeks \
too late lament- Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare Of other means, \
committed to his care, His kinsman and companion in the war. While Fortune \
favor'd, while his arms support The cause, and rul'd the counsels, of the \
court, I made some figure there; nor was my name Obscure, nor I without my \
share of fame. But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts, Had made impression in \
the people's hearts, And forg'd a treason in my patron's name (I speak of \
things too far divulg'd by fame), My kinsman fell. Then I, without support, \
In private mourn'd his loss, and left the court. Mad as I was, I could not \
bear his fate With silent grief, but loudly blam'd the state, And curs'd the \
direful author of my woes. 'T was told again; and hence my ruin rose. I \
threaten'd, if indulgent Heav'n once more Would land me safely on my native \
shore, His death with double vengeance to restore. This mov'd the murderer's \
hate; and soon ensued Th' effects of malice from a man so proud. Ambiguous \
rumors thro' the camp he spread, And sought, by treason, my devoted head; New \
crimes invented; left unturn'd no stone, To make my guilt appear, and hide \
his own; Till Calchas was by force and threat'ning wrought- But why- why \
dwell I on that anxious thought? If on my nation just revenge you seek, And \
't is t' appear a foe, t' appear a Greek; Already you my name and country \
know; Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow: My death will both \
the kingly brothers please, And set insatiate Ithacus at ease.' This fair \
unfinish'd tale, these broken starts, Rais'd expectations in our longing \
hearts: Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts. His former trembling once again \
renew'd, With acted fear, the villain thus pursued: \"'Long had the Grecians \
(tir'd with fruitless care, And wearied with an unsuccessful war) Resolv'd to \
raise the siege, and leave the town; And, had the gods permitted, they had \
gone; But oft the wintry seas and southern winds Withstood their passage \
home, and chang'd their minds. Portents and prodigies their souls amaz'd; But \
most, when this stupendous pile was rais'd: Then flaming meteors, hung in \
air, were seen, And thunders rattled thro' a sky serene. Dismay'd, and \
fearful of some dire event, Eurypylus t' enquire their fate was sent. He from \
the gods this dreadful answer brought: \"O Grecians, when the Trojan shores \
you sought, Your passage with a virgin's blood was bought: So must your safe \
return be bought again, And Grecian blood once more atone the main.\" The \
spreading rumor round the people ran; All fear'd, and each believ'd himself \
the man. Ulysses took th' advantage of their fright; Call'd Calchas, and \
produc'd in open sight: Then bade him name the wretch, ordain'd by fate The \
public victim, to redeem the state. Already some presag'd the dire event, And \
saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant. For twice five days the good old seer \
withstood Th' intended treason, and was dumb to blood, Till, tir'd, with \
endless clamors and pursuit Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute; But, as it \
was agreed, pronounc'd that I Was destin'd by the wrathful gods to die. All \
prais'd the sentence, pleas'd the storm should fall On one alone, whose fury \
threaten'd all. The dismal day was come; the priests prepare Their leaven'd \
cakes, and fillets for my hair. I follow'd nature's laws, and must avow I \
broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow. Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay, \
Secure of safety when they sail'd away. But now what further hopes for me \
remain, To see my friends, or native soil, again; My tender infants, or my \
careful sire, Whom they returning will to death require; Will perpetrate on \
them their first design, And take the forfeit of their heads for mine? Which, \
O! if pity mortal minds can move, If there be faith below, or gods above, If \
innocence and truth can claim desert, Ye Trojans, from an injur'd wretch \
avert.' \"False tears true pity move; the king commands To loose his fetters, \
and unbind his hands: Then adds these friendly words: 'Dismiss thy fears; \
Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs. But truly tell, was it for \
force or guile, Or some religious end, you rais'd the pile?' Thus said the \
king. He, full of fraudful arts, This well-invented tale for truth imparts: \
'Ye lamps of heav'n!' he said, and lifted high His hands now free, 'thou \
venerable sky! Inviolable pow'rs, ador'd with dread! Ye fatal fillets, that \
once bound this head! Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled! Be all of \
you adjur'd; and grant I may, Without a crime, th' ungrateful Greeks betray, \
Reveal the secrets of the guilty state, And justly punish whom I justly hate! \
But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave, If I, to save myself, your \
empire save. The Grecian hopes, and all th' attempts they made, Were only \
founded on Minerva's aid. But from the time when impious Diomede, And false \
Ulysses, that inventive head, Her fatal image from the temple drew, The \
sleeping guardians of the castle slew, Her virgin statue with their bloody \
hands Polluted, and profan'd her holy bands; From thence the tide of fortune \
left their shore, And ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before: Their courage \
languish'd, as their hopes decay'd; And Pallas, now averse, refus'd her aid. \
Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare Her alter'd mind and alienated care. \
When first her fatal image touch'd the ground, She sternly cast her glaring \
eyes around, That sparkled as they roll'd, and seem'd to threat: Her heav'nly \
limbs distill'd a briny sweat. Thrice from the ground she leap'd, was seen to \
wield Her brandish'd lance, and shake her horrid shield. Then Calchas bade \
our host for flight And hope no conquest from the tedious war, Till first \
they sail'd for Greece; with pray'rs besought Her injur'd pow'r, and better \
omens brought. And now their navy plows the wat'ry main, Yet soon expect it \
on your shores again, With Pallas pleas'd; as Calchas did ordain. But first, \
to reconcile the blue-ey'd maid For her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd, \
Warn'd by the seer, to her offended name We rais'd and dedicate this wondrous \
frame, So lofty, lest thro' your forbidden gates It pass, and intercept our \
better fates: For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost; And Troy may then \
a new Palladium boast; For so religion and the gods ordain, That, if you \
violate with hands profane Minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn, \
(Which omen, O ye gods, on Graecia turn!) But if it climb, with your \
assisting hands, The Trojan walls, and in the city stands; Then Troy shall \
Argos and Mycenae burn, And the reverse of fate on us return.' \"With such \
deceits he gain'd their easy hearts, Too prone to credit his perfidious arts. \
What Diomede, nor Thetis' greater son, A thousand ships, nor ten years' \
siege, had done- False tears and fawning words the city won. \"A greater \
omen, and of worse portent, Did our unwary minds with fear torment, \
Concurring to produce the dire event. Laocoon, Neptune's priest by lot that \
year, With solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer; When, dreadful to behold, \
from sea we spied Two serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide, And smoothly \
sweep along the swelling tide. Their flaming crests above the waves they \
show; Their bellies seem to burn the seas below; Their speckled tails advance \
to steer their course, And on the sounding shore the flying billows force. \
And now the strand, and now the plain they held; Their ardent eyes with \
bloody streaks were fill'd; Their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they \
came, And lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame. We fled amaz'd; \
their destin'd way they take, And to Laocoon and his children make; And first \
around the tender boys they wind, Then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs \
and bodies grind. The wretched father, running to their aid With pious haste, \
but vain, they next invade; Twice round his waist their winding volumes \
roll'd; And twice about his gasping throat they fold. The priest thus doubly \
chok'd, their crests divide, And tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride. With \
both his hands he labors at the knots; His holy fillets the blue venom blots; \
His roaring fills the flitting air around. Thus, when an ox receives a \
glancing wound, He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies, And with loud \
bellowings breaks the yielding skies. Their tasks perform'd, the serpents \
quit their prey, And to the tow'r of Pallas make their way: Couch'd at her \
feet, they lie protected there By her large buckler and protended spear. \
Amazement seizes all; the gen'ral cry Proclaims Laocoon justly doom'd to die, \
Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood, And dared to violate the sacred \
wood. All vote t' admit the steed, that vows be paid And incense offer'd to \
th' offended maid. A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare; Some \
hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare And fasten to the horse's feet; the \
rest With cables haul along th' unwieldly beast. Each on his fellow for \
assistance calls; At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls, Big with \
destruction. Boys with chaplets crown'd, And choirs of virgins, sing and \
dance around. Thus rais'd aloft, and then descending down, It enters o'er our \
heads, and threats the town. O sacred city, built by hands divine! O valiant \
heroes of the Trojan line! Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound Of \
arms was heard, and inward groans rebound. Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded \
with our fate, We haul along the horse in solemn state; Then place the dire \
portent within the tow'r. Cassandra cried, and curs'd th' unhappy hour; \
Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree, All heard, and none believ'd the \
prophecy. With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste, In jollity, the day \
ordain'd to be the last. Meantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the light, \
And on the shaded ocean rush'd the night; Our men, secure, nor guards nor \
sentries held, But easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd. The Grecians had \
embark'd their naval pow'rs From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores, \
Safe under covert of the silent night, And guided by th' imperial galley's \
light; When Sinon, favor'd by the partial gods, Unlock'd the horse, and op'd \
his dark abodes; Restor'd to vital air our hidden foes, Who joyful from their \
long confinement rose. Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide, And dire \
Ulysses down the cable slide: Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste; Nor was \
the Podalirian hero last, Nor injur'd Menelaus, nor the fam'd Epeus, who the \
fatal engine fram'd. A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join T' invade \
the town, oppress'd with sleep and wine. Those few they find awake first meet \
their fate; Then to their fellows they unbar the gate. \"'T was in the dead \
of night, when sleep repairs Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with \
cares, When Hector's ghost before my sight appears: A bloody shroud he \
seem'd, and bath'd in tears; Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain, \
Thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain. Swoln were his feet, as when \
the thongs were thrust Thro' the bor'd holes; his body black with dust; \
Unlike that Hector who return'd from toils Of war, triumphant, in Aeacian \
spoils, Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire, And launch'd against \
their navy Phrygian fire. His hair and beard stood stiffen'd with his gore; \
And all the wounds he for his country bore Now stream'd afresh, and with new \
purple ran. I wept to see the visionary man, And, while my trance continued, \
thus began: 'O light of Trojans, and support of Troy, Thy father's champion, \
and thy country's joy! O, long expected by thy friends! from whence Art thou \
so late return'd for our defense? Do we behold thee, wearied as we are With \
length of labors, and with toils of war? After so many fun'rals of thy own \
Art thou restor'd to thy declining town? But say, what wounds are these? What \
new disgrace Deforms the manly features of thy face?' \"To this the specter \
no reply did frame, But answer'd to the cause for which he came, And, \
groaning from the bottom of his breast, This warning in these mournful words \
express'd: 'O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight, The flames and horrors \
of this fatal night. The foes already have possess'd the wall; Troy nods from \
high, and totters to her fall. Enough is paid to Priam's royal name, More \
than enough to duty and to fame. If by a mortal hand my father's throne Could \
be defended, 't was by mine alone. Now Troy to thee commends her future \
state, And gives her gods companions of thy fate: From their assistance walls \
expect, Which, wand'ring long, at last thou shalt erect.' He said, and \
brought me, from their blest abodes, The venerable statues of the gods, With \
ancient Vesta from the sacred choir, The wreaths and relics of th' immortal \
fire. \"Now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar, Cries, threats, and \
loud laments, and mingled war: The noise approaches, tho' our palace stood \
Aloof from streets, encompass'd with a wood. Louder, and yet more loud, I \
hear th' alarms Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms. Fear broke my \
slumbers; I no longer stay, But mount the terrace, thence the town survey, \
And hearken what the frightful sounds convey. Thus, when a flood of fire by \
wind is borne, Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn; Or deluges, \
descending on the plains, Sweep o'er the yellow year, destroy the pains Of \
lab'ring oxen and the peasant's gains; Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away \
Flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish'd prey: The shepherd climbs the \
cliff, and sees from far The wasteful ravage of the wat'ry war. Then Hector's \
faith was manifestly clear'd, And Grecian frauds in open light appear'd. The \
palace of Deiphobus ascends In smoky flames, and catches on his friends. \
Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright With splendor not their own, and \
shine with Trojan light. New clamors and new clangors now arise, The sound of \
trumpets mix'd with fighting cries. With frenzy seiz'd, I run to meet th' \
alarms, Resolv'd on death, resolv'd to die in arms, But first to gather \
friends, with them t' oppose (If fortune favor'd) and repel the foes; Spurr'd \
by my courage, by my country fir'd, With sense of honor and revenge inspir'd. \
\"Pantheus, Apollo's priest, a sacred name, Had scap'd the Grecian swords, \
and pass'd the flame: With relics loaden. to my doors he fled, And by the \
hand his tender grandson led. 'What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run? \
Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?' Scarce had I said, when \
Pantheus, with a groan: 'Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town! The fatal \
day, th' appointed hour, is come, When wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom \
Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands. The fire consumes the town, the \
foe commands; And armed hosts, an unexpected force, Break from the bowels of \
the fatal horse. Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about The flames; and \
foes for entrance press without, With thousand others, whom I fear to name, \
More than from Argos or Mycenae came. To sev'ral posts their parties they \
divide; Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide: The bold they \
kill, th' unwary they surprise; Who fights finds death, and death finds him \
who flies. The warders of the gate but scarce maintain Th' unequal combat, \
and resist in vain.' \"I heard; and Heav'n, that well-born souls inspires, \
Prompts me thro' lifted swords and rising fires To run where clashing arms \
and clamor calls, And rush undaunted to defend the walls. Ripheus and \
Iph'itus by my side engage, For valor one renown'd, and one for age. Dymas \
and Hypanis by moonlight knew My motions and my mien, and to my party drew; \
With young Coroebus, who by love was led To win renown and fair Cassandra's \
bed, And lately brought his troops to Priam's aid, Forewarn'd in vain by the \
prophetic maid. Whom when I saw resolv'd in arms to fall, And that one spirit \
animated all: 'Brave souls!' said I,- 'but brave, alas! in vain- Come, finish \
what our cruel fates ordain. You see the desp'rate state of our affairs, And \
heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs. The passive gods behold the \
Greeks defile Their temples, and abandon to the spoil Their own abodes: we, \
feeble few, conspire To save a sinking town, involv'd in fire. Then let us \
fall, but fall amidst our foes: Despair of life the means of living shows.' \
So bold a speech incourag'd their desire Of death, and added fuel to their \
fire. \"As hungry wolves, with raging appetite, Scour thro' the fields, nor \
fear the stormy night- Their whelps at home expect the promis'd food, And \
long to temper their dry chaps in blood- So rush'd we forth at once; resolv'd \
to die, Resolv'd, in death, the last extremes to try. We leave the narrow \
lanes behind, and dare Th' unequal combat in the public square: Night was our \
friend; our leader was despair. What tongue can tell the slaughter of that \
night? What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright? An ancient and imperial \
city falls: The streets are fill'd with frequent funerals; Houses and holy \
temples float in blood, And hostile nations make a common flood. Not only \
Trojans fall; but, in their turn, The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors \
mourn. Ours take new courage from despair and night: Confus'd the fortune is, \
confus'd the fight. All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears; And \
grisly Death in sundry shapes appears. Androgeos fell among us, with his \
band, Who thought us Grecians newly come to land. 'From whence,' said he, 'my \
friends, this long delay? You loiter, while the spoils are borne away: Our \
ships are laden with the Trojan store; And you, like truants, come too late \
ashore.' He said, but soon corrected his mistake, Found, by the doubtful \
answers which we make: Amaz'd, he would have shunn'd th' unequal fight; But \
we, more num'rous, intercept his flight. As when some peasant, in a bushy \
brake, Has with unwary footing press'd a snake; He starts aside, astonish'd, \
when he spies His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes; So from our arms \
surpris'd Androgeos flies. In vain; for him and his we compass'd round, \
Possess'd with fear, unknowing of the ground, And of their lives an easy \
conquest found. Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil'd. Coroebus then, \
with youthful hopes beguil'd, Swoln with success, and a daring mind, This new \
invention fatally design'd. 'My friends,' said he, 'since Fortune shows the \
way, 'T is fit we should th' auspicious guide obey. For what has she these \
Grecian arms bestow'd, But their destruction, and the Trojans' good? Then \
change we shields, and their devices bear: Let fraud supply the want of force \
in war. They find us arms.' This said, himself he dress'd In dead Androgeos' \
spoils, his upper vest, His painted buckler, and his plumy crest. Thus \
Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train, Lay down their own attire, and strip \
the slain. Mix'd with the Greeks, we go with ill presage, Flatter'd with \
hopes to glut our greedy rage; Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet, And \
strew with Grecian carcasses the street. Thus while their straggling parties \
we defeat, Some to the shore and safer ships retreat; And some, oppress'd \
with more ignoble fear, Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there. \
\"But, ah! what use of valor can be made, When heav'n's propitious pow'rs \
refuse their aid! Behold the royal prophetess, the fair Cassandra, dragg'd by \
her dishevel'd hair, Whom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands, In safety \
could protect from sacrilegious hands: On heav'n she cast her eyes, she \
sigh'd, she cried- 'T was all she could- her tender arms were tied. So sad a \
sight Coroebus could not bear; But, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair, \
Amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew: Our leader's rash example we pursue. \
But storms of stones, from the proud temple's height, Pour down, and on our \
batter'd helms alight: We from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow, Who \
thought us Grecians, as we seem'd in show. They aim at the mistaken crests, \
from high; And ours beneath the pond'rous ruin lie. Then, mov'd with anger \
and disdain, to see Their troops dispers'd, the royal virgin free, The \
Grecians rally, and their pow'rs unite, With fury charge us, and renew the \
fight. The brother kings with Ajax join their force, And the whole squadron \
of Thessalian horse. \"Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try, \
Contending for the kingdom of the sky, South, east, and west, on airy \
coursers borne; The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn: Then Nereus \
strikes the deep; the billows rise, And, mix'd with ooze and sand, pollute \
the skies. The troops we squander'd first again appear From several quarters, \
and enclose the rear. They first observe, and to the rest betray, Our \
diff'rent speech; our borrow'd arms survey. Oppress'd with odds, we fall; \
Coroebus first, At Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierc'd. Then Ripheus follow'd, \
in th' unequal fight; Just of his word, observant of the right: Heav'n \
thought not so. Dymas their fate attends, With Hypanis, mistaken by their \
friends. Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands Of awful Phoebus, \
sav'd from impious hands. Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear, What I \
perform'd, and what I suffer'd there; No sword avoiding in the fatal strife, \
Expos'd to death, and prodigal of life; Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my \
fault: I strove to have deserv'd the death I sought. But, when I could not \
fight, and would have died, Borne off to distance by the growing tide, Old \
Iphitus and I were hurried thence, With Pelias wounded, and without defense. \
New clamors from th' invested palace ring: We run to die, or disengage the \
king. So hot th' assault, so high the tumult rose, While ours defend, and \
while the Greeks oppose As all the Dardan and Argolic race Had been \
contracted in that narrow space; Or as all Ilium else were void of fear, And \
tumult, war, and slaughter, only there. Their targets in a tortoise cast, the \
foes, Secure advancing, to the turrets rose: Some mount the scaling ladders; \
some, more bold, Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold; Their left \
hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent, While with their right they seize \
the battlement. From their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans throw Huge heaps of \
stones, that, falling, crush the foe; And heavy beams and rafters from the \
sides (Such arms their last necessity provides) And gilded roofs, come \
tumbling from on high, The marks of state and ancient royalty. The guards \
below, fix'd in the pass, attend The charge undaunted, and the gate defend. \
Renew'd in courage with recover'd breath, A second time we ran to tempt our \
death, To clear the palace from the foe, succeed The weary living, and \
revenge the dead. \"A postern door, yet unobserv'd and free, Join'd by the \
length of a blind gallery, To the king's closet led: a way well known To \
Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne, Thro' which she brought Astyanax, \
unseen, To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen. Thro' this we pass, \
and mount the tow'r, from whence With unavailing arms the Trojans make \
defense. From this the trembling king had oft descried The Grecian camp, and \
saw their navy ride. Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew, Then, \
wrenching with our hands, th' assault renew; And, where the rafters on the \
columns meet, We push them headlong with our arms and feet. The lightning \
flies not swifter than the fall, Nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall: \
Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath Are piecemeal torn, or pounded \
into death. Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent; We cease not from \
above, nor they below relent. Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat'ning \
loud, With glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd. So shines, renew'd in \
youth, the crested snake, Who slept the winter in a thorny brake, And, \
casting off his slough when spring returns, Now looks aloft, and with new \
glory burns; Restor'd with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides Reflect the sun; \
and rais'd on spires he rides; High o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along, \
And brandishes by fits his forky tongue. Proud Periphas, and fierce \
Automedon, His father's charioteer, together run To force the gate; the \
Scyrian infantry Rush on in crowds, and the barr'd passage free. Ent'ring the \
court, with shouts the skies they rend; And flaming firebrands to the roofs \
ascend. Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows, And with his ax \
repeated strokes bestows On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply, \
Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly. He hews apace; the double bars at \
length Yield to his ax and unresisted strength. A mighty breach is made: the \
rooms conceal'd Appear, and all the palace is reveal'd; The halls of \
audience, and of public state, And where the lonely queen in secret sate. \
Arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen, With not a door, and scarce a \
space, between. The house is fill'd with loud laments and cries, And shrieks \
of women rend the vaulted skies; The fearful matrons run from place to place, \
And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace. The fatal work inhuman \
Pyrrhus plies, And all his father sparkles in his eyes; Nor bars, nor \
fighting guards, his force sustain: The bars are broken, and the guards are \
slain. In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill; Those few defendants \
whom they find, they kill. Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood Roars, \
when he finds his rapid course withstood; Bears down the dams with unresisted \
sway, And sweeps the cattle and the cots away. These eyes beheld him when he \
march'd between The brother kings: I saw th' unhappy queen, The hundred \
wives, and where old Priam stood, To stain his hallow'd altar with his brood. \
The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he, So large a promise, of a progeny), \
The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils, Fell the reward of the proud \
victor's toils. Where'er the raging fire had left a space, The Grecians enter \
and possess the place. \"Perhaps you may of Priam's fate enquire. He, when he \
saw his regal town on fire, His ruin'd palace, and his ent'ring foes, On \
ev'ry side inevitable woes, In arms, disus'd, invests his limbs, decay'd, \
Like them, with age; a late and useless aid. His feeble shoulders scarce the \
weight sustain; Loaded, not arm'd, he creeps along with pain, Despairing of \
success, ambitious to be slain! Uncover'd but by heav'n, there stood in view \
An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew, Dodder'd with age, whose boughs \
encompass round The household gods, and shade the holy ground. Here Hecuba, \
with all her helpless train Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain. \
Driv'n like a flock of doves along the sky, Their images they hug, and to \
their altars fly. The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord, And hanging \
by his side a heavy sword, 'What rage,' she cried, 'has seiz'd my husband's \
mind? What arms are these, and to what use design'd? These times want other \
aids! Were Hector here, Ev'n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear. \
With us, one common shelter thou shalt find, Or in one common fate with us be \
join'd.' She said, and with a last salute embrac'd The poor old man, and by \
the laurel plac'd. Behold! Polites, one of Priam's sons, Pursued by Pyrrhus, \
there for safety runs. Thro' swords and foes, amaz'd and hurt, he flies Thro' \
empty courts and open galleries. Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues, \
And often reaches, and his thrusts renews. The youth, transfix'd, with \
lamentable cries, Expires before his wretched parent's eyes: Whom gasping at \
his feet when Priam saw, The fear of death gave place to nature's law; And, \
shaking more with anger than with age, 'The gods,' said he, 'requite thy \
brutal rage! As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must, If there be gods \
in heav'n, and gods be just- Who tak'st in wrongs an insolent delight; With a \
son's death t' infect a father's sight. Not he, whom thou and lying fame \
conspire To call thee his- not he, thy vaunted sire, Thus us'd my wretched \
age: the gods he fear'd, The laws of nature and of nations heard. He cheer'd \
my sorrows, and, for sums of gold, The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold; \
Pitied the woes a parent underwent, And sent me back in safety from his \
tent.' \"This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw, Which, flutt'ring, \
seem'd to loiter as it flew: Just, and but barely, to the mark it held, And \
faintly tinkled on the brazen shield. \"Then Pyrrhus thus: 'Go thou from me \
to fate, And to my father my foul deeds relate. Now die!' With that he \
dragg'd the trembling sire, Slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire, \
(The mingled paste his murder'd son had made,) Haul'd from beneath the \
violated shade, And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid. His right hand \
held his bloody falchion bare, His left he twisted in his hoary hair; Then, \
with a speeding thrust, his heart he found: The lukewarm blood came rushing \
thro' the wound, And sanguine streams distain'd the sacred ground. Thus Priam \
fell, and shar'd one common fate With Troy in ashes, and his ruin'd state: \
He, who the scepter of all Asia sway'd, Whom monarchs like domestic slaves \
obey'd. On the bleak shore now lies th' abandon'd king, A headless carcass, \
and a nameless thing. \"Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood Congeal \
with fear, my hair with horror stood: My father's image fill'd my pious mind, \
Lest equal years might equal fortune find. Again I thought on my forsaken \
wife, And trembled for my son's abandon'd life. I look'd about, but found \
myself alone, Deserted at my need! My friends were gone. Some spent with \
toil, some with despair oppress'd, Leap'd headlong from the heights; the \
flames consum'd the rest. Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide, The \
graceless Helen in the porch I spied Of Vesta's temple; there she lurk'd \
alone; Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown: But, by the flames \
that cast their blaze around, That common bane of Greece and Troy I found. \
For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword; More dreads the vengeance of \
her injur'd lord; Ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd. Trembling with \
rage, the strumpet I regard, Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward: \
'Shall she triumphant sail before the wind, And leave in flames unhappy Troy \
behind? Shall she her kingdom and her friends review, In state attended with \
a captive crew, While unreveng'd the good old Priam falls, And Grecian fires \
consume the Trojan walls? For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood \
Were swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood? 'T is true, a soldier \
can small honor gain, And boast no conquest, from a woman slain: Yet shall \
the fact not pass without applause, Of vengeance taken in so just a cause; \
The punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease, And murm'ring manes of my \
friends appease.' Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light Spread o'er \
the place; and, shining heav'nly bright, My mother stood reveal'd before my \
sight Never so radiant did her eyes appear; Not her own star confess'd a \
light so clear: Great in her charms, as when on gods above She looks, and \
breathes herself into their love. She held my hand, the destin'd blow to \
break; Then from her rosy lips began to speak: 'My son, from whence this \
madness, this neglect Of my commands, and those whom I protect? Why this \
unmanly rage? Recall to mind Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind. \
Look if your helpless father yet survive, Or if Ascanius or Creusa live. \
Around your house the greedy Grecians err; And these had perish'd in the \
nightly war, But for my presence and protecting care. Not Helen's face, nor \
Paris, was in fault; But by the gods was this destruction brought. Now cast \
your eyes around, while I dissolve The mists and films that mortal eyes \
involve, Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see The shape of each \
avenging deity. Enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil, Nor fear obedience \
to your mother's will. Where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies, Stones rent \
from stones; where clouds of dust arise- Amid that smother Neptune holds his \
place, Below the wall's foundation drives his mace, And heaves the building \
from the solid base. Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands Full in the \
Scaean gate, with loud commands, Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands. \
See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud, Bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' \
the cloud: See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies, And arms against the \
town the partial deities. Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end: \
Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend: Haste; and a mother's \
care your passage shall befriend.' She said, and swiftly vanish'd from my \
sight, Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night. I look'd, I listen'd; \
dreadful sounds I hear; And the dire forms of hostile gods appear. Troy sunk \
in flames I saw (nor could prevent), And Ilium from its old foundations rent; \
Rent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds, And stood the sturdy strokes \
of lab'ring hinds. About the roots the cruel ax resounds; The stumps are \
pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds: The war is felt on high; the nodding crown \
Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down. To their united force \
it yields, tho' late, And mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate: The \
roots no more their upper load sustain; But down she falls, and spreads a \
ruin thro' the plain. \"Descending thence, I scape thro' foes and fire: \
Before the goddess, foes and flames retire. Arriv'd at home, he, for whose \
only sake, Or most for his, such toils I undertake, The good Anchises, whom, \
by timely flight, I purpos'd to secure on Ida's height, Refus'd the journey, \
resolute to die And add his fun'rals to the fate of Troy, Rather than exile \
and old age sustain. 'Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev'ry vein. Had Heav'n \
decreed that I should life enjoy, Heav'n had decreed to save unhappy Troy. 'T \
is, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, Twice to have seen our Ilium \
overthrown. Make haste to save the poor remaining crew, And give this useless \
corpse a long adieu. These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; At least \
the pitying foes will aid my death, To take my spoils, and leave my body \
bare: As for my sepulcher, let Heav'n take care. 'T is long since I, for my \
celestial wife Loath'd by the gods, have dragg'd a ling'ring life; Since \
ev'ry hour and moment I expire, Blasted from heav'n by Jove's avenging fire.' \
This oft repeated, he stood fix'd to die: Myself, my wife, my son, my family, \
Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry- 'What, will he still persist, on \
death resolve, And in his ruin all his house involve!' He still persists his \
reasons to maintain; Our pray'rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. \
\"Urg'd by despair, again I go to try The fate of arms, resolv'd in fight to \
die: 'What hope remains, but what my death must give? Can I, without so dear \
a father, live? You term it prudence, what I baseness call: Could such a word \
from such a parent fall? If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain, That \
nothing should of ruin'd Troy remain, And you conspire with Fortune to be \
slain, The way to death is wide, th' approaches near: For soon relentless \
Pyrrhus will appear, Reeking with Priam's blood- the wretch who slew The son \
(inhuman) in the father's view, And then the sire himself to the dire altar \
drew. O goddess mother, give me back to Fate; Your gift was undesir'd, and \
came too late! Did you, for this, unhappy me convey Thro' foes and fires, to \
see my house a prey? Shall I my father, wife, and son behold, Welt'ring in \
blood, each other's arms infold? Haste! gird my sword, tho' spent and \
overcome: 'T is the last summons to receive our doom. I hear thee, Fate; and \
I obey thy call! Not unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall. Restore me to the \
yet unfinish'd fight: My death is wanting to conclude the night.' Arm'd once \
again, my glitt'ring sword I wield, While th' other hand sustains my weighty \
shield, And forth I rush to seek th' abandon'd field. I went; but sad Creusa \
stopp'd my way, And cross the threshold in my passage lay, Embrac'd my knees, \
and, when I would have gone, Shew'd me my feeble sire and tender son: 'If \
death be your design, at least,' said she, 'Take us along to share your \
destiny. If any farther hopes in arms remain, This place, these pledges of \
your love, maintain. To whom do you expose your father's life, Your son's, \
and mine, your now forgotten wife!' While thus she fills the house with \
clam'rous cries, Our hearing is diverted by our eyes: For, while I held my \
son, in the short space Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace; Strange to \
relate, from young Iulus' head A lambent flame arose, which gently spread \
Around his brows, and on his temples fed. Amaz'd, with running water we \
prepare To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair; But old Anchises, \
vers'd in omens, rear'd His hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd: 'If \
any vows, almighty Jove, can bend Thy will; if piety can pray'rs commend, \
Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send.' Scarce had he said, \
when, on our left, we hear A peal of rattling thunder roll in air: There shot \
a streaming lamp along the sky, Which on the winged lightning seem'd to fly; \
From o'er the roof the blaze began to move, And, trailing, vanish'd in th' \
Idaean grove. It swept a path in heav'n, and shone a guide, Then in a \
steaming stench of sulphur died. \"The good old man with suppliant hands \
implor'd The gods' protection, and their star ador'd. 'Now, now,' said he, \
'my son, no more delay! I yield, I follow where Heav'n shews the way. Keep, O \
my country gods, our dwelling place, And guard this relic of the Trojan race, \
This tender child! These omens are your own, And you can yet restore the \
ruin'd town. At least accomplish what your signs foreshow: I stand resign'd, \
and am prepar'd to go.' \"He said. The crackling flames appear on high. And \
driving sparkles dance along the sky. With Vulcan's rage the rising winds \
conspire, And near our palace roll the flood of fire. 'Haste, my dear father, \
('t is no time to wait,) And load my shoulders with a willing freight. \
Whate'er befalls, your life shall be my care; One death, or one deliv'rance, \
we will share. My hand shall lead our little son; and you, My faithful \
consort, shall our steps pursue. Next, you, my servants, heed my strict \
commands: Without the walls a ruin'd temple stands, To Ceres hallow'd once; a \
cypress nigh Shoots up her venerable head on high, By long religion kept; \
there bend your feet, And in divided parties let us meet. Our country gods, \
the relics, and the bands, Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands: In \
me 't is impious holy things to bear, Red as I am with slaughter, new from \
war, Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt Of dire debate, and blood \
in battle spilt.' Thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide, I clothe my \
shoulders with a lion's hide And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back, The \
welcome load of my dear father take; While on my better hand Ascanius hung, \
And with unequal paces tripp'd along. Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray \
Thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way. I, who so bold and dauntless, just \
before, The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore, At ev'ry shadow now am \
seiz'd with fear, Not for myself, but for the charge I bear; Till, near the \
ruin'd gate arriv'd at last, Secure, and deeming all the danger past, A \
frightful noise of trampling feet we hear. My father, looking thro' the \
shades, with fear, Cried out: 'Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh; Their \
swords and shining armor I descry.' Some hostile god, for some unknown \
offense, Had sure bereft my mind of better sense; For, while thro' winding \
ways I took my flight, And sought the shelter of the gloomy night, Alas! I \
lost Creusa: hard to tell If by her fatal destiny she fell, Or weary sate, or \
wander'd with affright; But she was lost for ever to my sight. I knew not, or \
reflected, till I meet My friends, at Ceres' now deserted seat. We met: not \
one was wanting; only she Deceiv'd her friends, her son, and wretched me. \
\"What mad expressions did my tongue refuse! Whom did I not, of gods or men, \
accuse! This was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more Than all I felt from \
ruin'd Troy before. Stung with my loss, and raving with despair, Abandoning \
my now forgotten care, Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft, My sire, my \
son, my country gods I left. In shining armor once again I sheathe My limbs, \
not feeling wounds, nor fearing death. Then headlong to the burning walls I \
run, And seek the danger I was forc'd to shun. I tread my former tracks; \
thro' night explore Each passage, ev'ry street I cross'd before. All things \
were full of horror and affright, And dreadful ev'n the silence of the night. \
Then to my father's house I make repair, With some small glimpse of hope to \
find her there. Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met; The house was fill'd \
with foes, with flames beset. Driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of \
fire, Thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire. From thence to Priam's \
palace I resort, And search the citadel and desart court. Then, unobserv'd, I \
pass by Juno's church: A guard of Grecians had possess'd the porch; There \
Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey, And thither all the wealth of Troy convey: \
The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought, And golden bowls from \
burning altars caught, The tables of the gods, the purple vests, The people's \
treasure, and the pomp of priests. A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd \
hands, And captive matrons, in long order stands. Then, with ungovern'd \
madness, I proclaim, Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name: Creusa still \
I call; at length she hears, And sudden thro' the shades of night appears- \
Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife, But a pale specter, larger than the \
life. Aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear, I stood; like bristles \
rose my stiffen'd hair. Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief 'Nor \
tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief. Desist, my much-lov'd lord,'t \
indulge your pain; You bear no more than what the gods ordain. My fates \
permit me not from hence to fly; Nor he, the great controller of the sky. \
Long wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree; On land hard labors, and a \
length of sea. Then, after many painful years are past, On Latium's happy \
shore you shall be cast, Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds The flow'ry \
meadows, and the feeding folds. There end your toils; and there your fates \
provide A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride: There fortune shall the Trojan \
line restore, And you for lost Creusa weep no more. Fear not that I shall \
watch, with servile shame, Th' imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame; \
Or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace My goddess mother, or my royal \
race. And now, farewell! The parent of the gods Restrains my fleeting soul in \
her abodes: I trust our common issue to your care.' She said, and gliding \
pass'd unseen in air. I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue; And \
thrice about her neck my arms I flung, And, thrice deceiv'd, on vain embraces \
hung. Light as an empty dream at break of day, Or as a blast of wind, she \
rush'd away. \"Thus having pass'd the night in fruitless pain, I to my \
longing friends return again, Amaz'd th' augmented number to behold, Of men \
and matrons mix'd, of young and old; A wretched exil'd crew together brought, \
With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught, Resolv'd, and willing, under \
my command, To run all hazards both of sea and land. The Morn began, from \
Ida, to display Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day: Before the gates \
the Grecians took their post, And all pretense of late relief was lost. I \
yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.\" \
BOOK III \"When Heav'n had overturn'd the Trojan state And Priam's throne, by \
too severe a fate; When ruin'd Troy became the Grecians' prey, And Ilium's \
lofty tow'rs in ashes lay; Warn'd by celestial omens, we retreat, To seek in \
foreign lands a happier seat. Near old Antandros, and at Ida's foot, The \
timber of the sacred groves we cut, And build our fleet; uncertain yet to \
find What place the gods for our repose assign'd. Friends daily flock; and \
scarce the kindly spring Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, When \
old Anchises summon'd all to sea: The crew my father and the Fates obey. With \
sighs and tears I leave my native shore, And empty fields, where Ilium stood \
before. My sire, my son, our less and greater gods, All sail at once, and \
cleave the briny floods. \"Against our coast appears a spacious land, Which \
once the fierce Lycurgus did command, (Thracia the name- the people bold in \
war; Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,) A hospitable realm \
while Fate was kind, With Troy in friendship and religion join'd. I land; \
with luckless omens then adore Their gods, and draw a line along the shore; I \
lay the deep foundations of a wall, And Aenos, nam'd from me, the city call. \
To Dionaean Venus vows are paid, And all the pow'rs that rising labors aid; A \
bull on Jove's imperial altar laid. Not far, a rising hillock stood in view; \
Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew. There, while I went to crop the \
sylvan scenes, And shade our altar with their leafy greens, I pull'd a plant- \
with horror I relate A prodigy so strange and full of fate. The rooted fibers \
rose, and from the wound Black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground. Mute \
and amaz'd, my hair with terror stood; Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal'd \
my blood. Mann'd once again, another plant I try: That other gush'd with the \
same sanguine dye. Then, fearing guilt for some offense unknown, With pray'rs \
and vows the Dryads I atone, With all the sisters of the woods, and most The \
God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast, That they, or he, these omens \
would avert, Release our fears, and better signs impart. Clear'd, as I \
thought, and fully fix'd at length To learn the cause, I tugged with all my \
strength: I bent my knees against the ground; once more The violated myrtle \
ran with gore. Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb Of wounded earth, \
and caverns of the tomb, A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd My fright, \
and then these dreadful words ensued: 'Why dost thou thus my buried body \
rend? O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend! Spare to pollute thy pious \
hands with blood: The tears distil not from the wounded wood; But ev'ry drop \
this living tree contains Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins. O fly \
from this unhospitable shore, Warn'd by my fate; for I am Polydore! Here \
loads of lances, in my blood embrued, Again shoot upward, by my blood \
renew'd.' \"My falt'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare My horror, and in \
bristles rose my hair. When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent, Old \
Priam, fearful of the war's event, This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent: \
Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far From noise and tumults, and \
destructive war, Committed to the faithless tyrant's care; Who, when he saw \
the pow'r of Troy decline, Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join; Broke \
ev'ry bond of nature and of truth, And murder'd, for his wealth, the royal \
youth. O sacred hunger of pernicious gold! What bands of faith can impious \
lucre hold? Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears, I call my father and \
the Trojan peers; Relate the prodigies of Heav'n, require What he commands, \
and their advice desire. All vote to leave that execrable shore, Polluted \
with the blood of Polydore; But, ere we sail, his fun'ral rites prepare, \
Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear. In mournful pomp the matrons walk \
the round, With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd, With eyes dejected, \
and with hair unbound. Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour, And thrice \
invoke the soul of Polydore. \"Now, when the raging storms no longer reign, \
But southern gales invite us to the main, We launch our vessels, with a \
prosp'rous wind, And leave the cities and the shores behind. \"An island in \
th' Aegaean main appears; Neptune and wat'ry Doris claim it theirs. It \
floated once, till Phoebus fix'd the sides To rooted earth, and now it braves \
the tides. Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore, With needful ease \
our weary limbs restore, And the Sun's temple and his town adore. \"Anius, \
the priest and king, with laurel crown'd, His hoary locks with purple fillets \
bound, Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend, Came forth with eager haste \
to meet his friend; Invites him to his palace; and, in sign Of ancient love, \
their plighted hands they join. Then to the temple of the god I went, And \
thus, before the shrine, my vows present: 'Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting \
place To the sad relics of the Trojan race; A seat secure, a region of their \
own, A lasting empire, and a happier town. Where shall we fix? where shall \
our labors end? Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend? Let not my \
pray'rs a doubtful answer find; But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.' \
Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground, The laurels, and the lofty hills \
around; And from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound. Prostrate we fell; \
confess'd the present god, Who gave this answer from his dark abode: \
'Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth From which your ancestors \
derive their birth. The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race In her old \
bosom shall again embrace. Thro' the wide world th' Aeneian house shall \
reign, And children's children shall the crown sustain.' Thus Phoebus did our \
future fates disclose: A mighty tumult, mix'd with joy, arose. \"All are \
concern'd to know what place the god Assign'd, and where determin'd our \
abode. My father, long revolving in his mind The race and lineage of the \
Trojan kind, Thus answer'd their demands: 'Ye princes, hear Your pleasing \
fortune, and dispel your fear. The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to \
fame, Sacred of old to Jove's imperial name, In the mid ocean lies, with \
large command, And on its plains a hundred cities stand. Another Ida rises \
there, and we From thence derive our Trojan ancestry. From thence, as 't is \
divulg'd by certain fame, To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came; There \
fix'd, and there the seat of empire chose, Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow'rs \
arose. In humble vales they built their soft abodes, Till Cybele, the mother \
of the gods, With tinkling cymbals charm'd th' Idaean woods, She secret rites \
and ceremonies taught, And to the yoke the savage lions brought. Let us the \
land which Heav'n appoints, explore; Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian \
shore. If Jove assists the passage of our fleet, The third propitious dawn \
discovers Crete.' Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid On smoking altars, \
to the gods he paid: A bull, to Neptune an oblation due, Another bull to \
bright Apollo slew; A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please, And one \
coal-black, to calm the stormy seas. Ere this, a flying rumor had been spread \
That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled, Expell'd and exil'd; that the \
coast was free From foreign or domestic enemy. \"We leave the Delian ports, \
and put to sea; By Naxos, fam'd for vintage, make our way; Then green Donysa \
pass; and sail in sight Of Paros' isle, with marble quarries white. We pass \
the scatter'd isles of Cyclades, That, scarce distinguish'd, seem to stud the \
seas. The shouts of sailors double near the shores; They stretch their \
canvas, and they ply their oars. 'All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!' \
they cry, And swiftly thro' the foamy billows fly. Full on the promis'd land \
at length we bore, With joy descending on the Cretan shore. With eager haste \
a rising town I frame, Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name: The name itself \
was grateful; I exhort To found their houses, and erect a fort. Our ships are \
haul'd upon the yellow strand; The youth begin to till the labor'd land; And \
I myself new marriages promote, Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot; \
When rising vapors choke the wholesome air, And blasts of noisome winds \
corrupt the year; The trees devouring caterpillars burn; Parch'd was the \
grass, and blighted was the corn: Nor 'scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on \
high, With pestilential heat infects the sky: My men- some fall, the rest in \
fevers fry. Again my father bids me seek the shore Of sacred Delos, and the \
god implore, To learn what end of woes we might expect, And to what clime our \
weary course direct. \"'T was night, when ev'ry creature, void of cares, The \
common gift of balmy slumber shares: The statues of my gods (for such they \
seem'd), Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem'd, Before me stood, \
majestically bright, Full in the beams of Phoebe's ent'ring light. Then thus \
they spoke, and eas'd my troubled mind: 'What from the Delian god thou go'st \
to find, He tells thee here, and sends us to relate. Those pow'rs are we, \
companions of thy fate, Who from the burning town by thee were brought, Thy \
fortune follow'd, and thy safety wrought. Thro' seas and lands as we thy \
steps attend, So shall our care thy glorious race befriend. An ample realm \
for thee thy fates ordain, A town that o'er the conquer'd world shall reign. \
Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build; Nor let thy weary mind to labors \
yield: But change thy seat; for not the Delian god, Nor we, have giv'n thee \
Crete for our abode. A land there is, Hesperia call'd of old, (The soil is \
fruitful, and the natives bold- Th' Oenotrians held it once,) by later fame \
Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name. lasius there and Dardanus were \
born; From thence we came, and thither must return. Rise, and thy sire with \
these glad tidings greet. Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.' \
\"Astonish'd at their voices and their sight, (Nor were they dreams, but \
visions of the night; I saw, I knew their faces, and descried, In perfect \
view, their hair with fillets tied;) I started from my couch; a clammy sweat \
On all my limbs and shiv'ring body sate. To heav'n I lift my hands with pious \
haste, And sacred incense in the flames I cast. Thus to the gods their \
perfect honors done, More cheerful, to my good old sire I run, And tell the \
pleasing news. In little space He found his error of the double race; Not, as \
before he deem'd, deriv'd from Crete; No more deluded by the doubtful seat: \
Then said: 'O son, turmoil'd in Trojan fate! Such things as these Cassandra \
did relate. This day revives within my mind what she Foretold of Troy renew'd \
in Italy, And Latian lands; but who could then have thought That Phrygian \
gods to Latium should be brought, Or who believ'd what mad Cassandra taught? \
Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.' \"He said; and we with glad \
consent obey, Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, We spread our sails \
before the willing wind. Now from the sight of land our galleys move, With \
only seas around and skies above; When o'er our heads descends a burst of \
rain, And night with sable clouds involves the main; The ruffling winds the \
foamy billows raise; The scatter'd fleet is forc'd to sev'ral ways; The face \
of heav'n is ravish'd from our eyes, And in redoubled peals the roaring \
thunder flies. Cast from our course, we wander in the dark. No stars to \
guide, no point of land to mark. Ev'n Palinurus no distinction found Betwixt \
the night and day; such darkness reign'd around. Three starless nights the \
doubtful navy strays, Without distinction, and three sunless days; The fourth \
renews the light, and, from our shrouds, We view a rising land, like distant \
clouds; The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight, And curling smoke \
ascending from their height. The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply; \
From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly. At length I land upon the \
Strophades, Safe from the danger of the stormy seas. Those isles are \
compass'd by th' Ionian main, The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign, \
Forc'd by the winged warriors to repair To their old homes, and leave their \
costly fare. Monsters more fierce offended Heav'n ne'er sent From hell's \
abyss, for human punishment: With virgin faces, but with wombs obscene, Foul \
paunches, and with ordure still unclean; With claws for hands, and looks for \
ever lean. \"We landed at the port, and soon beheld Fat herds of oxen graze \
the flow'ry field, And wanton goats without a keeper stray'd. With weapons we \
the welcome prey invade, Then call the gods for partners of our feast, And \
Jove himself, the chief invited guest. We spread the tables on the greensward \
ground; We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round; When from the \
mountain-tops, with hideous cry, And clatt'ring wings, the hungry Harpies \
fly; They snatch the meat, defiling all they find, And, parting, leave a \
loathsome stench behind. Close by a hollow rock, again we sit, New dress the \
dinner, and the beds refit, Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade, \
Where tufted trees a native arbor made. Again the holy fires on altars burn; \
And once again the rav'nous birds return, Or from the dark recesses where \
they lie, Or from another quarter of the sky; With filthy claws their odious \
meal repeat, And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat. I bid my \
friends for vengeance then prepare, And with the hellish nation wage the war. \
They, as commanded, for the fight provide, And in the grass their glitt'ring \
weapons hide; Then, when along the crooked shore we hear Their clatt'ring \
wings, and saw the foes appear, Misenus sounds a charge: we take th' alarm, \
And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm. In this new kind of combat \
all employ Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy. In vain- the fated \
skin is proof to wounds; And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds. At \
length rebuff'd, they leave their mangled prey, And their stretch'd pinions \
to the skies display. Yet one remain'd- the messenger of Fate: High on a \
craggy cliff Celaeno sate, And thus her dismal errand did relate: 'What! not \
contented with our oxen slain, Dare you with Heav'n an impious war maintain, \
And drive the Harpies from their native reign? Heed therefore what I say; and \
keep in mind What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design'd, And I, the Furies' \
queen, from both relate- You seek th' Italian shores, foredoom'd by fate: Th' \
Italian shores are granted you to find, And a safe passage to the port \
assign'd. But know, that ere your promis'd walls you build, My curses shall \
severely be fulfill'd. Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed, Reduc'd to \
grind the plates on which you feed.' She said, and to the neighb'ring forest \
flew. Our courage fails us, and our fears renew. Hopeless to win by war, to \
pray'rs we fall, And on th' offended Harpies humbly call, And whether gods or \
birds obscene they were, Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer. But old \
Anchises, off'ring sacrifice, And lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes, \
Ador'd the greater gods: 'Avert,' said he, 'These omens; render vain this \
prophecy, And from th' impending curse a pious people free!' \"Thus having \
said, he bids us put to sea; We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey, And \
soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way. Amidst our course, Zacynthian \
woods appear; And next by rocky Neritos we steer: We fly from Ithaca's \
detested shore, And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore. At length \
Leucate's cloudy top appears, And the Sun's temple, which the sailor fears. \
Resolv'd to breathe a while from labor past, Our crooked anchors from the \
prow we cast, And joyful to the little city haste. Here, safe beyond our \
hopes, our vows we pay To Jove, the guide and patron of our way. The customs \
of our country we pursue, And Trojan games on Actian shores renew. Our youth \
their naked limbs besmear with oil, And exercise the wrastlers' noble toil; \
Pleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind, And left so many Grecian \
towns behind. The sun had now fulfill'd his annual course, And Boreas on the \
seas display'd his force: I fix'd upon the temple's lofty door The brazen \
shield which vanquish'd Abas bore; The verse beneath my name and action \
speaks: 'These arms Aeneas took from conqu'ring Greeks.' Then I command to \
weigh; the seamen ply Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly. The sight \
of high Phaeacia soon we lost, And skimm'd along Epirus' rocky coast. \"Then \
to Chaonia's port our course we bend, And, landed, to Buthrotus' heights \
ascend. Here wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame: How Helenus reviv'd the \
Trojan name, And reign'd in Greece; that Priam's captive son Succeeded \
Pyrrhus in his bed and throne; And fair Andromache, restor'd by fate, Once \
more was happy in a Trojan mate. I leave my galleys riding in the port, And \
long to see the new Dardanian court. By chance, the mournful queen, before \
the gate, Then solemniz'd her former husband's fate. Green altars, rais'd of \
turf, with gifts she crown'd, And sacred priests in order stand around, And \
thrice the name of hapless Hector sound. The grove itself resembles Ida's \
wood; And Simois seem'd the well-dissembled flood. But when at nearer \
distance she beheld My shining armor and my Trojan shield, Astonish'd at the \
sight, the vital heat Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat: She \
faints, she falls, and scarce recov'ring strength, Thus, with a falt'ring \
tongue, she speaks at length: \"'Are you alive, O goddess-born ?' she said, \
'Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?' At this, she cast a loud and \
frightful cry. With broken words I made this brief reply: 'All of me that \
remains appears in sight; I live, if living be to loathe the light. No \
phantom; but I drag a wretched life, My fate resembling that of Hector's \
wife. What have you suffer'd since you lost your lord? By what strange \
blessing are you now restor'd? Still are you Hector's? or is Hector fled, And \
his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus' bed?' With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone, \
After a modest pause she thus begun: \"'O only happy maid of Priam's race, \
Whom death deliver'd from the foes' embrace! Commanded on Achilles' tomb to \
die, Not forc'd, like us, to hard captivity, Or in a haughty master's arms to \
lie. In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne, Endur'd the victor's lust, \
sustain'd the scorn: Thus I submitted to the lawless pride Of Pyrrhus, more a \
handmaid than a bride. Cloy'd with possession, he forsook my bed, And Helen's \
lovely daughter sought to wed; Then me to Trojan Helenus resign'd, And his \
two slaves in equal marriage join'd; Till young Orestes, pierc'd with deep \
despair, And longing to redeem the promis'd fair, Before Apollo's altar slew \
the ravisher. By Pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regain'd: At least one half \
with Helenus remain'd. Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls, And names from \
Pergamus his rising walls. But you, what fates have landed on our coast? What \
gods have sent you, or what storms have toss'd? Does young Ascanius life and \
health enjoy, Sav'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy? O tell me how his \
mother's loss he bears, What hopes are promis'd from his blooming years, How \
much of Hector in his face appears?' She spoke; and mix'd her speech with \
mournful cries, And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes. \"At length \
her lord descends upon the plain, In pomp, attended with a num'rous train; \
Receives his friends, and to the city leads, And tears of joy amidst his \
welcome sheds. Proceeding on, another Troy I see, Or, in less compass, Troy's \
epitome. A riv'let by the name of Xanthus ran, And I embrace the Scaean gate \
again. My friends in porticoes were entertain'd, And feasts and pleasures \
thro' the city reign'd. The tables fill'd the spacious hall around, And \
golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd. Two days we pass'd in mirth, \
till friendly gales, Blown from the supplied our swelling sails. Then to the \
royal seer I thus began: 'O thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of man, The \
laws of heav'n, and what the stars decree; Whom Phoebus taught unerring \
prophecy, From his own tripod, and his holy tree; Skill'd in the wing'd \
inhabitants of air, What auspices their notes and flights declare: O say- for \
all religious rites portend A happy voyage, and a prosp'rous end; And ev'ry \
power and omen of the sky Direct my course for destin'd Italy; But only dire \
Celaeno, from the gods, A dismal famine fatally forebodes- O say what dangers \
I am first to shun, What toils vanquish, and what course to run.' \"The \
prophet first with sacrifice adores The greater gods; their pardon then \
implores; Unbinds the fillet from his holy head; To Phoebus, next, my \
trembling steps he led, Full of religious doubts and awful dread. Then, with \
his god possess'd, before the shrine, These words proceeded from his mouth \
divine: 'O goddess-born, (for Heav'n's appointed will, With greater auspices \
of good than ill, Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs; Thy fates \
conspire, and Jove himself protects,) Of many things some few I shall \
explain, Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main, And how at length the \
promis'd shore to gain. The rest the fates from Helenus conceal, And Juno's \
angry pow'r forbids to tell. First, then, that happy shore, that seems so \
nigh, Will far from your deluded wishes fly; Long tracts of seas divide your \
hopes from Italy: For you must cruise along Sicilian shores, And stem the \
currents with your struggling oars; Then round th' Italian coast your navy \
steer; And, after this, to Circe's island veer; And, last, before your new \
foundations rise, Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies. Now \
mark the signs of future ease and rest, And bear them safely treasur'd in thy \
breast. When, in the shady shelter of a wood, And near the margin of a gentle \
flood, Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground, With thirty sucking young \
encompass'd round; The dam and offspring white as falling snow- These on thy \
city shall their name bestow, And there shall end thy labors and thy woe. Nor \
let the threaten'd famine fright thy mind, For Phoebus will assist, and Fate \
the way will find. Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent, Which fronts \
from far th' Epirian continent: Those parts are all by Grecian foes \
possess'd; The salvage Locrians here the shores infest; There fierce \
Idomeneus his city builds, And guards with arms the Salentinian fields; And \
on the mountain's brow Petilia stands, Which Philoctetes with his troops \
commands. Ev'n when thy fleet is landed on the shore, And priests with holy \
vows the gods adore, Then with a purple veil involve your eyes, Lest hostile \
faces blast the sacrifice. These rites and customs to the rest commend, That \
to your pious race they may descend. \"'When, parted hence, the wind, that \
ready waits For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits Where proud Pelorus \
opes a wider way, Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea: Veer starboard \
sea and land. Th' Italian shore And fair Sicilia's coast were one, before An \
earthquake caus'd the flaw: the roaring tides The passage broke that land \
from land divides; And where the lands retir'd, the rushing ocean rides. \
Distinguish'd by the straits, on either hand, Now rising cities in long order \
stand, And fruitful fields: so much can time invade The mold'ring work that \
beauteous Nature made. Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides: \
Charybdis roaring on the left presides, And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the \
tides; Then spouts them from below: with fury driv'n, The waves mount up and \
wash the face of heav'n. But Scylla from her den, with open jaws, The sinking \
vessel in her eddy draws, Then dashes on the rocks. A human face, And virgin \
bosom, hides her tail's disgrace: Her parts obscene below the waves descend, \
With dogs inclos'd, and in a dolphin end. 'T is safer, then, to bear aloof to \
sea, And coast Pachynus, tho' with more delay, Than once to view misshapen \
Scylla near, And the loud yell of wat'ry wolves to hear. \"'Besides, if faith \
to Helenus be due, And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true, Do not this precept \
of your friend forget, Which therefore more than once I must repeat: Above \
the rest, great Juno's name adore; Pay vows to Juno; Juno's aid implore. Let \
gifts be to the mighty queen design'd, And mollify with pray'rs her haughty \
mind. Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free, And you shall safe \
descend on Italy. Arriv'd at Cumae, when you view the flood Of black Avernus, \
and the sounding wood, The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find, Dark in a \
cave, and on a rock reclin'd. She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits, \
The notes and names, inscrib'd, to leafs commits. What she commits to leafs, \
in order laid, Before the cavern's entrance are display'd: Unmov'd they lie; \
but, if a blast of wind Without, or vapors issue from behind, The leafs are \
borne aloft in liquid air, And she resumes no more her museful care, Nor \
gathers from the rocks her scatter'd verse, Nor sets in order what the winds \
disperse. Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid The madness of the \
visionary maid, And with loud curses leave the mystic shade. \"'Think it not \
loss of time a while to stay, Tho' thy companions chide thy long delay; Tho' \
summon'd to the seas, tho' pleasing gales Invite thy course, and stretch thy \
swelling sails: But beg the sacred priestess to relate With willing words, \
and not to write thy fate. The fierce Italian people she will show, And all \
thy wars, and all thy future woe, And what thou may'st avoid, and what must \
undergo. She shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind, And teach thee how \
the happy shores to find. This is what Heav'n allows me to relate: Now part \
in peace; pursue thy better fate, And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan \
state.' \"This when the priest with friendly voice declar'd, He gave me \
license, and rich gifts prepar'd: Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want \
With heavy gold, and polish'd elephant; Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board, \
And ev'ry ship with sums of silver stor'd. A trusty coat of mail to me he \
sent, Thrice chain'd with gold, for use and ornament; The helm of Pyrrhus \
added to the rest, That flourish'd with a plume and waving crest. Nor was my \
sire forgotten, nor my friends; And large recruits he to my navy sends: Men, \
horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores; Supplies new pilots, and new \
sweeping oars. Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails, Lest we should \
lose the first auspicious gales. \"The prophet bless'd the parting crew, and \
last, With words like these, his ancient friend embrac'd: 'Old happy man, the \
care of gods above, Whom heav'nly Venus honor'd with her love, And twice \
preserv'd thy life, when Troy was lost, Behold from far the wish'd Ausonian \
coast: There land; but take a larger compass round, For that before is all \
forbidden ground. The shore that Phoebus has design'd for you, At farther \
distance lies, conceal'd from view. Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes, \
Blest in a son, and favor'd by the gods: For I with useless words prolong \
your stay, When southern gales have summon'd you away.' \"Nor less the queen \
our parting thence deplor'd, Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord. A \
noble present to my son she brought, A robe with flow'rs on golden tissue \
wrought, A phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside Of precious texture, \
and of Asian pride. 'Accept,' she said, 'these monuments of love, Which in my \
youth with happier hands I wove: Regard these trifles for the giver's sake; \
'T is the last present Hector's wife can make. Thou call'st my lost Astyanax \
to mind; In thee his features and his form I find: His eyes so sparkled with \
a lively flame; Such were his motions; such was all his frame; And ah! had \
Heav'n so pleas'd, his years had been the same.' \"With tears I took my last \
adieu, and said: 'Your fortune, happy pair, already made, Leaves you no \
farther wish. My diff'rent state, Avoiding one, incurs another fate. To you a \
quiet seat the gods allow: You have no shores to search, no seas to plow, Nor \
fields of flying Italy to chase: (Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!) You \
see another Simois, and enjoy The labor of your hands, another Troy, With \
better auspice than her ancient tow'rs, And less obnoxious to the Grecian \
pow'rs. If e'er the gods, whom I with vows adore, Conduct my steps to Tiber's \
happy shore; If ever I ascend the Latian throne, And build a city I may call \
my own; As both of us our birth from Troy derive, So let our kindred lines in \
concord live, And both in acts of equal friendship strive. Our fortunes, good \
or bad, shall be the same: The double Troy shall differ but in name; That \
what we now begin may never end, But long to late posterity descend.' \"Near \
the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore; The shortest passage to th' Italian \
shore. Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light, And hills were hid in \
dusky shades of night: We land, and, on the bosom Of the ground, A safe \
retreat and a bare lodging found. Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep \
Their watches, and the rest securely sleep. The night, proceeding on with \
silent pace, Stood in her noon, and view'd with equal face Her steepy rise \
and her declining race. Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy The face of \
heav'n, and the nocturnal sky; And listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try; \
Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course, The Pleiads, Hyads, and \
their wat'ry force; And both the Bears is careful to behold, And bright \
Orion, arm'd with burnish'd gold. Then, when he saw no threat'ning tempest \
nigh, But a sure promise of a settled sky, He gave the sign to weigh; we \
break our sleep, Forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep. \"And now the \
rising morn with rosy light Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight; \
When we from far, like bluish mists, descry The hills, and then the plains, \
of Italy. Achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound; Then, 'Italy!' the \
cheerful crew rebound. My sire Anchises crown'd a cup with wine, And, \
off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine: 'Ye gods, presiding over lands and \
seas, And you who raging winds and waves appease, Breathe on our swelling \
sails a prosp'rous wind, And smooth our passage to the port assign'd!' The \
gentle gales their flagging force renew, And now the happy harbor is in view. \
Minerva's temple then salutes our sight, Plac'd, as a landmark, on the \
mountain's height. We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore; The \
curling waters round the galleys roar. The land lies open to the raging east, \
Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd, Shuts out the storms; the \
winds and waves complain, And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain. The \
port lies hid within; on either side Two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth \
divide. The temple, which aloft we view'd before, To distance flies, and \
seems to shun the shore. Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld Were four \
white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field. 'War, war is threaten'd from \
this foreign ground,' My father cried, 'where warlike steeds are found. Yet, \
since reclaim'd to chariots they submit, And bend to stubborn yokes, and \
champ the bit, Peace may succeed to war.' Our way we bend To Pallas, and the \
sacred hill ascend; There prostrate to the fierce virago pray, Whose temple \
was the landmark of our way. Each with a Phrygian mantle veil'd his head, And \
all commands of Helenus obey'd, And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid. These \
dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and stand To sea, forsaking that \
suspected land. \"From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view, For Hercules \
renown'd, if fame be true. Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands; Caulonian \
tow'rs, and Scylacaean strands, For shipwrecks fear'd. Mount Aetna thence we \
spy, Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky. Far off we hear the waves \
with surly sound Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound. The \
billows break upon the sounding strand, And roll the rising tide, impure with \
sand. Then thus Anchises, in experience old: ''T is that Charybdis which the \
seer foretold, And those the promis'd rocks! Bear off to sea!' With haste the \
frighted mariners obey. First Palinurus to the larboard veer'd; Then all the \
fleet by his example steer'd. To heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride, Then \
down to hell descend, when they divide; And thrice our galleys knock'd the \
stony ground, And thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound, And thrice we \
saw the stars, that stood with dews around. The flagging winds forsook us, \
with the sun; And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run. The port capacious, \
and secure from wind, Is to the foot of thund'ring Aetna join'd. By turns a \
pitchy cloud she rolls on high; By turns hot embers from her entrails fly, \
And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky. Oft from her bowels massy \
rocks are thrown, And, shiver'd by the force, come piecemeal down. Oft liquid \
lakes of burning sulphur flow, Fed from the fiery springs that boil below. \
Enceladus, they say, transfix'd by Jove, With blasted limbs came tumbling \
from above; And, where he fell, th' avenging father drew This flaming hill, \
and on his body threw. As often as he turns his weary sides, He shakes the \
solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides. In shady woods we pass the tedious \
night, Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright, Of which no \
cause is offer'd to the sight; For not one star was kindled in the sky, Nor \
could the moon her borrow'd light supply; For misty clouds involv'd the \
firmament, The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent. \"Scarce had the \
rising sun the day reveal'd, Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell'd, \
When from the woods there bolts, before our sight, Somewhat betwixt a mortal \
and a sprite, So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan, So bare of flesh, he \
scarce resembled man. This thing, all tatter'd, seem'd from far t' implore \
Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore. We look behind, then view his shaggy \
beard; His clothes were tagg'd with thorns, and filth his limbs besmear'd; \
The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face, Appear'd a Greek, and such indeed \
he was. He cast on us, from far, a frightful view, Whom soon for Trojans and \
for foes he knew; Stood still, and paus'd; then all at once began To stretch \
his limbs, and trembled as he ran. Soon as approach'd, upon his knees he \
falls, And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls: 'Now, by the pow'rs \
above, and what we share From Nature's common gift, this vital air, O \
Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more; But bear me far from this unhappy \
shore. 'T is true, I am a Greek, and farther own, Among your foes besieg'd \
th' imperial town. For such demerits if my death be due, No more for this \
abandon'd life I sue; This only favor let my tears obtain, To throw me \
headlong in the rapid main: Since nothing more than death my crime demands, I \
die content, to die by human hands.' He said, and on his knees my knees \
embrac'd: I bade him boldly tell his fortune past, His present state, his \
lineage, and his name, Th' occasion of his fears, and whence he came. The \
good Anchises rais'd him with his hand; Who, thus encourag'd, answer'd our \
demand: 'From Ithaca, my native soil, I came To Troy; and Achaemenides my \
name. Me my poor father with Ulysses sent; (O had I stay'd, with poverty \
content!) But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen Left me forsaken in the \
Cyclops' den. The cave, tho' large, was dark; the dismal floor Was pav'd with \
mangled limbs and putrid gore. Our monstrous host, of more than human size, \
Erects his head, and stares within the skies; Bellowing his voice, and horrid \
is his hue. Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view! The joints of \
slaughter'd wretches are his food; And for his wine he quaffs the streaming \
blood. These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand He seiz'd two captives \
of our Grecian band; Stretch'd on his back, he dash'd against the stones \
Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones: With spouting blood the \
purple pavement swims, While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs. \
\"'Not unreveng'd Ulysses bore their fate, Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy \
state; For, gorg'd with flesh, and drunk with human wine While fast asleep \
the giant lay supine, Snoring aloud, and belching from his maw His indigested \
foam, and morsels raw; We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround The \
monstrous body, stretch'd along the ground: Each, as he could approach him, \
lends a hand To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand. Beneath his frowning \
forehead lay his eye; For only one did the vast frame supply- But that a \
globe so large, his front it fill'd, Like the sun's disk or like a Grecian \
shield. The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends: This vengeance \
follow'd for our slaughter'd friends. But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to \
fly! Your cables cut, and on your oars rely! Such, and so vast as Polypheme \
appears, A hundred more this hated island bears: Like him, in caves they shut \
their woolly sheep; Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep; Like \
him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep And now three moons \
their sharpen'd horns renew, Since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from \
view, I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright, And in deserted caverns \
lodge by night; Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see Of the huge \
Cyclops, like a walking tree: From far I hear his thund'ring voice resound, \
And trampling feet that shake the solid ground. Cornels and salvage berries \
of the wood, And roots and herbs, have been my meager food. While all around \
my longing eyes I cast, I saw your happy ships appear at last. On those I \
fix'd my hopes, to these I run; 'T is all I ask, this cruel race to shun; \
What other death you please, yourselves bestow.' \"Scarce had he said, when \
on the mountain's brow We saw the giant shepherd stalk before His following \
flock, and leading to the shore: A monstrous bulk, deform'd, depriv'd of \
sight; His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright. His pond'rous \
whistle from his neck descends; His woolly care their pensive lord attends: \
This only solace his hard fortune sends. Soon as he reach'd the shore and \
touch'd the waves, From his bor'd eye the gutt'ring blood he laves: He \
gnash'd his teeth, and groan'd; thro' seas he strides, And scarce the topmost \
billows touch'd his sides. \"Seiz'd with a sudden fear, we run to sea, The \
cables cut, and silent haste away; The well-deserving stranger entertain; \
Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main. The giant harken'd to \
the dashing sound: But, when our vessels out of reach he found, He strided \
onward, and in vain essay'd Th' Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade. With \
that he roar'd aloud: the dreadful cry Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the \
billows fly Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy. The neigh'ring Aetna \
trembling all around, The winding caverns echo to the sound. His brother \
Cyclops hear the yelling roar, And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the \
shore. We saw their stern distorted looks, from far, And one-eyed glance, \
that vainly threaten'd war: A dreadful council, with their heads on high; \
(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;) Not yielding to the tow'ring \
tree of Jove, Or tallest cypress of Diana's grove. New pangs of mortal fear \
our minds assail; We tug at ev'ry oar, and hoist up ev'ry sail, And take th' \
advantage of the friendly gale. Forewarn'd by Helenus, we strive to shun \
Charybdis' gulf, nor dare to Scylla run. An equal fate on either side \
appears: We, tacking to the left, are free from fears; For, from Pelorus' \
point, the North arose, And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows. His \
rocky mouth we pass, and make our way By Thapsus and Megara's winding bay. \
This passage Achaemenides had shown, Tracing the course which he before had \
run. \"Right o'er against Plemmyrium's wat'ry strand, There lies an isle once \
call'd th' Ortygian land. Alpheus, as old fame reports, has found From Greece \
a secret passage under ground, By love to beauteous Arethusa led; And, \
mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed. As Helenus enjoin'd, we next \
adore Diana's name, protectress of the shore. With prosp'rous gales we pass \
the quiet sounds Of still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds. Then, doubling \
Cape Pachynus, we survey The rocky shore extended to the sea. The town of \
Camarine from far we see, And fenny lake, undrain'd by fate's decree. In \
sight of the Geloan fields we pass, And the large walls, where mighty Gela \
was; Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown'd, Long for the race of warlike \
steeds renown'd. We pass'd Selinus, and the palmy land, And widely shun the \
Lilybaean strand, Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand. At length on \
shore the weary fleet arriv'd, Which Drepanum's unhappy port receiv'd. Here, \
after endless labors, often toss'd By raging storms, and driv'n on ev'ry \
coast, My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost: Ease of my cares, and \
solace of my pain, Sav'd thro' a thousand toils, but sav'd in vain The \
prophet, who my future woes reveal'd, Yet this, the greatest and the worst, \
conceal'd; And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill Denounc'd all else, was \
silent of the ill. This my last labor was. Some friendly god From thence \
convey'd us to your blest abode.\" Thus, to the list'ning queen, the royal \
guest His wand'ring course and all his toils express'd; And here concluding, \
he retir'd to rest. BOOK IV But anxious cares already seiz'd the queen: She \
fed within her veins a flame unseen; The hero's valor, acts, and birth \
inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire. His words, his looks, \
imprinted in her heart, Improve the passion, and increase the smart. Now, \
when the purple morn had chas'd away The dewy shadows, and restor'd the day, \
Her sister first with early care she sought, And thus in mournful accents \
eas'd her thought: \"My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright My lab'ring \
soul! what visions of the night Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast With \
strange ideas of our Trojan guest! His worth, his actions, and majestic air, \
A man descended from the gods declare. Fear ever argues a degenerate kind; \
His birth is well asserted by his mind. Then, what he suffer'd, when by Fate \
betray'd! What brave attempts for falling Troy he made! Such were his looks, \
so gracefully he spoke, That, were I not resolv'd against the yoke Of hapless \
marriage, never to be curst With second love, so fatal was my first, To this \
one error I might yield again; For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain, This \
only man is able to subvert The fix'd foundations of my stubborn heart. And, \
to confess my frailty, to my shame, Somewhat I find within, if not the same, \
Too like the sparkles of my former flame. But first let yawning earth a \
passage rend, And let me thro' the dark abyss descend; First let avenging \
Jove, with flames from high, Drive down this body to the nether sky, \
Condemn'd with ghosts in endless night to lie, Before I break the plighted \
faith I gave! No! he who had my vows shall ever have; For, whom I lov'd on \
earth, I worship in the grave.\" She said: the tears ran gushing from her \
eyes, And stopp'd her speech. Her sister thus replies: \"O dearer than the \
vital air I breathe, Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath, \
Condemn'd to waste in woes your lonely life, Without the joys of mother or of \
wife? Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe, Are known or valued \
by the ghosts below? I grant that, while your sorrows yet were green, It well \
became a woman, and a queen, The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect, To scorn \
Hyarbas, and his love reject, With all the Libyan lords of mighty name; But \
will you fight against a pleasing flame! This little spot of land, which \
Heav'n bestows, On ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes; Gaetulian cities \
here are spread around, And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound; Here \
lies a barren waste of thirsty land, And there the Syrtes raise the moving \
sand; Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore, And from the sea Pygmalion \
threatens more. Propitious Heav'n, and gracious Juno, lead This wand'ring \
navy to your needful aid: How will your empire spread, your city rise, From \
such a union, and with such allies? Implore the favor of the pow'rs above, \
And leave the conduct of the rest to love. Continue still your hospitable \
way, And still invent occasions of their stay, Till storms and winter winds \
shall cease to threat, And planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet.\" \
These words, which from a friend and sister came, With ease resolv'd the \
scruples of her fame, And added fury to the kindled flame. Inspir'd with \
hope, the project they pursue; On ev'ry altar sacrifice renew: A chosen ewe \
of two years old they pay To Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of Day; Preferring \
Juno's pow'r, for Juno ties The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys. The \
beauteous queen before her altar stands, And holds the golden goblet in her \
hands. A milk-white heifer she with flow'rs adorns, And pours the ruddy wine \
betwixt her horns; And, while the priests with pray'r the gods invoke, She \
feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke, With hourly care the sacrifice renews, \
And anxiously the panting entrails views. What priestly rites, alas! what \
pious art, What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart! A gentle fire she feeds \
within her veins, Where the soft god secure in silence reigns. Sick with \
desire, and seeking him she loves, From street to street the raving Dido \
roves. So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind, Wounds with a random \
shaft the careless hind, Distracted with her pain she flies the woods, Bounds \
o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods, With fruitless care; for still \
the fatal dart Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart. And now she \
leads the Trojan chief along The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng; \
Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town, Which love, without his labor, \
makes his own. This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand'ring guest; Her \
falt'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest. When day declines, and feasts \
renew the night, Still on his face she feeds her famish'd sight; She longs \
again to hear the prince relate His own adventures and the Trojan fate. He \
tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain, For still she begs to hear it once \
again. The hearer on the speaker's mouth depends, And thus the tragic story \
never ends. Then, when they part, when Phoebe's paler light Withdraws, and \
falling stars to sleep invite, She last remains, when ev'ry guest is gone, \
Sits on the bed he press'd, and sighs alone; Absent, her absent hero sees and \
hears; Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears, And seeks the father's image in \
the child, If love by likeness might be so beguil'd. Meantime the rising \
tow'rs are at a stand; No labors exercise the youthful band, Nor use of arts, \
nor toils of arms they know; The mole is left unfinish'd to the foe; The \
mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie, Short of their promis'd heighth, \
that seem'd to threat the sky, But when imperial Juno, from above, Saw Dido \
fetter'd in the chains of love, Hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd, \
And by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd, With soothing words to Venus she \
begun: \"High praises, endless honors, you have won, And mighty trophies, \
with your worthy son! Two gods a silly woman have undone! Nor am I ignorant, \
you both suspect This rising city, which my hands erect: But shall celestial \
discord never cease? 'T is better ended in a lasting peace. You stand \
possess'd of all your soul desir'd: Poor Dido with consuming love is fir'd. \
Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join; So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine: \
One common kingdom, one united line. Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey, And \
lofty Carthage for a dow'r convey.\" Then Venus, who her hidden fraud \
descried, Which would the scepter of the world misguide To Libyan shores, \
thus artfully replied: \"Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, And \
such alliance and such gifts refuse, If Fortune with our joint desires \
comply? The doubt is all from Jove and destiny; Lest he forbid, with absolute \
command, To mix the people in one common land- Or will the Trojan and the \
Tyrian line In lasting leagues and sure succession join? But you, the partner \
of his bed and throne, May move his mind; my wishes are your own.\" \"Mine,\" \
said imperial Juno, \"be the care; Time urges, now, to perfect this affair: \
Attend my counsel, and the secret share. When next the Sun his rising light \
displays, And gilds the world below with purple rays, The queen, Aeneas, and \
the Tyrian court Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort. There, \
while the huntsmen pitch their toils around, And cheerful horns from side to \
side resound, A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain With hail, and \
thunder, and tempestuous rain; The fearful train shall take their speedy \
flight, Dispers'd, and all involv'd in gloomy night; One cave a grateful \
shelter shall afford To the fair princess and the Trojan lord. I will myself \
the bridal bed prepare, If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there: So \
shall their loves be crown'd with due delights, And Hymen shall be present at \
the rites.\" The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles At her vain \
project, and discover'd wiles. The rosy morn was risen from the main, And \
horns and hounds awake the princely train: They issue early thro' the city \
gate, Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait, With nets, and toils, and \
darts, beside the force Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse. The \
Tyrian peers and officers of state For the slow queen in antechambers wait; \
Her lofty courser, in the court below, Who his majestic rider seems to know, \
Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground, And champs the golden bit, \
and spreads the foam around. The queen at length appears; on either hand The \
brawny guards in martial order stand. A flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she \
wore, And at her back a golden quiver bore; Her flowing hair a golden caul \
restrains, A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains. Then young Ascanius, with \
a sprightly grace, Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase. But far above \
the rest in beauty shines The great Aeneas, the troop he joins; Like fair \
Apollo, when he leaves the frost Of wint'ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast, \
When to his native Delos he resorts, Ordains the dances, and renews the \
sports; Where painted Scythians, mix'd with Cretan bands, Before the joyful \
altars join their hands: Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below The merry \
madness of the sacred show. Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose; \
A golden fillet binds his awful brows; His quiver sounds: not less the prince \
is seen In manly presence, or in lofty mien. Now had they reach'd the hills, \
and storm'd the seat Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat. The cry \
pursues the mountain goats: they bound From rock to rock, and keep the craggy \
ground; Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train, In herds unsingled, \
scour the dusty plain, And a long chase in open view maintain. The glad \
Ascanius, as his courser guides, Spurs thro' the vale, and these and those \
outrides. His horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel The clanking lash, \
and goring of the steel. Impatiently he views the feeble prey, Wishing some \
nobler beast to cross his way, And rather would the tusky boar attend, Or see \
the tawny lion downward bend. Meantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the \
skies: From pole to pole the forky lightning flies; The rattling thunders \
roll; and Juno pours A wintry deluge down, and sounding show'rs. The company, \
dispers'd, to converts ride, And seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow \
side. The rapid rains, descending from the hills, To rolling torrents raise \
the creeping rills. The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides, One \
common cavern in her bosom hides. Then first the trembling earth the signal \
gave, And flashing fires enlighten all the cave; Hell from below, and Juno \
from above, And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love. From this \
ill-omen'd hour in time arose Debate and death, and all succeeding woes. The \
queen, whom sense of honor could not move, No longer made a secret of her \
love, But call'd it marriage, by that specious name To veil the crime and \
sanctify the shame. The loud report thro' Libyan cities goes. Fame, the great \
ill, from small beginnings grows: Swift from the first; and ev'ry moment \
brings New vigor to her flights, new pinions to her wings. Soon grows the \
pigmy to gigantic size; Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies. Inrag'd \
against the gods, revengeful Earth Produc'd her last of the Titanian birth. \
Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste: A monstrous phantom, horrible \
and vast. As many plumes as raise her lofty flight, So many piercing eyes \
inlarge her sight; Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong, And ev'ry mouth \
is furnish'd with a tongue, And round with list'ning ears the flying plague \
is hung. She fills the peaceful universe with cries; No slumbers ever close \
her wakeful eyes; By day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews, And spreads \
thro' trembling crowds disastrous news; With court informers haunts, and \
royal spies; Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with \
lies. Talk is her business, and her chief delight To tell of prodigies and \
cause affright. She fills the people's ears with Dido's name, Who, lost to \
honor and the sense of shame, Admits into her throne and nuptial bed A \
wand'ring guest, who from his country fled: Whole days with him she passes in \
delights, And wastes in luxury long winter nights, Forgetful of her fame and \
royal trust, Dissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her lust. The goddess widely \
spreads the loud report, And flies at length to King Hyarba's court. When \
first possess'd with this unwelcome news Whom did he not of men and gods \
accuse? This prince, from ravish'd Garamantis born, A hundred temples did \
with spoils adorn, In Ammon's honor, his celestial sire; A hundred altars fed \
with wakeful fire; And, thro' his vast dominions, priests ordain'd, Whose \
watchful care these holy rites maintain'd. The gates and columns were with \
garlands crown'd, And blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground. He, when he \
heard a fugitive could move The Tyrian princess, who disdain'd his love, His \
breast with fury burn'd, his eyes with fire, Mad with despair, impatient with \
desire; Then on the sacred altars pouring wine, He thus with pray'rs implor'd \
his sire divine: \"Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race, Who feast on \
painted beds, with off'rings grace Thy temples, and adore thy pow'r divine \
With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine, Seest thou not this? or do we \
fear in vain Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign? Do thy broad \
hands the forky lightnings lance? Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of \
chance? A wand'ring woman builds, within our state, A little town, bought at \
an easy rate; She pays me homage, and my grants allow A narrow space of \
Libyan lands to plow; Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led, Admits a \
banish'd Trojan to her bed! And now this other Paris, with his train Of \
conquer'd cowards, must in Afric reign! (Whom, what they are, their looks and \
garb confess, Their locks with oil perfum'd, their Lydian dress.) He takes \
the spoil, enjoys the princely dame; And I, rejected I, adore an empty \
name.\" His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd, And held his altar's \
horns. The mighty Thund'rer heard; Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he \
found The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd, Lost in their loves, \
insensible of shame, And both forgetful of their better fame. He calls \
Cyllenius, and the god attends, By whom his menacing command he sends: \"Go, \
mount the western winds, and cleave the sky; Then, with a swift descent, to \
Carthage fly: There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days In slothful \
not and inglorious ease, Nor minds the future city, giv'n by fate. To him \
this message from my mouth relate: 'Not so fair Venus hop'd, when twice she \
won Thy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son. Hers was a hero, destin'd \
to command A martial race, and rule the Latian land, Who should his ancient \
line from Teucer draw, And on the conquer'd world impose the law.' If glory \
cannot move a mind so mean, Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean, Yet \
why should he defraud his son of fame, And grudge the Romans their immortal \
name! What are his vain designs! what hopes he more From his long ling'ring \
on a hostile shore, Regardless to redeem his honor lost, And for his race to \
gain th' Ausonian coast! Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake; With \
this command the slumb'ring warrior wake.\" Hermes obeys; with golden pinions \
binds His flying feet, and mounts the western winds: And, whether o'er the \
seas or earth he flies, With rapid force they bear him down the skies. But \
first he grasps within his awful hand The mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic \
wand; With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves; With this he drives \
them down the Stygian waves; With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight, \
And eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light. Thus arm'd, the god begins \
his airy race, And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space; Now sees \
the tops of Atlas, as he flies, Whose brawny back supports the starry skies; \
Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd, Is beaten by the winds, with \
foggy vapors bound. Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin The \
founts of rolling streams their race begin; A beard of ice on his large \
breast depends. Here, pois'd upon his wings, the god descends: Then, rested \
thus, he from the tow'ring height Plung'd downward, with precipitated flight, \
Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood. As waterfowl, who seek their \
fishy food, Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show; By turns they dance \
aloft, and dive below: Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies, And \
near the surface of the water flies, Till, having pass'd the seas, and \
cross'd the sands, He clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands: Where \
shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds, Now tow'rs within the clouds \
advance their heads. Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince New ramparts \
raising for the town's defense. A purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er, \
(Queen Dido's gift,) about his waist he wore; A sword, with glitt'ring gems \
diversified, For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side. Then thus, with \
winged words, the god began, Resuming his own shape: \"Degenerate man, Thou \
woman's property, what mak'st thou here, These foreign walls and Tyrian \
tow'rs to rear, Forgetful of thy own? All-pow'rful Jove, Who sways the world \
below and heav'n above, Has sent me down with this severe command: What means \
thy ling'ring in the Libyan land? If glory cannot move a mind so mean, Nor \
future praise from flitting pleasure wean, Regard the fortunes of thy rising \
heir: The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear, To whom th' Ausonian \
scepter, and the state Of Rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate.\" So spoke \
the god; and, speaking, took his flight, Involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out \
of sight. The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear; Mute was his tongue, \
and upright stood his hair. Revolving in his mind the stern command, He longs \
to fly, and loathes the charming land. What should he say? or how should he \
begin? What course, alas! remains to steer between Th' offended lover and the \
pow'rful queen? This way and that he turns his anxious mind, And all \
expedients tries, and none can find. Fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the \
means, After long thought, to this advice he leans: Three chiefs he calls, \
commands them to repair The fleet, and ship their men with silent care; Some \
plausible pretense he bids them find, To color what in secret he design'd. \
Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose, Before the love-sick lady \
heard the news; And move her tender mind, by slow degrees, To suffer what the \
sov'reign pow'r decrees: Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say. They \
hear with pleasure, and with haste obey. But soon the queen perceives the \
thin disguise: (What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes!) She was the \
first to find the secret fraud, Before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad. Love \
the first motions of the lover hears, Quick to presage, and ev'n in safety \
fears. Nor impious Fame was wanting to report The ships repair'd, the \
Trojans' thick resort, And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court. Frantic with \
fear, impatient of the wound, And impotent of mind, she roves the city round. \
Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear, When, from afar, their nightly god \
they hear, And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear. At length \
she finds the dear perfidious man; Prevents his form'd excuse, and thus \
began: \"Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly, And undiscover'd scape a \
lover's eye? Nor could my kindness your compassion move. Nor plighted vows, \
nor dearer bands of love? Or is the death of a despairing queen Not worth \
preventing, tho' too well foreseen? Ev'n when the wintry winds command your \
stay, You dare the tempests, and defy the sea. False as you are, suppose you \
were not bound To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound; Were Troy \
restor'd, and Priam's happy reign, Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging \
main? See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun? Now, by those holy vows, so \
late begun, By this right hand, (since I have nothing more To challenge, but \
the faith you gave before;) I beg you by these tears too truly shed, By the \
new pleasures of our nuptial bed; If ever Dido, when you most were kind, Were \
pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind; By these my pray'rs, if pray'rs \
may yet have place, Pity the fortunes of a falling race. For you I have \
provok'd a tyrant's hate, Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state; For you \
alone I suffer in my fame, Bereft of honor, and expos'd to shame. Whom have I \
now to trust, ungrateful guest? (That only name remains of all the rest!) \
What have I left? or whither can I fly? Must I attend Pygmalion's cruelty, Or \
till Hyarba shall in triumph lead A queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd \
bed? Had you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight, And left behind some \
pledge of our delight, Some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight, Some \
young Aeneas, to supply your place, Whose features might express his father's \
face; I should not then complain to live bereft Of all my husband, or be \
wholly left.\" Here paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes, By Jove's \
command; nor suffer'd love to rise, Tho' heaving in his heart; and thus at \
length replies: \"Fair queen, you never can enough repeat Your boundless \
favors, or I own my debt; Nor can my mind forget Eliza's name, While vital \
breath inspires this mortal frame. This only let me speak in my defense: I \
never hop'd a secret flight from hence, Much less pretended to the lawful \
claim Of sacred nuptials, or a husband's name. For, if indulgent Heav'n would \
leave me free, And not submit my life to fate's decree, My choice would lead \
me to the Trojan shore, Those relics to review, their dust adore, And Priam's \
ruin'd palace to restore. But now the Delphian oracle commands, And fate \
invites me to the Latian lands. That is the promis'd place to which I steer, \
And all my vows are terminated there. If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born, \
With walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn, Why may not we- like you, a \
foreign race- Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place? As often as the \
night obscures the skies With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise, \
Anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears, Chides my delay, and fills my soul \
with fears; And young Ascanius justly may complain Of his defrauded and \
destin'd reign. Ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd: Waking I saw him, \
and his message heard. From Jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright With \
radiant beams, and manifest to sight (The sender and the sent I both attest) \
These walls he enter'd, and those words express'd. Fair queen, oppose not \
what the gods command; Forc'd by my fate, I leave your happy land.\" Thus \
while he spoke, already she began, With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty \
man; From head to foot survey'd his person o'er, Nor longer these outrageous \
threats forebore: \"False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn! Not \
sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born, But hewn from harden'd entrails of \
a rock! And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck! Why should I fawn? what \
have I worse to fear? Did he once look, or lent a list'ning ear, Sigh'd when \
I sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?- All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind, \
So foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find. Of man's injustice why \
should I complain? The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain Triumphant \
treason; yet no thunder flies, Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes; \
Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies! Justice is fled, and Truth \
is now no more! I sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore; With needful food \
his hungry Trojans fed; I took the traitor to my throne and bed: Fool that I \
was- 't is little to repeat The rest- I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet. I \
rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads, And makes Heav'n accessary to his \
deeds. Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god, Now Hermes is employ'd from \
Jove's abode, To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state Of heav'nly pow'rs \
were touch'd with human fate! But go! thy flight no longer I detain- Go seek \
thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main! Yet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious \
vow, The faithless waves, not half so false as thou, Or secret sands, shall \
sepulchers afford To thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd lord. Then shalt \
thou call on injur'd Dido's name: Dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame, \
When death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame; Shall smile to see the \
traitor vainly weep: Her angry ghost, arising from the deep, Shall haunt thee \
waking, and disturb thy sleep. At least my shade thy punishment shall know, \
And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.\" Abruptly here she stops; \
then turns away Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day. Amaz'd he \
stood, revolving in his mind What speech to frame, and what excuse to find. \
Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led, And softly laid her on her \
ivory bed. But good Aeneas, tho' he much desir'd To give that pity which her \
grief requir'd; Tho' much he mourn'd, and labor'd with his love, Resolv'd at \
length, obeys the will of Jove; Reviews his forces: they with early care \
Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare. The fleet is soon afloat, in all \
its pride, And well-calk'd galleys in the harbor ride. Then oaks for oars \
they fell'd; or, as they stood, Of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood, \
Studious of flight. The beach is cover'd o'er With Trojan bands, that blacken \
all the shore: On ev'ry side are seen, descending down, Thick swarms of \
soldiers, loaden from the town. Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants, \
Fearful of winter, and of future wants, T' invade the corn, and to their \
cells convey The plunder'd forage of their yellow prey. The sable troops, \
along the narrow tracks, Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs: Some \
set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain; Some guard the spoil; some lash \
the lagging train; All ply their sev'ral tasks, and equal toil sustain. What \
pangs the tender breast of Dido tore, When, from the tow'r, she saw the \
cover'd shore, And heard the shouts of sailors from afar, Mix'd with the \
murmurs of the wat'ry war! All-pow'rful Love! what changes canst thou cause \
In human hearts, subjected to thy laws! Once more her haughty soul the tyrant \
bends: To pray'rs and mean submissions she descends. No female arts or aids \
she left untried, Nor counsels unexplor'd, before she died. \"Look, Anna! \
look! the Trojans crowd to sea; They spread their canvas, and their anchors \
weigh. The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind, Invoke the sea gods, \
and invite the wind. Could I have thought this threat'ning blow so near, My \
tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear. But do not you my last request deny; \
With yon perfidious man your int'rest try, And bring me news, if I must live \
or die. You are his fav'rite; you alone can find The dark recesses of his \
inmost mind: In all his trusted secrets you have part, And know the soft \
approaches to his heart. Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe; Tell \
him, I did not with the Grecians go, Nor did my fleet against his friends \
employ, Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy, Nor mov'd with hands profane his \
father's dust: Why should he then reject a just! Whom does he shun, and \
whither would he fly! Can he this last, this only pray'r deny! Let him at \
least his dang'rous flight delay, Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea. \
The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more: Let him pursue the promis'd Latian \
shore. A short delay is all I ask him now; A pause of grief, an interval from \
woe, Till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain Accustom'd sorrows, and inur'd \
to pain. If you in pity grant this one request, My death shall glut the \
hatred of his breast.\" This mournful message pious Anna bears, And seconds \
with her own her sister's tears: But all her arts are still employ'd in vain; \
Again she comes, and is refus'd again. His harden'd heart nor pray'rs nor \
threat'nings move; Fate, and the god, had stopp'd his ears to love. As, when \
the winds their airy quarrel try, Justling from ev'ry quarter of the sky, \
This way and that the mountain oak they bend, His boughs they shatter, and \
his branches rend; With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground; The \
hollow valleys echo to the sound: Unmov'd, the royal plant their fury mocks, \
Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks; Far as he shoots his tow'ring \
head on high, So deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie. No less a storm the \
Trojan hero bears; Thick messages and loud complaints he hears, And bandied \
words, still beating on his ears. Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his \
inward pains; But the firm purpose of his heart remains. The wretched queen, \
pursued by cruel fate, Begins at length the light of heav'n to hate, And \
loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees, To hasten on the death her soul \
decrees: Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine, She pours in \
sacrifice the purple wine, The purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood, And the \
white offer'd milk converts to mud. This dire presage, to her alone reveal'd, \
From all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd. A marble temple stood within \
the grove, Sacred to death, and to her murther'd love; That honor'd chapel \
she had hung around With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown'd: Oft, when \
she visited this lonely dome, Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb; \
She thought she heard him summon her away, Invite her to his grave, and chide \
her stay. Hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note The solitary screech \
owl strains her throat, And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height, With \
songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night. Besides, old prophecies \
augment her fears; And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears, Disdainful as by \
day: she seems, alone, To wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown, Guideless \
and dark; or, in a desart plain, To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain: \
Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear, He saw two suns, and double \
Thebes, appear; Or mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost Full in his face \
infernal torches toss'd, And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight, Flies \
o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright; The Furies guard the door and \
intercept his flight. Now, sinking underneath a load of grief, From death \
alone she seeks her last relief; The time and means resolv'd within her \
breast, She to her mournful sister thus address'd (Dissembling hope, her \
cloudy front she clears, And a false vigor in her eyes appears): \"Rejoice!\" \
she said. \"Instructed from above, My lover I shall gain, or lose my love. \
Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun, Long tracts of Ethiopian climates \
run: There a Massylian priestess I have found, Honor'd for age, for magic \
arts renown'd: Th' Hesperian temple was her trusted care; 'T was she supplied \
the wakeful dragon's fare. She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep, \
Reclaim'd his rage, and sooth'd him into sleep. She watch'd the golden fruit; \
her charms unbind The chains of love, or fix them on the mind: She stops the \
torrents, leaves the channel dry, Repels the stars, and backward bears the \
sky. The yawning earth rebellows to her call, Pale ghosts ascend, and \
mountain ashes fall. Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part, How loth I am \
to try this impious art! Within the secret court, with silent care, Erect a \
lofty pile, expos'd in air: Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest, Spoils, \
arms, and presents, of my faithless guest. Next, under these, the bridal bed \
be plac'd, Where I my ruin in his arms embrac'd: All relics of the wretch are \
doom'd to fire; For so the priestess and her charms require.\" Thus far she \
said, and farther speech forbears; A mortal paleness in her face appears: Yet \
the mistrustless Anna could not find The secret fun'ral in these rites \
design'd; Nor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind. Unknowing of a train \
conceal'd so well, She fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell; Therefore \
obeys. The fatal pile they rear, Within the secret court, expos'd in air. The \
cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high, And garlands on the hollow spaces \
lie. Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath, And ev'ry baleful green \
denoting death. The queen, determin'd to the fatal deed, The spoils and sword \
he left, in order spread, And the man's image on the nuptial bed. And now \
(the sacred altars plac'd around) The priestess enters, with her hair \
unbound, And thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground. Night, Erebus, and \
Chaos she proclaims, And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names, And three \
Dianas: next, she sprinkles round With feign'd Avernian drops the hallow'd \
ground; Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe's light, With brazen sickles \
reap'd at noon of night; Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl, And cuts the \
forehead of a newborn foal, Robbing the mother's love. The destin'd queen \
Observes, assisting at the rites obscene; A leaven'd cake in her devoted \
hands She holds, and next the highest altar stands: One tender foot was shod, \
her other bare; Girt was her gather'd gown, and loose her hair. Thus dress'd, \
she summon'd, with her dying breath, The heav'ns and planets conscious of her \
death, And ev'ry pow'r, if any rules above, Who minds, or who revenges, \
injur'd love. \"'T was dead of night, when weary bodies close Their eyes in \
balmy sleep and soft repose: The winds no longer whisper thro' the woods, Nor \
murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods. The stars in silent order mov'd \
around; And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground The flocks \
and herds, and party-color'd fowl, Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy \
pool, Stretch'd on the quiet earth, securely lay, Forgetting the past labors \
of the day. All else of nature's common gift partake: Unhappy Dido was alone \
awake. Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find; Sleep fled her eyes, as \
quiet fled her mind. Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart; Despair \
and rage had some, but love the greater part. Then thus she said within her \
secret mind: \"What shall I do? what succor can I find? Become a suppliant to \
Hyarba's pride, And take my turn, to court and be denied? Shall I with this \
ungrateful Trojan go, Forsake an empire, and attend a foe? Himself I refug'd, \
and his train reliev'd- 'T is true- but am I sure to be receiv'd? Can \
gratitude in Trojan souls have place! Laomedon still lives in all his race! \
Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew, Or with my fleet their flying \
sails pursue? What force have I but those whom scarce before I drew reluctant \
from their native shore? Will they again embark at my desire, Once more \
sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre? Rather with steel thy guilty \
breast invade, And take the fortune thou thyself hast made. Your pity, \
sister, first seduc'd my mind, Or seconded too well what I design'd. These \
dear-bought pleasures had I never known, Had I continued free, and still my \
own; Avoiding love, I had not found despair, But shar'd with salvage beasts \
the common air. Like them, a lonely life I might have led, Not mourn'd the \
living, nor disturb'd the dead.\" These thoughts she brooded in her anxious \
breast. On board, the Trojan found more easy rest. Resolv'd to sail, in sleep \
he pass'd the night; And order'd all things for his early flight. To whom \
once more the winged god appears; His former youthful mien and shape he \
wears, And with this new alarm invades his ears: \"Sleep'st thou, O \
goddess-born! and canst thou drown Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town, \
Beset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales Invite thy passage, and \
inspire thy sails? She harbors in her heart a furious hate, And thou shalt \
find the dire effects too late; Fix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die. Haste \
swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly. The sea with ships will soon be \
cover'd o'er, And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore. Prevent her rage, \
while night obscures the skies, And sail before the purple morn arise. Who \
knows what hazards thy delay may bring? Woman's a various and a changeful \
thing.\" Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight Aloft in air unseen, \
and mix'd with night. Twice warn'd by the celestial messenger, The pious \
prince arose with hasty fear; Then rous'd his drowsy train without delay: \
\"Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh, And spread your flying \
sails, and stand to sea. A god commands: he stood before my sight, And urg'd \
us once again to speedy flight. O sacred pow'r, what pow'r soe'er thou art, \
To thy blest orders I resign my heart. Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan \
bands, And prosper the design thy will commands.\" He said: and, drawing \
forth his flaming sword, His thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord. An \
emulating zeal inspires his train: They run; they snatch; they rush into the \
main. With headlong haste they leave the desert shores, And brush the liquid \
seas with lab'ring oars. Aurora now had left her saffron bed, And beams of \
early light the heav'ns o'erspread, When, from a tow'r, the queen, with \
wakeful eyes, Saw day point upward from the rosy skies. She look'd to \
seaward; but the sea was void, And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried. \
Stung with despite, and furious with despair, She struck her trembling \
breast, and tore her hair. \"And shall th' ungrateful traitor go,\" she said, \
\"My land forsaken, and my love betray'd? Shall we not arm? not rush from \
ev'ry street, To follow, sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet? Haste, haul my \
galleys out! pursue the foe! Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row! \
What have I said? where am I? Fury turns My brain; and my distemper'd bosom \
burns. Then, when I gave my person and my throne, This hate, this rage, had \
been more timely shown. See now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name, The \
pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame, Preserv'd his gods, and to the \
Phrygian shore The burthen of his feeble father bore! I should have torn him \
piecemeal; strow'd in floods His scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods; \
Destroy'd his friends and son; and, from the fire, Have set the reeking boy \
before the sire. Events are doubtful, which on battles wait: Yet where's the \
doubt, to souls secure of fate? My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command, \
Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band; At once extinguish'd all the \
faithless name; And I myself, in vengeance of my shame, Had fall'n upon the \
pile, to mend the fun'ral flame. Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world \
below; Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow; Thou Hecate hearken from thy \
dark abodes! Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods, All pow'rs invok'd with \
Dido's dying breath, Attend her curses and avenge her death! If so the Fates \
ordain, Jove commands, Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands, \
Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes, His peaceful entrance with dire \
arms oppose: Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field, His men \
discourag'd, and himself expell'd, Let him for succor sue from place to \
place, Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace. First, let him see his \
friends in battle slain, And their untimely fate lament in vain; And when, at \
length, the cruel war shall cease, On hard conditions may he buy his peace: \
Nor let him then enjoy supreme command; But fall, untimely, by some hostile \
hand, And lie unburied on the barren sand! These are my pray'rs, and this my \
dying will; And you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil. Perpetual hate and \
mortal wars proclaim, Against the prince, the people, and the name. These \
grateful off'rings on my grave bestow; Nor league, nor love, the hostile \
nations know! Now, and from hence, in ev'ry future age, When rage excites \
your arms, and strength supplies the rage Rise some avenger of our Libyan \
blood, With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood; Our arms, our seas, our \
shores, oppos'd to theirs; And the same hate descend on all our heirs!\" This \
said, within her anxious mind she weighs The means of cutting short her \
odious days. Then to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said (For, when she left her \
country, hers was dead): \"Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care The solemn \
rites of sacrifice prepare; The sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring, \
Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring With living drops; then let her \
come, and thou With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow. Thus will I pay my \
vows to Stygian Jove, And end the cares of my disastrous love; Then cast the \
Trojan image on the fire, And, as that burns, my passions shall expire.\" The \
nurse moves onward, with officious care, And all the speed her aged limbs can \
bear. But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd, Shook at the mighty \
mischief she resolv'd. With livid spots distinguish'd was her face; Red were \
her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace; Ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she \
drew her breath, And nature shiver'd at approaching death. Then swiftly to \
the fatal place she pass'd, And mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste; \
Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind (Not for so dire an enterprise \
design'd). But when she view'd the garments loosely spread, Which once he \
wore, and saw the conscious bed, She paus'd, and with a sigh the robes \
embrac'd; Then on the couch her trembling body cast, Repress'd the ready \
tears, and spoke her last: \"Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so \
pleas'd, Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd: My fatal course is \
finish'd; and I go, A glorious name, among the ghosts below. A lofty city by \
my hands is rais'd, Pygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd. What could my \
fortune have afforded more, Had the false Trojan never touch'd my shore!\" \
Then kiss'd the couch; and, \"Must I die,\" she said, \"And unreveng'd? 'T is \
doubly to be dead! Yet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive: On any terms, \
't is better than to live. These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view; \
These boding omens his base flight pursue!\" She said, and struck; deep \
enter'd in her side The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed: Clogg'd in \
the wound the cruel weapon stands; The spouting blood came streaming on her \
hands. Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke, And with loud cries the \
sounding palace shook. Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled, And thro' \
the town the dismal rumor spread. First from the frighted court the yell \
began; Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran: The groans of men, with \
shrieks, laments, and cries Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies. Not \
less the clamor, than if- ancient Tyre, Or the new Carthage, set by foes on \
fire- The rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes, Involv'd the blazing temples \
of their gods. Her sister hears; and, furious with despair, She beats her \
breast, and rends her yellow hair, And, calling on Eliza's name aloud, Runs \
breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd. \"Was all that pomp of woe for \
this prepar'd; These fires, this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd? Was all \
this train of plots contriv'd,\" said she, \"All only to deceive unhappy me? \
Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend To scorn thy sister, or \
delude thy friend? Thy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come; One sword \
had serv'd us both, one common tomb: Was I to raise the pile, the pow'rs \
invoke, Not to be present at the fatal stroke? At once thou hast destroy'd \
thyself and me, Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony! Bring water; bathe the \
wound; while I in death Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying \
breath.\" This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste, And in her arms \
the gasping queen embrac'd; Her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore, To \
stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore. Thrice Dido tried to raise \
her drooping head, And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed; Thrice \
op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light, But, having found it, sicken'd at \
the sight, And clos'd her lids at last in endless night. Then Juno, grieving \
that she should sustain A death so ling'ring, and so full of pain, Sent Iris \
down, to free her from the strife Of lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life. \
For since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree, Or her own crime, but \
human casualty, And rage of love, that plung'd her in despair, The Sisters \
had not cut the topmost hair, Which Proserpine and they can only know; Nor \
made her sacred to the shades below. Downward the various goddess took her \
flight, And drew a thousand colors from the light; Then stood above the dying \
lover's head, And said: \"I thus devote thee to the dead. This off'ring to \
th' infernal gods I bear.\" Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair: The \
struggling soul was loos'd, and life dissolv'd in air. BOOK V Meantime the \
Trojan cuts his wat'ry way, Fix'd on his voyage, thro' the curling sea; Then, \
casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, Sees on the Punic shore the mounting \
blaze. The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind The fate of Dido from the \
fire divin'd; He knew the stormy souls of womankind, What secret springs \
their eager passions move, How capable of death for injur'd love. Dire \
auguries from hence the Trojans draw; Till neither fires nor shining shores \
they saw. Now seas and skies their prospect only bound; An empty space above, \
a floating field around. But soon the heav'ns with shadows were o'erspread; A \
swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head: Livid it look'd, the \
threat'ning of a storm: Then night and horror ocean's face deform. The pilot, \
Palinurus, cried aloud: \"What gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud My \
thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars, Stand to your tackle, mates, and \
stretch your oars; Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.\" The \
frighted crew perform the task assign'd. Then, to his fearless chief: \"Not \
Heav'n,\" said he, \"Tho' Jove himself should promise Italy, Can stem the \
torrent of this raging sea. Mark how the shifting winds from west arise, And \
what collected night involves the skies! Nor can our shaken vessels live at \
sea, Much less against the tempest force their way. 'T is fate diverts our \
course, and fate we must obey. Not far from hence, if I observ'd aright The \
southing of the stars, and polar light, Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores \
In safety we may reach with struggling oars.\" Aeneas then replied: \"Too \
sure I find We strive in vain against the seas and wind: Now shift your \
sails; what place can please me more Than what you promise, the Sicilian \
shore, Whose hallow'd earth Anchises' bones contains, And where a prince of \
Trojan lineage reigns?\" The course resolv'd, before the western wind They \
scud amain, and make the port assign'd. Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, \
Beheld the fleet descending on the land; And, not unmindful of his ancient \
race, Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, And held the hero in a \
strict embrace. Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, And either hand a \
pointed jav'lin bore. His mother was a dame of Dardan blood; His sire \
Crinisus, a Sicilian flood. He welcomes his returning friends ashore With \
plenteous country cates and homely store. Now, when the following morn had \
chas'd away The flying stars, and light restor'd the day, Aeneas call'd the \
Trojan troops around, And thus bespoke them from a rising ground: \"Offspring \
of heav'n, divine Dardanian race! The sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal \
space, The shining circle of the year has fill'd, Since first this isle my \
father's ashes held: And now the rising day renews the year; A day for ever \
sad, for ever dear. This would I celebrate with annual games, With gifts on \
altars pil'd, and holy flames, Tho' banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands, \
Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands: But since this happy storm our \
fleet has driv'n (Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav'n) Upon these \
friendly shores and flow'ry plains, Which hide Anchises and his blest \
remains, Let us with joy perform his honors due, And pray for prosp'rous \
winds, our voyage to renew; Pray, that in towns and temples of our own, The \
name of great Anchises may be known, And yearly games may spread the gods' \
renown. Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race, With royal gifts ordain'd, is \
pleas'd to grace: Two steers on ev'ry ship the king bestows; His gods and \
ours shall share your equal vows. Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn \
Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn, That day with solemn sports I \
mean to grace: Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race; Some shall \
in swiftness for the goal contend, And others try the twanging bow to bend; \
The strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand Oppos'd in combat on the \
yellow sand. Let all be present at the games prepar'd, And joyful victors \
wait the just reward. But now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd.\" He \
said, and first his brows with myrtle bound. Then Helymus, by his example \
led, And old Acestes, each adorn'd his head; Thus young Ascanius, with a \
sprightly grace, His temples tied, and all the Trojan race. Aeneas then \
advanc'd amidst the train, By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain, To \
great Anchises' tomb; which when he found, He pour'd to Bacchus, on the \
hallow'd ground, Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more, And two (from \
offer'd bulls) of purple gore, With roses then the sepulcher he strow'd And \
thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud: \"Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again, \
Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain! The gods permitted not, that you, with \
me, Should reach the promis'd shores of Italy, Or Tiber's flood, what flood \
soe'er it be.\" Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride, A serpent \
from the tomb began to glide; His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd; \
Blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold: Thus riding on \
his curls, he seem'd to pass A rolling fire along, and singe the grass. More \
various colors thro' his body run, Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun. \
Betwixt the rising altars, and around, The sacred monster shot along the \
ground; With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd, And with his lolling \
tongue assay'd the taste: Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest Within \
the hollow tomb retir'd to rest. The pious prince, surpris'd at what he \
view'd, The fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd, Doubtful if this place's \
genius were, Or guardian of his father's sepulcher. Five sheep, according to \
the rites, he slew; As many swine, and steers of sable hue; New gen'rous wine \
he from the goblets pour'd. And call'd his father's ghost, from hell \
restor'd. The glad attendants in long order come, Off'ring their gifts at \
great Anchises' tomb: Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil; Some place \
the chargers on the grassy soil; Some blow the fires, and off entrails broil. \
Now came the day desir'd. The skies were bright With rosy luster of the \
rising light: The bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame Of Trojan feasts \
and great Acestes' name, The crowded shore with acclamations fill, Part to \
behold, and part to prove their skill. And first the gifts in public view \
they place, Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace: Within the \
circle, arms and tripods lie, Ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high, And \
vests embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye. The trumpet's clangor then the feast \
proclaims, And all prepare for their appointed games. Four galleys first, \
which equal rowers bear, Advancing, in the wat'ry lists appear. The speedy \
Dolphin, that outstrips the wind, Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind: \
Gyas the vast Chimaera's bulk commands, Which rising, like a tow'ring city \
stands; Three Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar; Three banks in three degrees \
the sailors bore; Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar. Sergesthus, \
who began the Sergian race, In the great Centaur took the leading place; \
Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood, From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan \
blood. Far in the sea, against the foaming shore, There stands a rock: the \
raging billows roar Above his head in storms; but, when 't is clear, Uncurl \
their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear. In peace below the gentle waters \
run; The cormorants above lie basking in the sun. On this the hero fix'd an \
oak in sight, The mark to guide the mariners aright. To bear with this, the \
seamen stretch their oars; Then round the rock they steer, and seek the \
former shores. The lots decide their place. Above the rest, Each leader \
shining in his Tyrian vest; The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs \
Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows: Besmear'd with oil, their \
naked shoulders shine. All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign: They \
gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast Is rais'd by turns with hope, by \
turns with fear depress'd. The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign; At once \
they start, advancing in a line: With shouts the sailors rend the starry \
skies; Lash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise; Sparkles the briny \
main, and the vex'd ocean fries. Exact in time, with equal strokes they row: \
At once the brushing oars and brazen prow Dash up the sandy waves, and ope \
the depths below. Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race, Invade the field \
with half so swift a pace; Not the fierce driver with more fury lends The \
sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends, Low to the wheels his pliant \
body bends. The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide, And aid with \
eager shouts the favor'd side. Cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound, \
From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound. Amidst the loud applauses \
of the shore, Gyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before: Cloanthus, better \
mann'd, pursued him fast, But his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste. The \
Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine With equal oars, advancing in a line; \
And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead, And now the speedy Dolphin gets \
ahead; Now board to board the rival vessels row, The billows lave the skies, \
and ocean groans below. They reach'd the mark. Proud Gyas and his train In \
triumph rode, the victors of the main; But, steering round, he charg'd his \
pilot stand More close to shore, and skim along the sand- \"Let others bear \
to sea!\" Menoetes heard; But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd, And, \
fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd. With louder cries the \
captain call'd again: \"Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main.\" He \
spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw The bold Cloanthus near the \
shelvings draw. Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood, And in a closer \
compass plow'd the flood. He pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before: Gyas \
blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore, Cried out for anger, and his hair he \
tore. Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown His rising rage) and \
careless of his own, The trembling dotard to the deck he drew; Then hoisted \
up, and overboard he threw: This done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows \
cheer'd, Turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd. Hardly his head the \
plunging pilot rears, Clogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his years: \
Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain. The crowd, that saw him fall \
and float again, Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd, To see his \
heaving breast disgorge the briny draught. The following Centaur, and the \
Dolphin's crew, Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew; While Gyas lags, they \
kindle in the race, To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place; Mnestheus \
pursues; and while around they wind, Comes up, not half his galley's length \
behind; Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd, And thus their drooping \
courage he cheer'd: \"My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore, Exert \
your vigor; tug the lab'ring oar; Stretch to your strokes, my still \
unconquer'd crew, Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew. In this, our \
common int'rest, let me find That strength of hand, that courage of the mind, \
As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood, And o'er the Syrtes' broken \
billows row'd. I seek not now the foremost palm to gain; Tho' yet- but, ah! \
that haughty wish is vain! Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain. But to be \
last, the lags of all the race!- Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace.\
\" Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row At the full stretch, and shake \
the brazen prow. The sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides Are swell'd, \
and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides. Chance aids their daring with unhop'd \
success; Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press Betwixt the rival galley \
and the rock, Shuts up th' unwieldly Centaur in the lock. The vessel struck; \
and, with the dreadful shock, Her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke. \
The trembling rowers from their banks arise, And, anxious for themselves, \
renounce the prize. With iron poles they heave her off the shores, And gather \
from the sea their floating oars. The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds, \
Urge their success, and call the willing winds; Then ply their oars, and cut \
their liquid way In larger compass on the roomy sea. As, when the dove her \
rocky hold forsakes, Rous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes; The \
cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies, And leaves her callow care, and \
cleaves the skies: At first she flutters; but at length she springs To \
smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings: So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts \
the sea; And, flying with a force, that force assists his way. Sergesthus in \
the Centaur soon he pass'd, Wedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast. In \
vain the victor he with cries implores, And practices to row with shatter'd \
oars. Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies: The ship, without a \
pilot, yields the prize. Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains; Her he \
pursues, and all his vigor strains. Shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise; \
Applauding Echo to the shouts replies; Shouts, wishes, and applause run \
rattling thro' the skies. These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard, Much \
grudg'd the praise, but more the robb'd reward: Resolv'd to hold their own, \
they mend their pace, All obstinate to die, or gain the race. Rais'd with \
success, the Dolphin swiftly ran; For they can conquer, who believe they can. \
Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies, And both perhaps had shar'd \
an equal prize; When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands, And succor from \
the wat'ry pow'rs demands: \"Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row! If, \
giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow, Assist to make me guilty of my vow! A \
snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain; His offer'd entrails cast into \
the main, And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown, Your grateful gift and \
my return shall own.\" The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below, With \
virgin Panopea, heard his vow; And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand, \
Push'd on, and sped the galley to the land. Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, \
she flies, And, darting to the port, obtains the prize. The herald summons \
all, and then proclaims Cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games. The prince \
with laurel crowns the victor's head, And three fat steers are to his vessel \
led, The ship's reward; with gen'rous wine beside, And sums of silver, which \
the crew divide. The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest; The victor \
honor'd with a nobler vest, Where gold and purple strive in equal rows, And \
needlework its happy cost bestows. There Ganymede is wrought with living art, \
Chasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart: Breathless he seems, yet eager \
to pursue; When from aloft descends, in open view, The bird of Jove, and, \
sousing on his prey, With crooked talons bears the boy away. In vain, with \
lifted hands and gazing eyes, His guards behold him soaring thro' the skies, \
And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries. Mnestheus the second victor \
was declar'd; And, summon'd there, the second prize he shard. A coat of mail, \
brave Demoleus bore, More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore, In single \
combat on the Trojan shore: This was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess; In \
war for his defense, for ornament in peace. Rich was the gift, and glorious \
to behold, But yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold, That scarce two \
servants could the weight sustain; Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain \
Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train. The third, succeeding to the \
last reward, Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd, With figures prominent, \
and richly wrought, And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought. Thus all, \
rewarded by the hero's hands, Their conqu'ring temples bound with purple \
bands; And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock, Brought back his galley \
shatter'd with the shock. Forlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar, And, \
houted by the vulgar, made to shore. As when a snake, surpris'd upon the \
road, Is crush'd athwart her body by the load Of heavy wheels; or with a \
mortal wound Her belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground: In vain, with \
loosen'd curls, she crawls along; Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her \
tongue; Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales; But, groveling in \
the dust, her parts unsound she trails: So slowly to the port the Centaur \
tends, But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends. Yet, for his galley \
sav'd, the grateful prince Is pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense. \
Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care, Beauteous herself, with lovely \
twins as fair. From thence his way the Trojan hero bent Into the neighb'ring \
plain, with mountains pent, Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. \
Full in the midst of this fair valley stood A native theater, which, rising \
slow By just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below. High on a sylvan throne \
the leader sate; A num'rous train attend in solemn state. Here those that in \
the rapid course delight, Desire of honor and the prize invite. The rival \
runners without order stand; The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band. First \
Nisus, with Euryalus, appears; Euryalus a boy of blooming years, With \
sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd; Nisus, for friendship to the youth \
renown'd. Diores next, of Priam's royal race, Then Salius joined with Patron, \
took their place; (But Patron in Arcadia had his birth, And Salius his from \
Arcananian earth;) Then two Sicilian youths- the names of these, Swift \
Helymus, and lovely Panopes: Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred, And \
owning old Acestes for their head; With sev'ral others of ignobler name, Whom \
time has not deliver'd o'er to fame. To these the hero thus his thoughts \
explain'd, In words which gen'ral approbation gain'd: \"One common largess is \
for all design'd, (The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,) Two darts \
of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood, A silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd. The \
foremost three have olive wreaths decreed: The first of these obtains a \
stately steed, Adorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame, The quiver of an \
Amazonian dame, With feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied: A golden belt \
shall gird his manly side, Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied. The \
third this Grecian helmet shall content.\" He said. To their appointed base \
they went; With beating hearts th' expected sign receive, And, starting all \
at once, the barrier leave. Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew, \
And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view. Shot from the crowd, swift \
Nisus all o'erpass'd; Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste. The \
next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd, Came Salius, and Euryalus behind; \
Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied, Step after step, and almost side by \
side, His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space, Had won, or left at least \
a dubious race. Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last, When eager \
Nisus, hapless in his haste, Slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the \
plain, Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain. The careless victor had not \
mark'd his way; But, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay, His heels \
flew up; and on the grassy floor He fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore. \
Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee, Nor of the sacred bonds of amity, He \
strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross, And caught the foot of Salius as \
he rose. So Salius lay extended on the plain; Euryalus springs out, the prize \
to gain, And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend The victor to the \
goal, who vanquish'd by his friend. Next Helymus; and then Diores came, By \
two misfortunes made the third in fame. But Salius enters, and, exclaiming \
loud For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd; Urges his cause may in the \
court be heard; And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd. But favor for \
Euryalus appears; His blooming beauty, with his tender tears, Had brib'd the \
judges for the promis'd prize. Besides, Diores fills the court with cries, \
Who vainly reaches at the last reward, If the first palm on Salius be \
conferr'd. Then thus the prince: \"Let no disputes arise: Where fortune \
plac'd it, I award the prize. But fortune's errors give me leave to mend, At \
least to pity my deserving friend.\" He said, and, from among the spoils, he \
draws (Pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws) A lion's hide: to Salius \
this he gives. Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves. \"If such rewards \
to vanquish'd men are due.\" He said, \"and falling is to rise by you, What \
prize may Nisus from your bounty claim, Who merited the first rewards and \
fame? In falling, both an equal fortune tried; Would fortune for my fall so \
well provide!\" With this he pointed to his face, and show'd His hand and all \
his habit smear'd with blood. Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd, And \
caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield, Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought, \
Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought. This giv'n to Nisus, he \
divides the rest, And equal justice in his gifts express'd. The race thus \
ended, and rewards bestow'd, Once more the princes bespeaks th' attentive \
crowd: \"If there he here whose dauntless courage dare In gauntlet-fight, \
with limbs and body bare, His opposite sustain in open view, Stand forth the \
champion, and the games renew. Two prizes I propose, and thus divide: A bull \
with gilded horns, and fillets tied, Shall be the portion of the conqu'ring \
chief; A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief.\" Then haughty Dares \
in the lists appears; Stalking he strides, his head erected bears: His \
nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield, And loud applauses echo thro' the \
field. Dares alone in combat us'd to stand The match of mighty Paris, hand to \
hand; The same, at Hector's fun'rals, undertook Gigantic Butes, of th' \
Amycian stock, And, by the stroke of his resistless hand, Stretch'd the vast \
bulk upon the yellow sand. Such Dares was; and such he strode along, And drew \
the wonder of the gazing throng. His brawny back and ample breast he shows, \
His lifted arms around his head he throws, And deals in whistling air his \
empty blows. His match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band, Not one \
dares answer to the proud demand. Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes \
Already he devours the promis'd prize. He claims the bull with awless \
insolence, And having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince: \"If none my \
matchless valor dares oppose, How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes? \
Permit me, chief, permit without delay, To lead this uncontended gift away.\" \
The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries For the proud challenger demands \
the prize. Acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see The palm usurp'd without \
a victory, Reproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside, And heard and saw, \
unmov'd, the Trojan's pride: \"Once, but in vain, a champion of renown, So \
tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown, A prize in triumph borne before your \
sight, And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight? Where is our Eryx now, \
the boasted name, The god who taught your thund'ring arm the game? Where now \
your baffled honor? Where the spoil That fill'd your house, and fame that \
fill'd our isle?\" Entellus, thus: \"My soul is still the same, Unmov'd with \
fear, and mov'd with martial fame; But my chill blood is curdled in my veins, \
And scarce the shadow of a man remains. O could I turn to that fair prime \
again, That prime of which this boaster is so vain, The brave, who this \
decrepid age defies, Should feel my force, without the promis'd prize.\" He \
said; and, rising at the word, he threw Two pond'rous gauntlets down in open \
view; Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield, And sheathe his hands with \
in the listed field. With fear and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds The \
gloves of death, with sev'n distinguish'd folds Of tough bull hides; the \
space within is spread With iron, or with loads of heavy lead: Dares himself \
was daunted at the sight, Renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight. \
Astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands, And pois'd the pond'rous engines \
in his hands. \"What had your wonder,\" said Entellus, \"been, Had you the \
gauntlets of Alcides seen, Or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green! \
These which I bear your brother Eryx bore, Still mark'd with batter'd brains \
and mingled gore. With these he long sustain'd th' Herculean arm; And these I \
wielded while my blood was warm, This languish'd frame while better spirits \
fed, Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head. But if the \
challenger these arms refuse, And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use; \
If great Aeneas and Acestes join In his request, these gauntlets I resign; \
Let us with equal arms perform the fight, And let him leave to fear, since I \
resign my right.\" This said, Entellus for the strife prepares; Stripp'd of \
his quilted coat, his body bares; Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he \
stands, A goodly tow'ring object on the sands. Then just Aeneas equal arms \
supplied, Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied. Both on the \
tiptoe stand, at full extent, Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent; Their \
heads from aiming blows they bear afar; With clashing gauntlets then provoke \
the war. One on his youth and pliant limbs relies; One on his sinews and his \
giant size. The last is stiff with age, his motion slow; He heaves for \
breath, he staggers to and fro, And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils \
loudly blow. Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike; Their ways are \
diff'rent, but their art alike. Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around \
Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound. A storm of strokes, well \
meant, with fury flies, And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes. Nor \
always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws A sweeping stroke along the crackling \
jaws. Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground, But with his warping body \
wards the wound. His hand and watchful eye keep even pace; While Dares \
traverses and shifts his place, And, like a captain who beleaguers round Some \
strong-built castle on a rising ground, Views all th' approaches with \
observing eyes: This and that other part in vain he tries, And more on \
industry than force relies. With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe; But \
Dares watch'd the motion from below, And slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long \
descending blow. Entellus wastes his forces on the wind, And, thus deluded of \
the stroke design'd, Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast And weighty \
limbs his ancient mother press'd. So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood \
On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood, Torn from the roots. The diff'ring \
nations rise, And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies, Acestus runs \
with eager haste, to raise The fall'n companion of his youthful days. \
Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return'd; With shame his glowing cheeks, \
his eyes with fury burn'd. Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast, And \
with redoubled force his foe he press'd. He lays on load with either hand, \
amain, And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain; Nor stops, nor stays; \
nor rest nor breath allows; But storms of strokes descend about his brows, A \
rattling tempest, and a hail of blows. But now the prince, who saw the wild \
increase Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease, And bounds Entellus' \
wrath, and bids the peace. First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came, And \
sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame. \"What fury seiz'd my friend? The \
gods,\" said he, \"To him propitious, and averse to thee, Have giv'n his arm \
superior force to thine. 'T is madness to contend with strength divine.\" The \
gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore His faithful friends unhappy Dares \
bore: His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood, And pounded teeth came \
rushing with his blood. Faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng, And \
hung his head, and trail'd his legs along. The sword and casque are carried \
by his train; But with his foe the palm and ox remain. The champion, then, \
before Aeneas came, Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame: \"O \
goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host, Mark with attention, and forgive my \
boast; Learn what I was, by what remains; and know From what impending fate \
you sav'd my foe.\" Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull; And, on \
his ample forehead aiming full, The deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the \
skull. Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound, But sprawls in pangs \
of death, and spurns the ground. Then, thus: \"In Dares' stead I offer this. \
Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice; Take the last gift my wither'd arms can \
yield: Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field.\" This done, \
Aeneas orders, for the close, The strife of archers with contending bows. The \
mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore With his own hands he raises on the \
shore. A flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie, The living mark at which \
their arrows fly. The rival archers in a line advance, Their turn of shooting \
to receive from chance. A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn: On \
the first scroll was read Hippocoon. The people shout. Upon the next was \
found Young Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd. The third contain'd \
Eurytion's noble name, Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame, Whom Pallas \
urg'd the treaty to confound, And send among the Greeks a feather'd wound. \
Acestes in the bottom last remain'd, Whom not his age from youthful sports \
restrain'd. Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows, And from the quiver \
each his arrow chose. Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway It flew, \
and, whizzing, cut the liquid way. Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon \
stands: The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands, And the tree trembled, and \
the shouting cries Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies. Then \
Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove, With lifted eyes, and took his aim \
above, But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove; Yet miss'd so narrow, \
that he cut the cord Which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird. The \
captive thus releas'd, away she flies, And beats with clapping wings the \
yielding skies. His bow already bent, Eurytion stood; And, having first \
invok'd his brother god, His winged shaft with eager haste he sped. The fatal \
message reach'd her as she fled: She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the \
ground, And renders back the weapon in the wound. Acestes, grudging at his \
lot, remains, Without a prize to gratify his pains. Yet, shooting upward, \
sends his shaft, to show An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow. The \
feather'd arrow gave a dire portent, And latter augurs judge from this event. \
Chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew, A trail of following flames \
ascending drew: Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way; Across the skies \
as falling meteors play, And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay. The \
Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare, And, trembling, turn their wonder into \
pray'r. The Dardan prince put on a smiling face, And strain'd Acestes with a \
close embrace; Then, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest, Turn'd the bad \
omen, nor his fears confess'd. \"The gods,\" said he, \"this miracle have \
wrought, And order'd you the prize without the lot. Accept this goblet, rough \
with figur'd gold, Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old: This pledge of \
ancient amity receive, Which to my second sire I justly give.\" He said, and, \
with the trumpets' cheerful sound, Proclaim'd him victor, and with \
laurel-crown'd. Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize, Tho' he transfix'd \
the pigeon in the skies. Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd; The \
third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast. The chief, before the games were \
wholly done, Call'd Periphantes, tutor to his son, And whisper'd thus: \"With \
speed Ascanius find; And, if his childish troop be ready join'd, On horseback \
let him grace his grandsire's day, And lead his equals arm'd in just array.\" \
He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears. The crowd withdrawn, an open \
plain appears. And now the noble youths, of form divine, Advance before their \
fathers, in a line; The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine. \
Thus marching on in military pride, Shouts of applause resound from side to \
side. Their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear, Each brandishing \
aloft a cornel spear. Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore; Their \
chains of burnish'd gold hung down before. Three graceful troops they form'd \
upon the green; Three graceful leaders at their head were seen; Twelve \
follow'd ev'ry chief, and left a space between. The first young Priam led; a \
lovely boy, Whose grandsire was th' unhappy king of Troy; His race in after \
times was known to fame, New honors adding to the Latian name; And well the \
royal boy his Thracian steed became. White were the fetlocks of his feet \
before, And on his front a snowy star he bore. Then beauteous Atys, with \
Iulus bred, Of equal age, the second squadron led. The last in order, but the \
first in place, First in the lovely features of his face, Rode fair Ascanius \
on a fiery steed, Queen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed. Sure coursers \
for the rest the king ordains, With golden bits adorn'd, and purple reins. \
The pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew, And all the parents in the \
children view; Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace, And \
hopes and fears alternate in their face. Th' unfledg'd commanders and their \
martial train First make the circuit of the sandy plain Around their sires, \
and, at th' appointed sign, Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line. The \
second signal sounds, the troop divides In three distinguish'd parts, with \
three distinguish'd guides Again they close, and once again disjoin; In troop \
to troop oppos'd, and line to line. They meet; they wheel; they throw their \
darts afar With harmless rage and well-dissembled war. Then in a round the \
mingled bodies run: Flying they follow, and pursuing shun; Broken, they \
break; and, rallying, they renew In other forms the military shew. At last, \
in order, undiscern'd they join, And march together in a friendly line. And, \
as the Cretan labyrinth of old, With wand'ring ways and many a winding fold, \
Involv'd the weary feet, without redress, In a round error, which denied \
recess; So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play, Turn'd and return'd, and \
still a diff'rent way. Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase In circles, \
when they swim around the wat'ry race. This game, these carousels, Ascanius \
taught; And, building Alba, to the Latins brought; Shew'd what he learn'd: \
the Latin sires impart To their succeeding sons the graceful art; From these \
imperial Rome receiv'd the game, Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, \
they name. Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate: But Fortune soon \
resum'd her ancient hate; For, while they pay the dead his annual dues, Those \
envied rites Saturnian Juno views; And sends the goddess of the various bow, \
To try new methods of revenge below; Supplies the winds to wing her airy way, \
Where in the port secure the navy lay. Swiftly fair Iris down her arch \
descends, And, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends. She saw the gath'ring \
crowd; and, gliding thence, The desart shore, and fleet without defense. The \
Trojan matrons, on the sands alone, With sighs and tears Anchises' death \
bemoan; Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes, Their pity to themselves \
renews their cries. \"Alas!\" said one, \"what oceans yet remain For us to \
sail! what labors to sustain!\" All take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan, \
Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own. The goddess, great in \
mischief, views their pains, And in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs \
restrains. In face and shape old Beroe she became, Doryclus' wife, a \
venerable dame, Once blest with riches, and a mother's name. Thus chang'd, \
amidst the crying crowd she ran, Mix'd with the matrons, and these words \
began: \"O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow'r, Nor flames, destroy'd, in \
Troy's unhappy hour! O wretched we, reserv'd by cruel fate, Beyond the ruins \
of the sinking state! Now sev'n revolving years are wholly run, Since this \
improsp'rous voyage we begun; Since, toss'd from shores to shores, from lands \
to lands, Inhospitable rocks and barren sands, Wand'ring in exile thro' the \
stormy sea, We search in vain for flying Italy. Now cast by fortune on this \
kindred land, What should our rest and rising walls withstand, Or hinder here \
to fix our banish'd band? O country lost, and gods redeem'd in vain, If still \
in endless exile we remain! Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew, Or \
streams of some dissembled Simois view! Haste, join with me, th' unhappy \
fleet consume! Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom. In sleep I saw her; \
she supplied my hands (For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands: \
'With these,' said she, 'these wand'ring ships destroy: These are your fatal \
seats, and this your Troy.' Time calls you now; the precious hour employ: \
Slack not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires Our minds to dare, and \
gives the ready fires. See! Neptune's altars minister their brands: The god \
is pleas'd; the god supplies our hands.\" Then from the pile a flaming fire \
she drew, And, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw. Wrapp'd in amaze, the \
matrons wildly stare: Then Pyrgo, reverenc'd for her hoary hair, Pyrgo, the \
nurse of Priam's num'rous race: \"No Beroe this, tho' she belies her face! \
What terrors from her frowning front arise! Behold a goddess in her ardent \
eyes! What rays around her heav'nly face are seen! Mark her majestic voice, \
and more than mortal mien! Beroe but now I left, whom, pin'd with pain, Her \
age and anguish from these rites detain,\" She said. The matrons, seiz'd with \
new amaze, Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze. They fear, and \
hope, and neither part obey: They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal \
way. The goddess, having done her task below, Mounts up on equal wings, and \
bends her painted bow. Struck with the sight, and seiz'd with rage divine, \
The matrons prosecute their mad design: They shriek aloud; they snatch, with \
impious hands, The food of altars; fires and flaming brands. Green boughs and \
saplings, mingled in their haste, And smoking torches, on the ships they \
cast. The flame, unstopp'd at first, more fury gains, And Vulcan rides at \
large with loosen'd reins: Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars, And \
seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars. Eumelus was the first the \
news to bear, While yet they crowd the rural theater. Then, what they hear, \
is witness'd by their eyes: A storm of sparkles and of flames arise. Ascanius \
took th' alarm, while yet he led His early warriors on his prancing steed, \
And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd; Nor could his frighted friends \
reclaim his haste. Soon as the royal youth appear'd in view, He sent his \
voice before him as he flew: \"What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy \
The last remainders of unhappy Troy! Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, \
you burn, And on your friends your fatal fury turn. Behold your own Ascanius!\
\" While he said, He drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head, In which the \
youths to sportful arms he led. By this, Aeneas and his train appear; And now \
the women, seiz'd with shame and fear, Dispers'd, to woods and caverns take \
their flight, Abhor their actions, and avoid the light; Their friends \
acknowledge, and their error find, And shake the goddess from their alter'd \
mind. Not so the raging fires their fury cease, But, lurking in the seams, \
with seeming peace, Work on their way amid the smold'ring tow, Sure in \
destruction, but in motion slow. The silent plague thro' the green timber \
eats, And vomits out a tardy flame by fits. Down to the keels, and upward to \
the sails, The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; Nor buckets \
pour'd, nor strength of human hand, Can the victorious element withstand. The \
pious hero rends his robe, and throws To heav'n his hands, and with his hands \
his vows. \"O Jove,\" he cried, \"if pray'rs can yet have place; If thou \
abhorr'st not all the Dardan race; If any spark of pity still remain; If gods \
are gods, and not invok'd in vain; Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train! \
Yet from the flames our burning vessels free, Or let thy fury fall alone on \
me! At this devoted head thy thunder throw, And send the willing sacrifice \
below!\" Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise: From pole to pole \
the forky lightning flies; Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain; \
Heav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain. Whole sheets of water from the \
clouds are sent, Which, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent, And \
stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone Burn to the waist, and for the fleet \
atone. But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide; If he should still in \
Sicily reside, Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main, In hope the \
promis'd Italy to gain. Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone The will of \
Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown; Vers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd \
To tell events, and what the fates requir'd; Thus while he stood, to neither \
part inclin'd, With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind: \"O \
goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry state, With patience bear, with prudence push \
your fate. By suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue; Fly when she frowns, \
and, when she calls, pursue. Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind; To him \
disclose the secrets of your mind: Trust in his hands your old and useless \
train; Too num'rous for the ships which yet remain: The feeble, old, \
indulgent of their ease, The dames who dread the dangers of the seas, With \
all the dastard crew, who dare not stand The shock of battle with your foes \
by land. Here you may build a common town for all, And, from Acestes' name, \
Acesta call.\" The reasons, with his friend's experience join'd, Encourag'd \
much, but more disturb'd his mind. 'T was dead of night; when to his \
slumb'ring eyes His father's shade descended from the skies, And thus he \
spoke: \"O more than vital breath, Lov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after \
death; O son, in various toils and troubles toss'd, The King of Heav'n \
employs my careful ghost On his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire Your \
flaming fleet, and heard your just desire. The wholesome counsel of your \
friend receive, And here the coward train and woman leave: The chosen youth, \
and those who nobly dare, Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war. The \
stern Italians will their courage try; Rough are their manners, and their \
minds are high. But first to Pluto's palace you shall go, And seek my shade \
among the blest below: For not with impious ghosts my soul remains, Nor \
suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains, But breathes the living air of soft \
Elysian plains. The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey, And blood of \
offer'd victims free the way. There shall you know what realms the gods \
assign, And learn the fates and fortunes of your line. But now, farewell! I \
vanish with the night, And feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light.\" He \
said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy flight. \"Whither so fast?\" \
the filial duty cried; \"And why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?\" He \
said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires, He rakes hot embers, and renews the \
fires; His country gods and Vesta then adores With cakes and incense, and \
their aid implores. Next, for his friends and royal host he sent, Reveal'd \
his vision, and the gods' intent, With his own purpose. All, without delay, \
The will of Jove, and his desires obey. They list with women each degenerate \
name, Who dares not hazard life for future fame. These they cashier: the \
brave remaining few, Oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew. The \
prince designs a city with the plow; The lots their sev'ral tenements allow. \
This part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy, And the new king ascends the \
throne with joy; A chosen senate from the people draws; Appoints the judges, \
and ordains the laws. Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin A rising temple to \
the Paphian queen. Anchises, last, is honor'd as a god; A priest is added, \
annual gifts bestow'd, And groves are planted round his blest abode. Nine \
days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd; And fumes of incense in the \
fanes abound. Then from the south arose a gentle breeze That curl'd the \
smoothness of the glassy seas; The rising winds a ruffling gale afford, And \
call the merry mariners aboard. Now loud laments along the shores resound, Of \
parting friends in close embraces bound. The trembling women, the degenerate \
train, Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main, Ev'n those desire to \
sail, and take their share Of the rough passage and the promis'd war: Whom \
good Aeneas cheers, and recommends To their new master's care his fearful \
friends. On Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays; A lamb new-fallen to the \
stormy seas; Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs. High on the \
deck the godlike hero stands, With olive crown'd, a charger in his hands; \
Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine, And pour'd the sacrifice of \
purple wine. Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie, And brush the \
buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly. Meantime the mother goddess, full of \
fears, To Neptune thus address'd, with tender tears: \"The pride of Jove's \
imperious queen, the rage, The malice which no suff'rings can assuage, Compel \
me to these pray'rs; since neither fate, Nor time, nor pity, can remove her \
hate: Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife; Still vanquish'd, yet she \
still renews the strife. As if 't were little to consume the town Which aw'd \
the world, and wore th' imperial crown, She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with \
pains, And gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains. Let her the causes of \
her hatred tell; But you can witness its effects too well. You saw the storm \
she rais'd on Libyan floods, That mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds; \
When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main, And mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry \
reign. With fury she possess'd the Dardan dames, To burn their fleet with \
execrable flames, And forc'd Aeneas, when his ships were lost, To leave his \
foll'wers on a foreign coast. For what remains, your godhead I implore, And \
trust my son to your protecting pow'r. If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree \
withstand, Secure his passage to the Latian land.\" Then thus the mighty \
Ruler of the Main: \"What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign? My kingdom \
claims your birth; my late defense Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your \
confidence. Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare How much your lov'd \
Aeneas is my care. Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest. Your Trojan \
troops when proud Achilles press'd, And drove before him headlong on the \
plain, And dash'd against the walls the trembling train; When floods were \
fill'd with bodies of the slain; When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way, \
Stood up on ridges to behold the sea; (New heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd \
his way;) When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds Of force unequal, and \
unequal gods; I spread a cloud before the victor's sight, Sustain'd the \
vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight; Ev'n then secur'd him, when I sought with \
joy The vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy. My will's the same: fair \
goddess, fear no more, Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore; Their \
lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone Shall perish, and for multitudes \
atone.\" Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind, His finny team \
Saturnian Neptune join'd, Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws, And to \
the loosen'd reins permits the laws. High on the waves his azure car he \
guides; Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides, And the smooth ocean rolls \
her silent tides. The tempests fly before their father's face, Trains of \
inferior gods his triumph grace, And monster whales before their master play, \
And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way. The marshal'd pow'rs in equal \
troops divide To right and left; the gods his better side Inclose, and on the \
worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride. Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude, \
Within the hero's mind his joys renew'd. He calls to raise the masts, the \
sheets display; The cheerful crew with diligence obey; They scud before the \
wind, and sail in open sea. Ahead of all the master pilot steers; And, as he \
leads, the following navy veers. The steeds of Night had travel'd half the \
sky, The drowsy rowers on their benches lie, When the soft God of Sleep, with \
easy flight, Descends, and draws behind a trail of light. Thou, Palinurus, \
art his destin'd prey; To thee alone he takes his fatal way. Dire dreams to \
thee, and iron sleep, he bears; And, lighting on thy prow, the form of \
Phorbas wears. Then thus the traitor god began his tale: \"The winds, my \
friend, inspire a pleasing gale; The ships, without thy care, securely sail. \
Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I Will take the rudder and thy room \
supply.\" To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep: \"Me dost thou bid to trust \
the treach'rous deep, The harlot smiles of her dissembling face, And to her \
faith commit the Trojan race? Shall I believe the Siren South again, And, oft \
betray'd, not know the monster main?\" He said: his fasten'd hands the rudder \
keep, And, fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep. The god was wroth, \
and at his temples threw A branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with Stygian \
dew: The pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine, Soon clos'd his swimming \
eyes, and lay supine. Scarce were his limbs extended at their length, The \
god, insulting with superior strength, Fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the \
sea, And, with the stern, the rudder tore away. Headlong he fell, and, \
struggling in the main, Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain. The \
victor daemon mounts obscure in air, While the ship sails without the pilot's \
care. On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies; But what the man forsook, \
the god supplies, And o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies; Glides \
by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast, Long infamous for ships and sailors \
lost, And white with bones. Th' impetuous ocean roars, And rocks rebellow \
from the sounding shores. The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found The \
tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground. Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes \
himself The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf. Inly he griev'd, \
and, groaning from the breast, Deplor'd his death; and thus his pain \
express'd: \"For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring sky, Thy naked \
corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie.\" BOOK VI He said, and wept; then \
spread his sails before The winds, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore: \
Their anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor. They turn their heads to \
sea, their sterns to land, And greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand. Some \
strike from clashing flints their fiery seed; Some gather sticks, the kindled \
flames to feed, Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods, Or trace \
thro' valleys the discover'd floods. Thus, while their sev'ral charges they \
fulfil, The pious prince ascends the sacred hill Where Phoebus is ador'd; and \
seeks the shade Which hides from sight his venerable maid. Deep in a cave the \
Sibyl makes abode; Thence full of fate returns, and of the god. Thro' \
Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold, And enter now, the temple roof'd \
with gold. When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore, His heavy limbs on jointed \
pinions bore, (The first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by Fame, To the \
Cumaean coast at length he came, And here alighting, built this costly frame. \
Inscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high The steerage of his wings, that \
cut the sky: Then o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd Androgeos' death, and \
off'rings to his ghost; Sev'n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet The \
fate appointed by revengeful Crete. And next to those the dreadful urn was \
plac'd, In which the destin'd names by lots were cast: The mournful parents \
stand around in tears, And rising Crete against their shore appears. There \
too, in living sculpture, might be seen The mad affection of the Cretan \
queen; Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye; The rushing leap, the \
doubtful progeny, The lower part a beast, a man above, The monument of their \
polluted love. Not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze, A thousand \
doors, a thousand winding ways: Here dwells the monster, hid from human view, \
Not to be found, but by the faithful clew; Till the kind artist, mov'd with \
pious grief, Lent to the loving maid this last relief, And all those erring \
paths describ'd so well That Theseus conquer'd and the monster fell. Here \
hapless Icarus had found his part, Had not the father's grief restrain'd his \
art. He twice assay'd to cast his son in gold; Twice from his hands he \
dropp'd the forming mold. All this with wond'ring eyes Aeneas view'd; Each \
varying object his delight renew'd: Eager to read the rest- Achates came, And \
by his side the mad divining dame, The priestess of the god, Deiphobe her \
name. \"Time suffers not,\" she said, \"to feed your eyes With empty \
pleasures; haste the sacrifice. Sev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd, for Phoebus \
choose, And for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes.\" This said, the servants urge \
the sacred rites, While to the temple she the prince invites. A spacious \
cave, within its farmost part, Was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art Thro' \
the hill's hollow sides: before the place, A hundred doors a hundred entries \
grace; As many voices issue, and the sound Of Sybil's words as many times \
rebound. Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries: \"This is the time; \
enquire your destinies. He comes; behold the god!\" Thus while she said, (And \
shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd,) Her color chang'd; her face was not \
the same, And hollow groans from her deep spirit came. Her hair stood up; \
convulsive rage possess'd Her trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring \
breast. Greater than humankind she seem'd to look, And with an accent more \
than mortal spoke. Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll; When all the \
god came rushing on her soul. Swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke: \
\"Why this delay?\" she cried- \"the pow'rs invoke! Thy pray'rs alone can \
open this abode; Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god.\" She said no \
more. The trembling Trojans hear, O'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear. \
The prince himself, with awful dread possess'd, His vows to great Apollo thus \
address'd: \"Indulgent god, propitious pow'r to Troy, Swift to relieve, \
unwilling to destroy, Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart Pierc'd the \
proud Grecian's only mortal part: Thus far, by fate's decrees and thy \
commands, Thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands, Our exil'd crew has \
sought th' Ausonian ground; And now, at length, the flying coast is found. \
Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place, With fury has pursued her \
wand'ring race. Here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end: Troy is no \
more, and can no more offend. And thou, O sacred maid, inspir'd to see Th' \
event of things in dark futurity; Give me what Heav'n has promis'd to my \
fate, To conquer and command the Latian state; To fix my wand'ring gods, and \
find a place For the long exiles of the Trojan race. Then shall my grateful \
hands a temple rear To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r; And annual \
rites, and festivals, and games, Shall be perform'd to their auspicious \
names. Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land; For there thy faithful \
oracles shall stand, Preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay, Which, by \
thy mouth, Apollo shall convey: All shall be treasur'd by a chosen train Of \
holy priests, and ever shall remain. But O! commit not thy prophetic mind To \
flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind, Lest they disperse in air our empty \
fate; Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate.\" Struggling in vain, \
impatient of her load, And lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god, The more \
she strove to shake him from her breast, With more and far superior force he \
press'd; Commands his entrance, and, without control, Usurps her organs and \
inspires her soul. Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors Ope of \
themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice \
restores: \"Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign, Yet more and greater \
ills by land remain. The coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event), Thy \
troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent. Wars, horrid wars, I view- a \
field of blood, And Tiber rolling with a purple flood. Simois nor Xanthus \
shall be wanting there: A new Achilles shall in arms appear, And he, too, \
goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate, Added to hostile force, shall urge thy \
fate. To what strange nations shalt not thou resort, Driv'n to solicit aid at \
ev'ry court! The cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd; A foreign \
mistress, and a foreign guest. But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes, \
The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose. The dawnings of thy safety \
shall be shown From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town.\" Thus, \
from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke, And the resisting air the thunder \
broke; The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook. Th' ambiguous god, who \
rul'd her lab'ring breast, In these mysterious words his mind express'd; Some \
truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest. At length her fury fell, her \
foaming ceas'd, And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd. Then thus the \
chief: \"No terror to my view, No frightful face of danger can be new. Inur'd \
to suffer, and resolv'd to dare, The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be \
without my care. This let me crave, since near your grove the road To hell \
lies open, and the dark abode Which Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood; \
Conduct me thro' the regions void of light, And lead me longing to my \
father's sight. For him, a thousand dangers I have sought, And, rushing where \
the thickest Grecians fought, Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought. He, \
for my sake, the raging ocean tried, And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious \
guide, And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied. Oft, since he \
breath'd his last, in dead of night His reverend image stood before my sight; \
Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade; Conducted there by your unerring \
aid. But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won, Oblige the father, and \
protect the son. Yours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain Has made you \
priestess of her nightly reign. If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre, \
The ruthless king with pity could inspire, And from the shades below redeem \
his wife; If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life, Could free his brother, and \
can daily go By turns aloft, by turns descend below- Why name I Theseus, or \
his greater friend, Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend? Not \
less than theirs from Jove my lineage came; My mother greater, my descent the \
same.\" So pray'd the Trojan prince, and, while he pray'd, His hand upon the \
holy altar laid. Then thus replied the prophetess divine: \"O goddess-born of \
great Anchises' line, The gates of hell are open night and day; Smooth the \
descent, and easy is the way: But to return, and view the cheerful skies, In \
this the task and mighty labor lies. To few great Jupiter imparts this grace, \
And those of shining worth and heav'nly race. Betwixt those regions and our \
upper light, Deep forests and impenetrable night Possess the middle space: \
th' infernal bounds Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds. But if so dire \
a love your soul invades, As twice below to view the trembling shades; If you \
so hard a toil will undertake, As twice to pass th' innavigable lake; Receive \
my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove There stands a tree; the queen of \
Stygian Jove Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night Conceal the \
happy plant from human sight. One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!) \
The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold: This from the vulgar branches \
must be torn, And to fair Proserpine the present borne, Ere leave be giv'n to \
tempt the nether skies. The first thus rent a second will arise, And the same \
metal the same room supplies. Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see \
The lurking gold upon the fatal tree: Then rend it off, as holy rites \
command; The willing metal will obey thy hand, Following with ease, if \
favor'd by thy fate, Thou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state: If not, \
no labor can the tree constrain; And strength of stubborn arms and steel are \
vain. Besides, you know not, while you here attend, Th' unworthy fate of your \
unhappy friend: Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost, Depriv'd of \
fun'ral rites, pollutes your host. Pay first his pious dues; and, for the \
dead, Two sable sheep around his hearse be led; Then, living turfs upon his \
body lay: This done, securely take the destin'd way, To find the regions \
destitute of day.\" She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went Sad from the \
cave, and full of discontent, Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. Achates, \
the companion of his breast, Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares \
oppress'd. Walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd What friend the \
priestess by those words design'd. But soon they found an object to deplore: \
Misenus lay extended the shore; Son of the God of Winds: none so renown'd The \
warrior trumpet in the field to sound; With breathing brass to kindle fierce \
alarms, And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms. He serv'd great \
Hector, and was ever near, Not with his trumpet only, but his spear. But by \
Pelides' arms when Hector fell, He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well. Swoln \
with applause, and aiming still at more, He now provokes the sea gods from \
the shore; With envy Triton heard the martial sound, And the bold champion, \
for his challenge, drown'd; Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand: The \
gazing crowd around the body stand. All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his \
fate, And hastens to perform the funeral state. In altar-wise, a stately pile \
they rear; The basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air. An ancient wood, \
fit for the work design'd, (The shady covert of the salvage kind,) The \
Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied; Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and \
the tow'ring pride Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke, And piercing \
wedges cleave the stubborn oak. Huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy \
crown Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down. Arm'd like the rest the \
Trojan prince appears, And by his pious labor urges theirs. Thus while he \
wrought, revolving in his mind The ways to compass what his wish design'd, He \
cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove, And then with vows implor'd the Queen of \
Love: \"O may thy pow'r, propitious still to me, Conduct my steps to find the \
fatal tree, In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath Foretold, alas! too \
true, Misenus' death.\" Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight, Two \
doves, descending from their airy flight, Secure upon the grassy plain \
alight. He knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd: \"Be you my guides, \
with your auspicious aid, And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, \
Whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground. And thou, great parent, with \
celestial care, In this distress be present to my pray'r!\" Thus having said, \
he stopp'd with watchful sight, Observing still the motions of their flight, \
What course they took, what happy signs they shew. They fed, and, flutt'ring, \
by degrees withdrew Still farther from the place, but still in view: Hopping \
and flying, thus they led him on To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to \
shun They wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low, Perch'd on the \
double tree that bears the golden bough. Thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring \
shadows glow; As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe, Where the proud \
mother views her precious brood, And happier branches, which she never sow'd. \
Such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind, And dancing leaves, that \
wanton'd in the wind. He seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold, And rent \
away, with ease, the ling'ring gold; Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the \
prize. Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes, To dead Misenus pay his \
obsequies. First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear, Of pitch trees, \
oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir: The fabric's front with cypress twigs they \
strew, And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew. The topmost part his \
glitt'ring arms adorn; Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne, Are \
pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint, And fragrant oils the stiffen'd \
limbs anoint. With groans and cries Misenus they deplore: Then on a bier, \
with purple cover'd o'er, The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay, And \
fire the pile, their faces turn'd away- Such reverend rites their fathers \
us'd to pay. Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw, And fat of victims, \
which his friends bestow. These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour; Then \
on the living coals red wine they pour; And, last, the relics by themselves \
dispose, Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose. Old Corynaeus compass'd \
thrice the crew, And dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew; Which thrice he \
sprinkled round, and thrice aloud Invok'd the dead, and then dismissed the \
crowd. But good Aeneas order'd on the shore A stately tomb, whose top a \
trumpet bore, A soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar. Thus was his friend \
interr'd; and deathless fame Still to the lofty cape consigns his name. These \
rites perform'd, the prince, without delay, Hastes to the nether world his \
destin'd way. Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went From the wide \
mouth, a rocky rough descent; And here th' access a gloomy grove defends, And \
there th' unnavigable lake extends, O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light, \
No bird presumes to steer his airy flight; Such deadly stenches from the \
depths arise, And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies. From hence the \
Grecian bards their legends make, And give the name Avernus to the lake. Four \
sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught, For sacrifice the pious hero brought. \
The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns; Then cuts the curling hair; \
that first oblation burns, Invoking Hecate hither to repair: A pow'rful name \
in hell and upper air. The sacred priests with ready knives bereave The \
beasts of life, and in full bowls receive The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell \
and Night (The sable wool without a streak of white) Aeneas offers; and, by \
fate's decree, A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee, With holocausts he \
Pluto's altar fills; Sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills; Then on \
the broiling entrails oil he pours; Which, ointed thus, the raging flame \
devours. Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun, Nor ended till the next \
returning sun. Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance, And howling dogs \
in glimm'ring light advance, Ere Hecate came. \"Far hence be souls profane!\" \
The Sibyl cried, \"and from the grove abstain! Now, Trojan, take the way thy \
fates afford; Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword.\" She said, and \
pass'd along the gloomy space; The prince pursued her steps with equal pace. \
Ye realms, yet unreveal'd to human sight, Ye gods who rule the regions of the \
night, Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate The mystic wonders of your \
silent state! Obscure they went thro' dreary shades, that led Along the waste \
dominions of the dead. Thus wander travelers in woods by night, By the moon's \
doubtful and malignant light, When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies, \
And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes. Just in the gate and \
in the jaws of hell, Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell, And pale \
Diseases, and repining Age, Want, Fear, and Famine's unresisted rage; Here \
Toils, and Death, and Death's half-brother, Sleep, Forms terrible to view, \
their sentry keep; With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind, Deep Frauds \
before, and open Force behind; The Furies' iron beds; and Strife, that shakes \
Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes. Full in the midst of this \
infernal road, An elm displays her dusky arms abroad: The God of Sleep there \
hides his heavy head, And empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread. Of various \
forms unnumber'd specters more, Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the \
door. Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands, And Briareus with all his \
hundred hands; Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame; And vain Chimaera \
vomits empty flame. The chief unsheath'd his shining steel, prepar'd, Tho' \
seiz'd with sudden fear, to force the guard, Off'ring his brandish'd weapon \
at their face; Had not the Sibyl stopp'd his eager pace, And told him what \
those empty phantoms were: Forms without bodies, and impassive air. Hence to \
deep Acheron they take their way, Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and \
clay, Are whirl'd aloft, and in Cocytus lost. There Charon stands, who rules \
the dreary coast- A sordid god: down from his hoary chin A length of beard \
descends, uncomb'd, unclean; His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire; A \
girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire. He spreads his canvas; \
with his pole he steers; The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom \
bears. He look'd in years; yet in his years were seen A youthful vigor and \
autumnal green. An airy crowd came rushing where he stood, Which fill'd the \
margin of the fatal flood: Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids, And \
mighty heroes' more majestic shades, And youths, intomb'd before their \
fathers' eyes, With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries. Thick as \
the leaves in autumn strow the woods, Or fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the \
floods, And wing their hasty flight to happier lands; Such, and so thick, the \
shiv'ring army stands, And press for passage with extended hands. Now these, \
now those, the surly boatman bore: The rest he drove to distance from the \
shore. The hero, who beheld with wond'ring eyes The tumult mix'd with \
shrieks, laments, and cries, Ask'd of his guide, what the rude concourse \
meant; Why to the shore the thronging people bent; What forms of law among \
the ghosts were us'd; Why some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd. \"Son of \
Anchises, offspring of the gods,\" The Sibyl said, \"you see the Stygian \
floods, The sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state Attests in oaths, and \
fears to violate. The ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew Depriv'd of \
sepulchers and fun'ral due: The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host, He \
ferries over to the farther coast; Nor dares his transport vessel cross the \
waves With such whose bones are not compos'd in graves. A hundred years they \
wander on the shore; At length, their penance done, are wafted o'er.\" The \
Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd, Revolving anxious thoughts within \
his breast, He saw his friends, who, whelm'd beneath the waves, Their fun'ral \
honors claim'd, and ask'd their quiet graves. The lost Leucaspis in the crowd \
he knew, And the brave leader of the Lycian crew, Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, \
the tempests met; The sailors master'd, and the ship o'erset. Amidst the \
spirits, Palinurus press'd, Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest, Who, \
while he steering view'd the stars, and bore His course from Afric to the \
Latian shore, Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix'd his view, And scarcely \
thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew. Then thus the prince: \"What envious \
pow'r, O friend, Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end? For Phoebus, \
ever true in all he said, Has in your fate alone my faith betray'd. The god \
foretold you should not die, before You reach'd, secure from seas, th' \
Italian shore. Is this th' unerring pow'r?\" The ghost replied; \"Nor Phoebus \
flatter'd, nor his answers lied; Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep: \
But, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep, My wearied eyes were seiz'd \
with fatal sleep. I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd Was drawn \
along, which yet my gripe retain'd. Now by the winds and raging waves I \
swear, Your safety, more than mine, was then my care; Lest, of the guide \
bereft, the rudder lost, Your ship should run against the rocky coast. Three \
blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast, I floated, and discover'd \
land at last: High on a mounting wave my head I bore, Forcing my strength, \
and gath'ring to the shore. Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz'd The \
craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd. While, cumber'd with my dropping \
clothes, I lay, The cruel nation, covetous of prey, Stain'd with my blood th' \
unhospitable coast; And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are \
toss'd: Which O avert, by yon ethereal light, Which I have lost for this \
eternal night! Or, if by dearer ties you may be won, By your dead sire, and \
by your living son, Redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost; Or with \
your navy seek the Velin coast, And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose; \
Or, if a nearer way your mother shows, Without whose aid you durst not \
undertake This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake, Lend to this wretch \
your hand, and waft him o'er To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore.\" \
Scarce had he said, the prophetess began: \"What hopes delude thee, miserable \
man? Think'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods, To view the Furies \
and infernal gods, And visit, without leave, the dark abodes? Attend the term \
of long revolving years; Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears. This \
comfort of thy dire misfortune take: The wrath of Heav'n, inflicted for thy \
sake, With vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast, Till they propitiate thy \
offended ghost, And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r; And Palinurus' \
name the place shall bear.\" This calm'd his cares; sooth'd with his future \
fame, And pleas'd to hear his propagated name. Now nearer to the Stygian lake \
they draw: Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw; Observ'd their \
passage thro' the shady wood, And mark'd their near approaches to the flood. \
Then thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath: \"Mortal, whate'er, who this \
forbidden path In arms presum'st to tread, I charge thee, stand, And tell thy \
name, and bus'ness in the land. Know this, the realm of night- the Stygian \
shore: My boat conveys no living bodies o'er; Nor was I pleas'd great Theseus \
once to bear, Who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear, Nor strong \
Alcides- men of mighty fame, And from th' immortal gods their lineage came. \
In fetters one the barking porter tied, And took him trembling from his \
sov'reign's side: Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride.\" To whom \
the Sibyl thus: \"Compose thy mind; Nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force \
design'd. Still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain Of airy ghosts, \
and vex the guilty train, And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain. \
The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove, Much fam'd for arms, and more \
for filial love, Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove. If neither \
piety, nor Heav'n's command, Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand, This \
fatal present shall prevail at least.\" Then shew'd the shining bough, \
conceal'd within her vest. No more was needful: for the gloomy god Stood mute \
with awe, to see the golden rod; Admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen- \
A venerable gift, so rarely seen. His fury thus appeas'd, he puts to land; \
The ghosts forsake their seats at his command: He clears the deck, receives \
the mighty freight; The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight. Slowly she \
sails, and scarcely stems the tides; The pressing water pours within her \
sides. His passengers at length are wafted o'er, Expos'd, in muddy weeds, \
upon the miry shore. No sooner landed, in his den they found The triple \
porter of the Stygian sound, Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear His \
crested snakes, and arm'd his bristling hair. The prudent Sibyl had before \
prepar'd A sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard; Which, mix'd with \
pow'rful drugs, she cast before His greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar. \
With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight, With hunger press'd, \
devours the pleasing bait. Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs \
enslave; He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave. The keeper charm'd, \
the chief without delay Pass'd on, and took th' irremeable way. Before the \
gates, the cries of babes new born, Whom fate had from their tender mothers \
torn, Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws Condemn'd to die, when \
traitors judg'd their cause. Nor want they lots, nor judges to review The \
wrongful sentence, and award a new. Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears; \
And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears. Round in his urn the blended \
balls he rolls, Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls. The next, in \
place and punishment, are they Who prodigally throw their souls away; Fools, \
who, repining at their wretched state, And loathing anxious life, suborn'd \
their fate. With late repentance now they would retrieve The bodies they \
forsook, and wish to live; Their pains and poverty desire to bear, To view \
the light of heav'n, and breathe the vital air: But fate forbids; the Stygian \
floods oppose, And with circling streams the captive souls inclose. Not far \
from thence, the Mournful Fields appear So call'd from lovers that inhabit \
there. The souls whom that unhappy flame invades, In secret solitude and \
myrtle shades Make endless moans, and, pining with desire, Lament too late \
their unextinguish'd fire. Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found, Baring her \
breast, yet bleeding with the wound Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there, \
With Phaedra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair. There Laodamia, with Evadne, \
moves, Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves: Caeneus, a woman once, and \
once a man, But ending in the sex she first began. Not far from these \
Phoenician Dido stood, Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood; Whom \
when the Trojan hero hardly knew, Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful \
view, (Doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night, Or thinks he sees, the \
moon's uncertain light,) With tears he first approach'd the sullen shade; \
And, as his love inspir'd him, thus he said: \"Unhappy queen! then is the \
common breath Of rumor true, in your reported death, And I, alas! the cause? \
By Heav'n, I vow, And all the pow'rs that rule the realms below, Unwilling I \
forsook your friendly state, Commanded by the gods, and forc'd by fate- Those \
gods, that fate, whose unresisted might Have sent me to these regions void of \
light, Thro' the vast empire of eternal night. Nor dar'd I to presume, that, \
press'd with grief, My flight should urge you to this dire relief. Stay, stay \
your steps, and listen to my vows: 'T is the last interview that fate allows!\
\" In vain he thus attempts her mind to move With tears, and pray'rs, and \
late-repenting love. Disdainfully she look'd; then turning round, But fix'd \
her eyes unmov'd upon the ground, And what he says and swears, regards no \
more Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar; But whirl'd away, to \
shun his hateful sight, Hid in the forest and the shades of night; Then \
sought Sichaeus thro' the shady grove, Who answer'd all her cares, and \
equal'd all her love. Some pious tears the pitying hero paid, And follow'd \
with his eyes the flitting shade, Then took the forward way, by fate \
ordain'd, And, with his guide, the farther fields attain'd, Where, sever'd \
from the rest, the warrior souls remain'd. Tydeus he met, with Meleager's \
race, The pride of armies, and the soldiers' grace; And pale Adrastus with \
his ghastly face. Of Trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train, All much \
lamented, all in battle slain; Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest, \
Antenor's sons, and Ceres' sacred priest. And proud Idaeus, Priam's \
charioteer, Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear. The gladsome \
ghosts, in circling troops, attend And with unwearied eyes behold their \
friend; Delight to hover near, and long to know What bus'ness brought him to \
the realms below. But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train, When his \
refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain, Fled from his well-known face, \
with wonted fear, As when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear Drove \
headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear. They rais'd a feeble \
cry, with trembling notes; But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats. \
Here Priam's son, Deiphobus, he found, Whose face and limbs were one \
continued wound: Dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears, Spoil'd of \
his nose, and shorten'd of his ears. He scarcely knew him, striving to disown \
His blotted form, and blushing to be known; And therefore first began: \"O \
Tsucer's race, Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface? What heart could \
wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace? 'Twas fam'd, that in our last \
and fatal night Your single prowess long sustain'd the fight, Till tir'd, not \
forc'd, a glorious fate you chose, And fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes. \
But, in remembrance of so brave a deed, A tomb and fun'ral honors I decreed; \
Thrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains: The place your armor and your \
name retains. Your body too I sought, and, had I found, Design'd for burial \
in your native ground.\" The ghost replied: \"Your piety has paid All needful \
rites, to rest my wand'ring shade; But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife, To \
Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life. These are the monuments of Helen's \
love: The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above. You know in what \
deluding joys we pass'd The night that was by Heav'n decreed our last: For, \
when the fatal horse, descending down, Pregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' \
unhappy town She feign'd nocturnal orgies; left my bed, And, mix'd with \
Trojan dames, the dances led Then, waving high her torch, the signal made, \
Which rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade. With watching overworn, with \
cares oppress'd, Unhappy I had laid me down to rest, And heavy sleep my weary \
limbs possess'd. Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid, And from beneath \
my head my sword convey'd; The door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls, \
Invites her former lord within my walls. Thus in her crime her confidence she \
plac'd, And with new treasons would redeem the past. What need I more? Into \
the room they ran, And meanly murther'd a defenseless man. Ulysses, basely \
born, first led the way. Avenging pow'rs! with justice if I pray, That \
fortune be their own another day! But answer you; and in your turn relate, \
What brought you, living, to the Stygian state: Driv'n by the winds and \
errors of the sea, Or did you Heav'n's superior doom obey? Or tell what other \
chance conducts your way, To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats, Tumults \
and torments of th' infernal seats.\" While thus in talk the flying hours \
they pass, The sun had finish'd more than half his race: And they, perhaps, \
in words and tears had spent The little time of stay which Heav'n had lent; \
But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay: \"Night rushes down, and headlong \
drives the day: 'T is here, in different paths, the way divides; The right to \
Pluto's golden palace guides; The left to that unhappy region tends, Which to \
the depth of Tartarus descends; The seat of night profound, and punish'd \
fiends.\" Then thus Deiphobus: \"O sacred maid, Forbear to chide, and be your \
will obey'd! Lo! to the secret shadows I retire, To pay my penance till my \
years expire. Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown'd, And born to \
better fates than I have found.\" He said; and, while he said, his steps he \
turn'd To secret shadows, and in silence mourn'd. The hero, looking on the \
left, espied A lofty tow'r, and strong on ev'ry side With treble walls, which \
Phlegethon surrounds, Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds; And, \
press'd betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds Wide is the fronting \
gate, and, rais'd on high With adamantine columns, threats the sky. Vain is \
the force of man, and Heav'n's as vain, To crush the pillars which the pile \
sustain. Sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd; And dire Tisiphone \
there keeps the ward, Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day, Observant \
of the souls that pass the downward way. From hence are heard the groans of \
ghosts, the pains Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains. The Trojan stood \
astonish'd at their cries, And ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise; \
And what the crimes, and what the tortures were, And loud laments that rent \
the liquid air. She thus replied: \"The chaste and holy race Are all \
forbidden this polluted place. But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods, \
Then led me trembling thro' these dire abodes, And taught the tortures of th' \
avenging gods. These are the realms of unrelenting fate; And awful \
Rhadamanthus rules the state. He hears and judges each committed crime; \
Enquires into the manner, place, and time. The conscious wretch must all his \
acts reveal, (Loth to confess, unable to conceal), From the first moment of \
his vital breath, To his last hour of unrepenting death. Straight, o'er the \
guilty ghost, the Fury shakes The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes, \
And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes. Then, of itself, unfolds th' \
eternal door; With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar. You see, before \
the gate, what stalking ghost Commands the guard, what sentries keep the \
post. More formidable Hydra stands within, Whose jaws with iron teeth \
severely grin. The gaping gulf low to the center lies, And twice as deep as \
earth is distant from the skies. The rivals of the gods, the Titan race, \
Here, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd space. Here lie th' \
Alaean twins, (I saw them both,) Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth, Who \
dar'd in fight the Thund'rer to defy, Affect his heav'n, and force him from \
the sky. Salmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains, I found, For emulating Jove; the \
rattling sound Of mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze Of pointed \
lightnings, and their forky rays. Thro' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew; \
Th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew: He wav'd a torch aloft, and, \
madly vain, Sought godlike worship from a servile train. Ambitious fool! with \
horny hoofs to pass O'er hollow arches of resounding brass, To rival thunder \
in its rapid course, And imitate inimitable force! But he, the King of \
Heav'n, obscure on high, Bar'd his red arm, and, launching from the sky His \
writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke, Down to the deep abyss the flaming \
felon strook. There Tityus was to see, who took his birth From heav'n, his \
nursing from the foodful earth. Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace, \
Infold nine acres of infernal space. A rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side, \
Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried; Still for the growing liver digg'd \
his breast; The growing liver still supplied the feast; Still are his \
entrails fruitful to their pains: Th' immortal hunger lasts, th' immortal \
food remains. Ixion and Perithous I could name, And more Thessalian chiefs of \
mighty fame. High o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd, That promises \
a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast. They lie below, on golden beds display'd; \
And genial feasts with regal pomp are made. The Queen of Furies by their \
sides is set, And snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat, Which if they \
touch, her hissing snakes she rears, Tossing her torch, and thund'ring in \
their ears. Then they, who brothers' better claim disown, Expel their \
parents, and usurp the throne; Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold, Sit \
brooding on unprofitable gold; Who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend To \
their poor kindred, or a wanting friend. Vast is the throng of these; nor \
less the train Of lustful youths, for foul adult'ry slain: Hosts of \
deserters, who their honor sold, And basely broke their faith for bribes of \
gold. All these within the dungeon's depth remain, Despairing pardon, and \
expecting pain. Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know Their process, \
or the forms of law below. Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along, And \
bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung Unhappy Theseus, \
doom'd for ever there, Is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair; And wretched \
Phlegyas warns the world with cries (Could warning make the world more just \
or wise): 'Learn righteousness, and dread th' avenging deities.' To tyrants \
others have their country sold, Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold; \
Some have old laws repeal'd, new statutes made, Not as the people pleas'd, \
but as they paid; With incest some their daughters' bed profan'd: All dar'd \
the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, attain'd. Had I a hundred mouths, a \
hundred tongues, And throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs, I could not \
half those horrid crimes repeat, Nor half the punishments those crimes have \
met. But let us haste our voyage to pursue: The walls of Pluto's palace are \
in view; The gate, and iron arch above it, stands On anvils labor'd by the \
Cyclops' hands. Before our farther way the Fates allow, Here must we fix on \
high the golden bough.\" She said: and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd, \
And chose the middle path. Arriv'd at last, The prince with living water \
sprinkled o'er His limbs and body; then approach'd the door, Possess'd the \
porch, and on the front above He fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto's \
love. These holy rites perform'd, they took their way Where long extended \
plains of pleasure lay: The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie, With \
ether vested, and a purple sky; The blissful seats of happy souls below. \
Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know; Their airy limbs in sports \
they exercise, And on the green contend the wrestler's prize. Some in heroic \
verse divinely sing; Others in artful measures led the ring. The Thracian \
bard, surrounded by the rest, There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest; \
His flying fingers, and harmonious quill, Strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, \
and sev'n at once they fill. Here found they Tsucer's old heroic race, Born \
better times and happier years to grace. Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy \
Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy. The chief beheld their chariots \
from afar, Their shining arms, and coursers train'd to war: Their lances \
fix'd in earth, their steeds around, Free from their harness, graze the \
flow'ry ground. The love of horses which they had, alive, And care of \
chariots, after death survive. Some cheerful souls were feasting on the \
plain; Some did the song, and some the choir maintain, Beneath a laurel \
shade, where mighty Po Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below. \
Here patriots live, who, for their country's good, In fighting fields, were \
prodigal of blood: Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode, And poets \
worthy their inspiring god; And searching wits, of more mechanic parts, Who \
grac'd their age with new-invented arts: Those who to worth their bounty did \
extend, And those who knew that bounty to commend. The heads of these with \
holy fillets bound, And all their temples were with garlands crown'd. To \
these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd, And first to him surrounded by the \
rest (Tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast): \"Say, happy souls, \
divine Musaeus, say, Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way To find the \
hero, for whose only sake We sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter \
lake?\" To this the sacred poet thus replied: \"In no fix'd place the happy \
souls reside. In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds, By crystal streams, \
that murmur thro' the meads: But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; The \
path conducts you to your journey's end.\" This said, he led them up the \
mountain's brow, And shews them all the shining fields below. They wind the \
hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go. But old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale, \
Review'd his muster'd race, and took the tale: Those happy spirits, which, \
ordain'd by fate, For future beings and new bodies wait- With studious \
thought observ'd th' illustrious throng, In nature's order as they pass'd \
along: Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care, In peaceful \
senates and successful war. He, when Aeneas on the plain appears, Meets him \
with open arms, and falling tears. \"Welcome,\" he said, \"the gods' \
undoubted race! O long expected to my dear embrace! Once more 't is giv'n me \
to behold your face! The love and pious duty which you pay Have pass'd the \
perils of so hard a way. 'T is true, computing times, I now believ'd The \
happy day approach'd; nor are my hopes deceiv'd. What length of lands, what \
oceans have you pass'd; What storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast? \
How have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most, When love assail'd you, on \
the Libyan coast.\" To this, the filial duty thus replies: \"Your sacred \
ghost before my sleeping eyes Appear'd, and often urg'd this painful \
enterprise. After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea, My navy rides at anchor \
in the bay. But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun The dear embraces \
of your longing son!\" He said; and falling tears his face bedew: Then thrice \
around his neck his arms he threw; And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd \
away, Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day. Now, in a secret vale, \
the Trojan sees A sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze Plays with a \
passing breath, and whispers thro' the trees; And, just before the confines \
of the wood, The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood. About the boughs an \
airy nation flew, Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew; In \
summer's heat on tops of lilies feed, And creep within their bells, to suck \
the balmy seed: The winged army roams the fields around; The rivers and the \
rocks remurmur to the sound. Aeneas wond'ring stood, then ask'd the cause \
Which to the stream the crowding people draws. Then thus the sire: \"The \
souls that throng the flood Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies \
ow'd: In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste, Of future life secure, \
forgetful of the past. Long has my soul desir'd this time and place, To set \
before your sight your glorious race, That this presaging joy may fire your \
mind To seek the shores by destiny design'd.\"- \"O father, can it be, that \
souls sublime Return to visit our terrestrial clime, And that the gen'rous \
mind, releas'd by death, Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?\" Anchises \
then, in order, thus begun To clear those wonders to his godlike son: \"Know, \
first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame, And flowing waters, and the \
starry flame, And both the radiant lights, one common soul Inspires and \
feeds, and animates the whole. This active mind, infus'd thro' all the space, \
Unites and mingles with the mighty mass. Hence men and beasts the breath of \
life obtain, And birds of air, and monsters of the main. Th' ethereal vigor \
is in all the same, And every soul is fill'd with equal flame; As much as \
earthy limbs, and gross allay Of mortal members, subject to decay, Blunt not \
the beams of heav'n and edge of day. From this coarse mixture of terrestrial \
parts, Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts, And grief, and joy; nor \
can the groveling mind, In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd, Assert the \
native skies, or own its heav'nly kind: Nor death itself can wholly wash \
their stains; But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains. The relics \
of inveterate vice they wear, And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear. \
For this are various penances enjoin'd; And some are hung to bleach upon the \
wind, Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires, Till all the dregs are \
drain'd, and all the rust expires. All have their manes, and those manes \
bear: The few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair, And breathe, in ample \
fields, the soft Elysian air. Then are they happy, when by length of time The \
scurf is worn away of each committed crime; No speck is left of their \
habitual stains, But the pure ether of the soul remains. But, when a thousand \
rolling years are past, (So long their punishments and penance last,) Whole \
droves of minds are, by the driving god, Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean \
flood, In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares Of their past labors, \
and their irksome years, That, unrememb'ring of its former pain, The soul may \
suffer mortal flesh again.\" Thus having said, the father spirit leads The \
priestess and his son thro' swarms of shades, And takes a rising ground, from \
thence to see The long procession of his progeny. \"Survey,\" pursued the \
sire, \"this airy throng, As, offer'd to thy view, they pass along. These are \
th' Italian names, which fate will join With ours, and graff upon the Trojan \
line. Observe the youth who first appears in sight, And holds the nearest \
station to the light, Already seems to snuff the vital air, And leans just \
forward, on a shining spear: Silvius is he, thy last-begotten race, But first \
in order sent, to fill thy place; An Alban name, but mix'd with Dardan blood, \
Born in the covert of a shady wood: Him fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife, \
Shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life. In Alba he shall fix his \
royal seat, And, born a king, a race of kings beget. Then Procas, honor of \
the Trojan name, Capys, and Numitor, of endless fame. A second Silvius after \
these appears; Silvius Aeneas, for thy name he bears; For arms and justice \
equally renown'd, Who, late restor'd, in Alba shall be crown'd. How great \
they look! how vig'rously they wield Their weighty lances, and sustain the \
shield! But they, who crown'd with oaken wreaths appear, Shall Gabian walls \
and strong Fidena rear; Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found; And raise \
Collatian tow'rs on rocky ground. All these shall then be towns of mighty \
fame, Tho' now they lie obscure, and lands without a name. See Romulus the \
great, born to restore The crown that once his injur'd grandsire wore. This \
prince a priestess of your blood shall bear, And like his sire in arms he \
shall appear. Two rising crests, his royal head adorn; Born from a god, \
himself to godhead born: His sire already signs him for the skies, And marks \
the seat amidst the deities. Auspicious chief! thy race, in times to come, \
Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome- Rome, whose ascending tow'rs \
shall heav'n invade, Involving earth and ocean in her shade; High as the \
Mother of the Gods in place, And proud, like her, of an immortal race. Then, \
when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round, With golden turrets on her temples \
crown'd; A hundred gods her sweeping train supply; Her offspring all, and all \
command the sky. \"Now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see Your Roman \
race, and Julian progeny. The mighty Caesar waits his vital hour, Impatient \
for the world, and grasps his promis'd pow'r. But next behold the youth of \
form divine, Ceasar himself, exalted in his line; Augustus, promis'd oft, and \
long foretold, Sent to the realm that Saturn rul'd of old; Born to restore a \
better age of gold. Afric and India shall his pow'r obey; He shall extend his \
propagated sway Beyond the solar year, without the starry way, Where Atlas \
turns the rolling heav'ns around, And his broad shoulders with their lights \
are crown'd. At his foreseen approach, already quake The Caspian kingdoms and \
Maeotian lake: Their seers behold the tempest from afar, And threat'ning \
oracles denounce the war. Nile hears him knocking at his sev'nfold gates, And \
seeks his hidden spring, and fears his nephew's fates. Nor Hercules more \
lands or labors knew, Not tho' the brazen-footed hind he slew, Freed \
Erymanthus from the foaming boar, And dipp'd his arrows in Lernaean gore; Nor \
Bacchus, turning from his Indian war, By tigers drawn triumphant in his car, \
From Nisus' top descending on the plains, With curling vines around his \
purple reins. And doubt we yet thro' dangers to pursue The paths of honor, \
and a crown in view? But what's the man, who from afar appears? His head with \
olive crown'd, his hand a censer bears, His hoary beard and holy vestments \
bring His lost idea back: I know the Roman king. He shall to peaceful Rome \
new laws ordain, Call'd from his mean abode a scepter to sustain. Him Tullus \
next in dignity succeeds, An active prince, and prone to martial deeds. He \
shall his troops for fighting fields prepare, Disus'd to toils, and triumphs \
of the war. By dint of sword his crown he shall increase, And scour his armor \
from the rust of peace. Whom Ancus follows, with a fawning air, But vain \
within, and proudly popular. Next view the Tarquin kings, th' avenging sword \
Of Brutus, justly drawn, and Rome restor'd. He first renews the rods and ax \
severe, And gives the consuls royal robes to wear. His sons, who seek the \
tyrant to sustain, And long for arbitrary lords again, With ignominy \
scourg'd, in open sight, He dooms to death deserv'd, asserting public right. \
Unhappy man, to break the pious laws Of nature, pleading in his children's \
cause! Howeer the doubtful fact is understood, 'T is love of honor, and his \
country's good: The consul, not the father, sheds the blood. Behold Torquatus \
the same track pursue; And, next, the two devoted Decii view: The Drusian \
line, Camillus loaded home With standards well redeem'd, and foreign foes \
o'ercome The pair you see in equal armor shine, Now, friends below, in close \
embraces join; But, when they leave the shady realms of night, And, cloth'd \
in bodies, breathe your upper light, With mortal hate each other shall \
pursue: What wars, what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue! From Alpine \
heights the father first descends; His daughter's husband in the plain \
attends: His daughter's husband arms his eastern friends. Embrace again, my \
sons, be foes no more; Nor stain your country with her children's gore! And \
thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim, Thou, of my blood, who bearist \
the Julian name! Another comes, who shall in triumph ride, And to the Capitol \
his chariot guide, From conquer'd Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils. And yet \
another, fam'd for warlike toils, On Argos shall impose the Roman laws, And \
on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause; Shall drag in chains their Achillean \
race; Shall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace, And Pallas, for her violated \
place. Great Cato there, for gravity renown'd, And conqu'ring Cossus goes \
with laurels crown'd. Who can omit the Gracchi? who declare The Scipios' \
worth, those thunderbolts of war, The double bane of Carthage? Who can see \
Without esteem for virtuous poverty, Severe Fabricius, or can cease t' admire \
The plowman consul in his coarse attire? Tir'd as I am, my praise the Fabii \
claim; And thou, great hero, greatest of thy name, Ordain'd in war to save \
the sinking state, And, by delays, to put a stop to fate! Let others better \
mold the running mass Of metals, and inform the breathing brass, And soften \
into flesh a marble face; Plead better at the bar; describe the skies, And \
when the stars descend, and when they rise. But, Rome, 't is thine alone, \
with awful sway, To rule mankind, and make the world obey, Disposing peace \
and war by thy own majestic way; To tame the proud, the fetter'd slave to \
free: These are imperial arts, and worthy thee.\" He paus'd; and, while with \
wond'ring eyes they view'd The passing spirits, thus his speech renew'd: \
\"See great Marcellus! how, untir'd in toils, He moves with manly grace, how \
rich with regal spoils! He, when his country, threaten'd with alarms, \
Requires his courage and his conqu'ring arms, Shall more than once the Punic \
bands affright; Shall kill the Gaulish king in single fight; Then to the \
Capitol in triumph move, And the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove.\" \
Aeneas here beheld, of form divine, A godlike youth in glitt'ring armor \
shine, With great Marcellus keeping equal pace; But gloomy were his eyes, \
dejected was his face. He saw, and, wond'ring, ask'd his airy guide, What and \
of whence was he, who press'd the hero's side: \"His son, or one of his \
illustrious name? How like the former, and almost the same! Observe the \
crowds that compass him around; All gaze, and all admire, and raise a \
shouting sound: But hov'ring mists around his brows are spread, And night, \
with sable shades, involves his head.\" \"Seek not to know,\" the ghost \
replied with tears, \"The sorrows of thy sons in future years. This youth \
(the blissful vision of a day) Shall just be shown on earth, and snatch'd \
away. The gods too high had rais'd the Roman state, Were but their gifts as \
permanent as great. What groans of men shall fill the Martian field! How \
fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield! What fun'ral pomp shall floating \
Tiber see, When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity! No youth \
shall equal hopes of glory give, No youth afford so great a cause to grieve; \
The Trojan honor, and the Roman boast, Admir'd when living, and ador'd when \
lost! Mirror of ancient faith in early youth! Undaunted worth, inviolable \
truth! No foe, unpunish'd, in the fighting field Shall dare thee, foot to \
foot, with sword and shield; Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force, \
When thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse. Ah! couldst thou break \
thro' fate's severe decree, A new Marcellus shall arise in thee! Full \
canisters of fragrant lilies bring, Mix'd with the purple roses of the \
spring; Let me with fun'ral flow'rs his body strow; This gift which parents \
to their children owe, This unavailing gift, at least, I may bestow!\" Thus \
having said, he led the hero round The confines of the blest Elysian ground; \
Which when Anchises to his son had shown, And fir'd his mind to mount the \
promis'd throne, He tells the future wars, ordain'd by fate; The strength and \
customs of the Latian state; The prince, and people; and forearms his care \
With rules, to push his fortune, or to bear. Two gates the silent house of \
Sleep adorn; Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn: True visions \
thro' transparent horn arise; Thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies. Of \
various things discoursing as he pass'd, Anchises hither bends his steps at \
last. Then, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd His valiant offspring and \
divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas his way, Embark'd his men, and \
skimm'd along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain'd Cajeta's bay. At length \
on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turn'd to sea, their sterns \
to shore. BOOK VII And thou, O matron of immortal fame, Here dying, to the \
shore hast left thy name; Cajeta still the place is call'd from thee, The \
nurse of great Aeneas' infancy. Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia's \
plains; Thy name ('t is all a ghost can have) remains. Now, when the prince \
her fun'ral rites had paid, He plow'd the Tyrrhene seas with sails display'd. \
From land a gentle breeze arose by night, Serenely shone the stars, the moon \
was bright, And the sea trembled with her silver light. Now near the shelves \
of Circe's shores they run, (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) A \
dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days In joyous songs; the rocks \
resound her lays: In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, And cedar \
brands supply her father's light. From hence were heard, rebellowing to the \
main, The roars of lions that refuse the chain, The grunts of bristled boars, \
and groans of bears, And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears. \
These from their caverns, at the close of night, Fill the sad isle with \
horror and affright. Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r, \
(That watch'd the moon and planetary hour,) With words and wicked herbs from \
humankind Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd. Which monsters lest the \
Trojans' pious host Should bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast, \
Propitious Neptune steer'd their course by night With rising gales that sped \
their happy flight. Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore, And \
hear the swelling surges vainly roar. Now, when the rosy morn began to rise, \
And wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies; When Thetis blush'd in purple \
not her own, And from her face the breathing winds were blown, A sudden \
silence sate upon the sea, And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their \
way. The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood, Which thick with shades and a \
brown horror stood: Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course, With \
whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force, That drove the sand along, he \
took his way, And roll'd his yellow billows to the sea. About him, and above, \
and round the wood, The birds that haunt the borders of his flood, That \
bath'd within, or basked upon his side, To tuneful songs their narrow throats \
applied. The captain gives command; the joyful train Glide thro' the gloomy \
shade, and leave the main. Now, Erato, thy poet's mind inspire, And fill his \
soul with thy celestial fire! Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings; \
Declare the past and state of things, When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia \
sought, And how the rivals lov'd, and how they fought. These are my theme, \
and how the war began, And how concluded by the godlike man: For I shall sing \
of battles, blood, and rage, Which princes and their people did engage; And \
haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate, In fighting fields pursued and \
found their fate; That rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms, And \
peaceful Italy involv'd in arms. A larger scene of action is display'd; And, \
rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd. Latinus, old and mild, had long \
possess'd The Latin scepter, and his people blest: His father Faunus; a \
Laurentian dame His mother; fair Marica was her name. But Faunus came from \
Picus: Picus drew His birth from Saturn, if records be true. Thus King \
Latinus, in the third degree, Had Saturn author of his family. But this old \
peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed, Was blest with no male issue to succeed: \
His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate; One only daughter heir'd \
the royal state. Fir'd with her love, and with ambition led, The neighb'ring \
princes court her nuptial bed. Among the crowd, but far above the rest, Young \
Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd. Turnus, for high descent and graceful \
mien, Was first, and favor'd by the Latian queen; With him she strove to join \
Lavinia's hand, But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand. Deep in the \
palace, of long growth, there stood A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood; Where \
rites divine were paid; whose holy hair Was kept and cut with superstitious \
care. This plant Latinus, when his town he wall'd, Then found, and from the \
tree Laurentum call'd; And last, in honor of his new abode, He vow'd the \
laurel to the laurel's god. It happen'd once (a boding prodigy!) A swarm of \
bees, that cut the liquid sky, (Unknown from whence they took their airy \
flight,) Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight; There with their clasping \
feet together clung, And a long cluster from the laurel hung. An ancient \
augur prophesied from hence: \"Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince! From \
the same parts of heav'n his navy stands, To the same parts on earth; his \
army lands; The town he conquers, and the tow'r commands.\" Yet more, when \
fair Lavinia fed the fire Before the gods, and stood beside her sire, \
(Strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke Of incense, from the \
sacred altar broke, Caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire; Her crown and \
jewels crackled in the fire: From thence the fuming trail began to spread And \
lambent glories danc'd about her head. This new portent the seer with wonder \
views, Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews: \"The nymph, who scatters \
flaming fires around, Shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd; But, \
caus'd by her irrevocable fate, War shall the country waste, and change the \
state.\" Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent, For counsel to his father \
Faunus went, And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy Which near Albunea's \
sulph'rous fountain lie. To these the Latian and the Sabine land Fly, when \
distress'd, and thence relief demand. The priest on skins of off'rings takes \
his ease, And nightly visions in his slumber sees; A swarm of thin aerial \
shapes appears, And, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears: These he \
consults, the future fates to know, From pow'rs above, and from the fiends \
below. Here, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies, Off'ring a hundred sheep \
for sacrifice: Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd, He laid beneath \
him, and to rest retir'd. No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound, When, \
from above, a more than mortal sound Invades his ears; and thus the vision \
spoke: \"Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke Our fair Lavinia, nor the \
gods provoke. A foreign son upon thy shore descends, Whose martial fame from \
pole to pole extends. His race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd, Not \
Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound: 'T is theirs whate'er the sun surveys \
around.\" These answers, in the silent night receiv'd, The king himself \
divulg'd, the land believ'd: The fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew, \
When now the Trojan navy was in view. Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread \
His table on the turf, with cakes of bread; And, with his chiefs, on forest \
fruits he fed. They sate; and, (not without the god's command,) Their homely \
fare dispatch'd, the hungry band Invade their trenchers next, and soon \
devour, To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour. Ascanius this \
observ'd, and smiling said: \"See, we devour the plates on which we fed.\" \
The speech had omen, that the Trojan race Should find repose, and this the \
time and place. Aeneas took the word, and thus replies, Confessing fate with \
wonder in his eyes: \"All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods! Behold \
the destin'd place of your abodes! For thus Anchises prophesied of old, And \
this our fatal place of rest foretold: 'When, on a foreign shore, instead of \
meat, By famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat, Then ease your weary \
Trojans will attend, And the long labors of your voyage end. Remember on that \
happy coast to build, And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.' This was \
that famine, this the fatal place Which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd \
race. Then, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ, To search the land, and \
where the cities lie, And what the men; but give this day to joy. Now pour to \
Jove; and, after Jove is blest, Call great Anchises to the genial feast: \
Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught; Enjoy the present hour; \
adjourn the future thought.\" Thus having said, the hero bound his brows With \
leafy branches, then perform'd his vows; Adoring first the genius of the \
place, Then Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race, The nymphs, and native \
godheads yet unknown, And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable \
throne, And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove, And last his sire below, and \
mother queen above. Then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud, And \
thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud. Soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor \
flew, The time was come their city to renew. Then ev'ry brow with cheerful \
green is crown'd, The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round. When next \
the rosy morn disclos'd the day, The scouts to sev'ral parts divide their \
way, To learn the natives' names, their towns explore, The coasts and \
trendings of the crooked shore: Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands; \
Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands. The pious chief, who sought by \
peaceful ways To found his empire, and his town to raise, A hundred youths \
from all his train selects, And to the Latian court their course directs, \
(The spacious palace where their prince resides,) And all their heads with \
wreaths of olive hides. They go commission'd to require a peace, And carry \
presents to procure access. Thus while they speed their pace, the prince \
designs His new-elected seat, and draws the lines. The Trojans round the \
place a rampire cast, And palisades about the trenches plac'd. Meantime the \
train, proceeding on their way, From far the town and lofty tow'rs survey; At \
length approach the walls. Without the gate, They see the boys and Latian \
youth debate The martial prizes on the dusty plain: Some drive the cars, and \
some the coursers rein; Some bend the stubborn bow for victory, And some with \
darts their active sinews try. A posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence, Of \
this fair troop advis'd their aged prince, That foreign men of mighty stature \
came; Uncouth their habit, and unknown their name. The king ordains their \
entrance, and ascends His regal seat, surrounded by his friends. The palace \
built by Picus, vast and proud, Supported by a hundred pillars stood, And \
round incompass'd with a rising wood. The pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew \
the sight; Surpris'd at once with reverence and delight. There kings receiv'd \
the marks of sov'reign pow'r; In state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore \
Their awful axes and the rods before. Here the tribunal stood, the house of \
pray'r, And here the sacred senators repair; All at large tables, in long \
order set, A ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat. Above the portal, \
carv'd in cedar wood, Plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood; \
Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high; And Italus, that led the \
colony; And ancient Janus, with his double face, And bunch of keys, the \
porter of the place. There good Sabinus, planter of the vines, On a short \
pruning hook his head reclines, And studiously surveys his gen'rous wines; \
Then warlike kings, who for their country fought, And honorable wounds from \
battle brought. Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears, And captive \
chariots, axes, shields, and bars, And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of \
their wars. Above the rest, as chief of all the band, Was Picus plac'd, a \
buckler in his hand; His other wav'd a long divining wand. Girt in his Gabin \
gown the hero sate, Yet could not with his art avoid his fate: For Circe long \
had lov'd the youth in vain, Till love, refus'd, converted to disdain: Then, \
mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art, She chang'd his form, who could not \
change his heart; Constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly, With \
party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie. In this high temple, on a chair of \
state, The seat of audience, old Latinus sate; Then gave admission to the \
Trojan train; And thus with pleasing accents he began: \"Tell me, ye Trojans, \
for that name you own, Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown- Say what \
you seek, and whither were you bound: Were you by stress of weather cast \
aground? (Such dangers as on seas are often seen, And oft befall to miserable \
men,) Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay, Spent and disabled in so \
long a way? Say what you want: the Latians you shall find Not forc'd to \
goodness, but by will inclin'd; For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign, \
His hospitable customs we retain. I call to mind (but time the tale has worn) \
Th' Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho' born On Latian plains, yet sought the \
Phrygian shore, And Samothracia, Samos call'd before. From Tuscan Coritum he \
claim'd his birth; But after, when exempt from mortal earth, From thence \
ascended to his kindred skies, A god, and, as a god, augments their \
sacrifice,\" He said. Ilioneus made this reply: \"O king, of Faunus' royal \
family! Nor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way, Nor did the stars our \
wand'ring course betray. Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound, \
The port, so long desir'd, at length we found; From our sweet homes and \
ancient realms expell'd; Great as the greatest that the sun beheld. The god \
began our line, who rules above; And, as our race, our king descends from \
Jove: And hither are we come, by his command, To crave admission in your \
happy land. How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour'd, Our plains, our temples, \
and our town devour'd; What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms Shook \
Asia's crown with European arms; Ev'n such have heard, if any such there be, \
Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea; And such as, born beneath the \
burning sky And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie. From that dire deluge, \
thro' the wat'ry waste, Such length of years, such various perils past, At \
last escap'd, to Latium we repair, To beg what you without your want may \
spare: The common water, and the common air; Sheds which ourselves will \
build, and mean abodes, Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods. Nor our \
admission shall your realm disgrace, Nor length of time our gratitude efface. \
Besides, what endless honor you shall gain, To save and shelter Troy's \
unhappy train! Now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear, Renown'd for \
faith in peace, for force in war; Oft our alliance other lands desir'd, And, \
what we seek of you, of us requir'd. Despite not then, that in our hands we \
bear These holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r. Fate and the gods, by their \
supreme command, Have doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land. To these \
abodes our fleet Apollo sends; Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends; \
Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force, And where Numicus opes his holy \
source. Besides, our prince presents, with his request, Some small remains of \
what his sire possess'd. This golden charger, snatch'd from burning Troy, \
Anchises did in sacrifice employ; This royal robe and this tiara wore Old \
Priam, and this golden scepter bore In full assemblies, and in solemn games; \
These purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames.\" Thus while he spoke, \
Latinus roll'd around His eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground. Intent he \
seem'd, and anxious in his breast; Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest, \
But pond'ring future things of wondrous weight; Succession, empire, and his \
daughter's fate. On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind, And then \
revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd. This was the foreign prince, by fate \
decreed To share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed; This was the race that sure \
portents foreshew To sway the world, and land and sea subdue. At length he \
rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke: \"The pow'rs,\" said he, \"the pow'rs we \
both invoke, To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be, And firm our purpose \
with their augury! Have what you ask; your presents I receive; Land, where \
and when you please, with ample leave; Partake and use my kingdom as your \
own; All shall be yours, while I command the crown: And, if my wish'd \
alliance please your king, Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring. \
Then let him not a friend's embraces fear; The peace is made when I behold \
him here. Besides this answer, tell my royal guest, I add to his commands my \
own request: One only daughter heirs my crown and state, Whom not our \
oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate, Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join With \
any native of th' Ausonian line. A foreign son-in-law shall come from far \
(Such is our doom), a chief renown'd in war, Whose race shall bear aloft the \
Latian name, And thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame. Himself to be \
the man the fates require, I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire.\" He \
said, and then on each bestow'd a steed. Three hundred horses, in high \
stables fed, Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd: Of these he \
chose the fairest and the best, To mount the Trojan troop. At his command The \
steeds caparison'd with purple stand, With golden trappings, glorious to \
behold, And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold. Then to his absent \
guest the king decreed A pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed, Who from \
their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire; Whom Circe stole from her celestial \
sire, By substituting mares produc'd on earth, Whose wombs conceiv'd a more \
than mortal birth. These draw the chariot which Latinus sends, And the rich \
present to the prince commends. Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, \
To their expecting lord with peace return. But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' \
height, As she from Argos took her airy flight, Beheld with envious eyes this \
hateful sight. She saw the Trojan and his joyful train Descend upon the \
shore, desert the main, Design a town, and, with unhop'd success, Th' \
embassadors return with promis'd peace. Then, pierc'd with pain, she shook \
her haughty head, Sigh'd from her inward soul, and thus she said: \"O hated \
offspring of my Phrygian foes! O fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose! \
Could they not fall unpitied on the plain, But slain revive, and, taken, \
scape again? When execrable Troy in ashes lay, Thro' fires and swords and \
seas they forc'd their way. Then vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend, Her \
rage disarm'd, her empire at an end. Breathless and tir'd, is all my fury \
spent? Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? As if 't were little from \
their town to chase, I thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race; Ingag'd the \
heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main; But billows roar'd, and tempests rag'd in \
vain. What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, When these they overpass, and \
those they shun? On Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate, Triumphant o'er \
the storms and Juno's hate. Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, \
And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath, Who sent the tusky boar to \
Calydon; (What great offense had either people done?) But I, the consort of \
the Thunderer, Have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war, With various arts and \
arms in vain have toil'd, And by a mortal man at length am foil'd. If native \
pow'r prevail not, shall I doubt To seek for needful succor from without? If \
Jove and Heav'n my just desires deny, Hell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove \
supply. Grant that the Fates have firm'd, by their decree, The Trojan race to \
reign in Italy; At least I can defer the nuptial day, And with protracted \
wars the peace delay: With blood the dear alliance shall be bought, And both \
the people near destruction brought; So shall the son-in-law and father join, \
With ruin, war, and waste of either line. O fatal maid, thy marriage is \
endow'd With Phrygian, Latian, andRutulian blood! Bellona leads thee to thy \
lover's hand; Another queen brings forth another brand, To burn with foreign \
fires another land! A second Paris, diff'ring but in name, Shall fire his \
country with a second flame.\" Thus having said, she sinks beneath the \
ground, With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound, To rouse Alecto \
from th' infernal seat Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat. This \
Fury, fit for her intent, she chose; One who delights in wars and human woes. \
Ev'n Pluto hates his own misshapen race; Her sister Furies fly her hideous \
face; So frightful are the forms the monster takes, So fierce the hissings of \
her speckled snakes. Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite: \"O virgin \
daughter of eternal Night, Give me this once thy labor, to sustain My right, \
and execute my just disdain. Let not the Trojans, with a feign'd pretense Of \
proffer'd peace, delude the Latian prince. Expel from Italy that odious name, \
And let not Juno suffer in her fame. 'T is thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a \
state, Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate, And kindle kindred blood \
to mutual hate. Thy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays, And forms a \
thousand ills ten thousand ways. Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the \
seeds Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds: Confound the peace establish'd, \
and prepare Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war.\" Smear'd as she \
was with black Gorgonian blood, The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood; And \
on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night, She to the Latian palace took her \
flight: There sought the queen's apartment, stood before The peaceful \
threshold, and besieg'd the door. Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast \
Fir'd with disdain for Turnus dispossess'd, And the new nuptials of the \
Trojan guest. From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes Her darling plague, \
the fav'rite of her snakes; With her full force she threw the poisonous dart, \
And fix'd it deep within Amata's heart, That, thus envenom'd, she might \
kindle rage, And sacrifice to strife her house husband's age. Unseen, unfelt, \
the fiery serpent skims Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs; His baleful \
breath inspiring, as he glides, Now like a chain around her neck he rides, \
Now like a fillet to her head repairs, And with his circling volumes folds \
her hairs. At first the silent venom slid with ease, And seiz'd her cooler \
senses by degrees; Then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far, In \
plaintive accents she began the war, And thus bespoke her husband: \"Shall,\" \
she said, \"A wand'ring prince enjoy Lavinia's bed? If nature plead not in a \
parent's heart, Pity my tears, and pity her desert. I know, my dearest lord, \
the time will come, You in vain, reverse your cruel doom; The faithless \
pirate soon will set to sea, And bear the royal virgin far away! A guest like \
him, a Trojan guest before, In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore, \
And ravish'd Helen from her husband bore. Think on a king's inviolable word; \
And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord: To this false foreigner you give \
your throne, And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son. Resume your ancient \
care; and, if the god Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood, Know all \
are foreign, in a larger sense, Not born your subjects, or deriv'd from \
hence. Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace, He springs from Inachus of \
Argive race.\" But when she saw her reasons idly spent, And could not move \
him from his fix'd intent, She flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd Her \
vital parts, and poison'd all her breast; She raves, she runs with a \
distracted pace, And fills with horrid howls the public place. And, as young \
striplings whip the top for sport, On the smooth pavement of an empty court; \
The wooden engine flies and whirls about, Admir'd, with clamors, of the \
beardless rout; They lash aloud; each other they provoke, And lend their \
little souls at ev'ry stroke: Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows \
Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes. Nor yet content, she strains her \
malice more, And adds new ills to those contriv'd before: She flies the town, \
and, mixing with a throng Of madding matrons, bears the bride along, \
Wand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways, And with these arts the \
Trojan match delays. She feign'd the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud, And to \
the buxom god the virgin vow'd. \"Evoe! O Bacchus!\" thus began the song; And \
\"Evoe!\" answer'd all the female throng. \"O virgin! worthy thee alone!\" \
she cried; \"O worthy thee alone!\" the crew replied. \"For thee she feeds \
her hair, she leads thy dance, And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance.\" \
Like fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known, All seek the mountains, and \
forsake the town: All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear, Give to the \
wanton winds their flowing hair, And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring \
air. The queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine, Shook high above her head \
a flaming pine; Then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng, And sung, in \
Turnus' name, the nuptial song: \"Io, ye Latian dames! if any here Hold your \
unhappy queen, Amata, dear; If there be here,\" she said, who dare maintain \
My right, nor think the name of mother vain; Unbind your fillets, loose your \
flowing hair, And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare.\" Amata's breast the \
Fury thus invades, And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades; Then, when \
she found her venom spread so far, The royal house embroil'd in civil war, \
Rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies, And seeks the palace where \
young Turnus lies. His town, as fame reports, was built of old By Danae, \
pregnant with almighty gold, Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train Of \
following Argives, thro' the stormy main, Driv'n by the southern blasts, was \
fated here to reign. 'T was Ardua once; now Ardea's name it bears; Once a \
fair city, now consum'd with years. Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay, \
Betwixt the confines of the night and day, Secure in sleep. The Fury laid \
aside Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried The foulness of th' \
infernal form to hide. Propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien: Her \
face is furrow'd, and her front obscene; Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek \
she draws; Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws; Her hoary hair with \
holy fillets bound, Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd. Old \
Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane Of Juno, now she seem'd, and thus began, \
Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man: \"Shall Turnus then such \
endless toil sustain In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain? Win, for \
a Trojan head to wear the prize, Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories? The \
bride and scepter which thy blood has bought, The king transfers; and foreign \
heirs are sought. Go now, deluded man, and seek again New toils, new dangers, \
on the dusty plain. Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize; Protect the \
Latians in luxurious ease. This dream all-pow'rful Juno sends; I bear Her \
mighty mandates, and her words you hear. Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to \
the plain; With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train: Their thoughtless \
chiefs, their painted ships, that lie In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword \
destroy. The Latian king, unless he shall submit, Own his old promise, and \
his new forget- Let him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove, And learn to \
fear whom he disdains to love. For such is Heav'n's command.\" The youthful \
prince With scorn replied, and made this bold defense: \"You tell me, mother, \
what I knew before: The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore. I neither fear \
nor will provoke the war; My fate is Juno's most peculiar care. But time has \
made you dote, and vainly tell Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell. Go; be \
the temple and the gods your care; Permit to men the thought of peace and \
war.\" These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke, And frighted Turnus \
trembled as she spoke. Her eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn; Her \
hideous looks and hellish form return; Her curling snakes with hissings fill \
the place, And open all the furies of her face: Then, darting fire from her \
malignant eyes, She cast him backward as he strove to rise, And, ling'ring, \
sought to frame some new replies. High on her head she rears two twisted \
snakes, Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes; And, churning bloody \
foam, thus loudly speaks: \"Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell Of \
arms imagin'd in her lonely cell! Behold the Fates' infernal minister! War, \
death, destruction, in my hand I bear.\" Thus having said, her smold'ring \
torch, impress'd With her full force, she plung'd into his breast. Aghast he \
wak'd; and, starting from his bed, Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs \
o'erspread. \"Arms! arms!\" he cries: \"my sword and shield prepare!\" He \
breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war. So, when with crackling flames a \
caldron fries, The bubbling waters from the bottom rise: Above the brims they \
force their fiery way; Black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day. The peace \
polluted thus, a chosen band He first commissions to the Latian land, In \
threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest, To meet in arms th' intruding \
Trojan guest, To force the foes from the Lavinian shore, And Italy's \
indanger'd peace restore. Himself alone an equal match he boasts, To fight \
the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts. The gods invok'd, the Rutuli prepare Their \
arms, and warn each other to the war. His beauty these, and those his \
blooming age, The rest his house and his own fame ingage. While Turnus urges \
thus his enterprise, The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies; New frauds \
invents, and takes a steepy stand, Which overlooks the vale with wide \
command; Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train, With horns and hounds, a \
hunting match ordain, And pitch their toils around the shady plain. The Fury \
fires the pack; they snuff, they vent, And feed their hungry nostrils with \
the scent. 'Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise High o'er his \
front; his beams invade the skies. From this light cause th' infernal maid \
prepares The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars. The stately beast \
the two Tyrrhidae bred, Snatch'd from his dams, and the tame youngling fed. \
Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring, Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the \
Latian king: Their sister Silvia cherish'd with her care The little wanton, \
and did wreaths prepare To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied His \
tender neck, and comb'd his silken hide, And bathed his body. Patient of \
command In time he grew, and, growing us'd to hand, He waited at his master's \
board for food; Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood, Where grazing \
all the day, at night he came To his known lodgings, and his country dame. \
This household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds, Was view'd at first by \
the young hero's hounds, As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat In the \
cool waters, and to quench his heat. Ascanius young, and eager of his game, \
Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim; But the dire fiend the fatal arrow \
guides, Which pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides. The bleeding \
creature issues from the floods, Possess'd with fear, and seeks his known \
abodes, His old familiar hearth and household gods. He falls; he fills the \
house with heavy groans, Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans. Young \
Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud For succor from the clownish \
neighborhood: The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay In the close woody \
covert, urg'd their way. One with a brand yet burning from the flame, Arm'd \
with a knotty club another came: Whate'er they catch or find, without their \
care, Their fury makes an instrument of war. Tyrrheus, the foster father of \
the beast, Then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist, But held his hand from \
the descending stroke, And left his wedge within the cloven oak, To whet \
their courage and their rage provoke. And now the goddess, exercis'd in ill, \
Who watch'd an hour to work her impious will, Ascends the roof, and to her \
crooked horn, Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne, Adds all her \
breath: the rocks and woods around, And mountains, tremble at th' infernal \
sound. The sacred lake of Trivia from afar, The Veline fountains, and \
sulphureous Nar, Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war. Young \
mothers wildly stare, with fear possess'd, And strain their helpless infants \
to their breast. The clowns, a boist'rous, rude, ungovern'd crew, With \
furious haste to the loud summons flew. The pow'rs of Troy, then issuing on \
the plain, With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain: Not theirs a raw \
and unexperienc'd train, But a firm body of embattled men. At first, while \
fortune favor'd neither side, The fight with clubs and burning brands was \
tried; But now, both parties reinforc'd, the fields Are bright with flaming \
swords and brazen shields. A shining harvest either host displays, And shoots \
against the sun with equal rays. Thus, when a black-brow'd gust begins to \
rise, White foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries; Then roars the main, the \
billows mount the skies; Till, by the fury of the storm full blown, The muddy \
bottom o'er the clouds is thrown. First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest \
care, Pierc'd with an arrow from the distant war: Fix'd in his throat the \
flying weapon stood, And stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital blood Huge \
heaps of slain around the body rise: Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies; A \
good old man, while peace he preach'd in vain, Amidst the madness of th' \
unruly train: Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill'd; His \
lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd. Thus, while in equal scales their \
fortune stood The Fury bath'd them in each other's blood; Then, having fix'd \
the fight, exulting flies, And bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies. To \
Juno thus she speaks: \"Behold! It is done, The blood already drawn, the war \
begun; The discord is complete; nor can they cease The dire debate, nor you \
command the peace. Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood Have tasted \
vengeance and the sweets of blood; Speak, and my pow'r shall add this office \
more: The neighb'ing nations of th' Ausonian shore Shall hear the dreadful \
rumor, from afar, Of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war.\" Then Juno thus: \
\"The grateful work is done, The seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun; \
Frauds, fears, and fury have possess'd the state, And fix'd the causes of a \
lasting hate. A bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join Betwixt the Trojan and \
Ausonian line: But thou with speed to night and hell repair; For not the \
gods, nor angry Jove, will bear Thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air. \
Leave what remains to me.\" Saturnia said: The sullen fiend her sounding \
wings display'd, Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade. In \
midst of Italy, well known to fame, There lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name) \
Below the lofty mounts: on either side Thick forests the forbidden entrance \
hide. Full in the center of the sacred wood An arm arises of the Stygian \
flood, Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound, Whirls the black \
waves and rattling stones around. Here Pluto pants for breath from out his \
cell, And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell. To this infernal lake the \
Fury flies; Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring skies. \
Saturnian Juno now, with double care, Attends the fatal process of the war. \
The clowns, return'd, from battle bear the slain, Implore the gods, and to \
their king complain. The corps of Almon and the rest are shown; Shrieks, \
clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town. Ambitious Turnus in the press \
appears, And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears; Proclaims his private \
injuries aloud, A solemn promise made, and disavow'd; A foreign son is \
sought, and a mix'd mungril brood. Then they, whose mothers, frantic with \
their fear, In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear, And lead his dances \
with dishevel'd hair, Increase the clamor, and the war demand, (Such was \
Amata's interest in the land,) Against the public sanctions of the peace, \
Against all omens of their ill success. With fates averse, the rout in arms \
resort, To force their monarch, and insult the court. But, like a rock \
unmov'd, a rock that braves The raging tempest and the rising waves- Propp'd \
on himself he stands; his solid sides Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding \
tides- So stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long Sustain'd the madness of \
the noisy throng. But, when he found that Juno's pow'r prevail'd, And all the \
methods of cool counsel fail'd, He calls the gods to witness their offense, \
Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence. \"Hurried by fate,\" he cries, \
\"and borne before A furious wind, we have the faithful shore. O more than \
madmen! you yourselves shall bear The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war: \
Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate, And pray to Heav'n for peace, but \
pray too late. For me, my stormy voyage at an end, I to the port of death \
securely tend. The fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay, Is all I want, \
and all you take away.\" He said no more, but, in his walls confin'd, Shut \
out the woes which he too well divin'd Nor with the rising storm would vainly \
strive, But left the helm, and let the vessel drive. A solemn custom was \
observ'd of old, Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold, Their standard \
when in fighting fields they rear Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare \
The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war; Or from the boasting Parthians would \
regain Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain. Two gates of steel (the \
name of Mars they bear, And still are worship'd with religious fear) Before \
his temple stand: the dire abode, And the fear'd issues of the furious god, \
Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates, The wary guardian Janus \
doubly waits. Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars, The Roman consul \
their decree declares, And in his robes the sounding gates unbars. The youth \
in military shouts arise, And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies. \
These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd, Were the king's office; but \
the king refus'd, Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar Of sacred \
peace, or loose th' imprison'd war; But hid his head, and, safe from loud \
alarms, Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms. Then heav'n's imperious queen \
shot down from high: At her approach the brazen hinges fly; The gates are \
forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar; And, like a tempest, issues out the war. The \
peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore, Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd \
before, Are all on fire; and some, with studious care, Their restiff steeds \
in sandy plains prepare; Some their soft limbs in painful marches try, And \
war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry. Part scour the rusty shields \
with seam; and part New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart: With joy \
they view the waving ensigns fly, And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the \
sky. Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs, Antemnae, Tibur with \
her lofty tow'rs, Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town: All these of old \
were places of renown. Some hammer helmets for the fighting field; Some twine \
young sallows to support the shield; The croslet some, and some the cuishes \
mold, With silver plated, and with ductile gold. The rustic honors of the \
scythe and share Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war. Old \
fauchions are new temper'd in the fires; The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul \
inspires. The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace The shining \
headpiece, and the shield embrace. The neighing steeds are to the chariot \
tied; The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side. And now the mighty labor is begun \
Ye Muses, open all your Helicon. Sing you the chiefs that sway'd th' Ausonian \
land, Their arms, and armies under their command; What warriors in our \
ancient clime were bred; What soldiers follow'd, and what heroes led. For \
well you know, and can record alone, What fame to future times conveys but \
darkly down. Mezentius first appear'd upon the plain: Scorn sate upon his \
brows, and sour disdain, Defying earth and heav'n. Etruria lost, He brings to \
Turnus' aid his baffled host. The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire, \
Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire; To Turnus only second in the \
grace Of manly mien, and features of the face. A skilful horseman, and a \
huntsman bred, With fates averse a thousand men he led: His sire unworthy of \
so brave a son; Himself well worthy of a happier throne. Next Aventinus \
drives his chariot round The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown'd. \
Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field; His father's hydra fills his \
ample shield: A hundred serpents hiss about the brims; The son of Hercules he \
justly seems By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs; Of heav'nly part, and \
part of earthly blood, A mortal woman mixing with a god. For strong Alcides, \
after he had slain The triple Geryon, drove from conquer'd Spain His captive \
herds; and, thence in triumph led, On Tuscan Tiber's flow'ry banks they fed. \
Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove The priestess Rhea found, and forc'd \
to love. For arms, his men long piles and jav'lins bore; And poles with \
pointed steel their foes in battle gore. Like Hercules himself his son \
appears, In salvage pomp; a lion's hide he wears; About his shoulders hangs \
the shaggy skin; The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin. Thus, like the god \
his father, homely dress'd, He strides into the hall, a horrid guest. Then \
two twin brothers from fair Tibur came, (Which from their brother Tiburs took \
the name,) Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear: Arm'd Argive horse they \
led, and in the front appear. Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's \
height With rapid course descending to the fight; They rush along; the \
rattling woods give way; The branches bend before their sweepy sway. Nor was \
Praeneste's founder wanting there, Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber: \
Found in the fire, and foster'd in the plains, A shepherd and a king at once \
he reigns, And leads to Turnus' aid his country swains. His own Praeneste \
sends a chosen band, With those who plow Saturnia's Gabine land; Besides the \
succor which cold Anien yields, The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields, \
Anagnia fat, and Father Amasene- A num'rous rout, but all of naked men: Nor \
arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield, Nor drive the chariot thro' \
the dusty field, But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead, And \
spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head; The left foot naked, when they \
march to fight, But in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right. Messapus \
next, (great Neptune was his sire,) Secure of steel, and fated from the fire, \
In pomp appears, and with his ardor warms A heartless train, unexercis'd in \
arms: The just Faliscans he to battle brings, And those who live where Lake \
Ciminia springs; And where Feronia's grove and temple stands, Who till \
Fescennian or Flavinian lands. All these in order march, and marching sing \
The warlike actions of their sea-born king; Like a long team of snowy swans \
on high, Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky, When, homeward \
from their wat'ry pastures borne, They sing, and Asia's lakes their notes \
return. Not one who heard their music from afar, Would think these troops an \
army train'd to war, But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar, With \
their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore. Then Clausus came, who led a \
num'rous band Of troops embodied from the Sabine land, And, in himself alone, \
an army brought. 'T was he, the noble Claudian race begot, The Claudian race, \
ordain'd, in times to come, To share the greatness of imperial Rome. He led \
the Cures forth, of old renown, Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town, And \
all th' Eretian pow'rs; besides a band That follow'd from Velinum's dewy \
land, And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame, And mountaineers, that from \
Severus came, And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica, And those where yellow \
Tiber takes his way, And where Himella's wanton waters play. Casperia sends \
her arms, with those that lie By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli: The warlike \
aids of Horta next appear, And the cold Nursians come to close the rear, \
Mix'd with the natives born of Latine blood, Whom Allia washes with her fatal \
flood. Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main, When pale Orion sets in \
wintry rain; Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise, Or Lycian fields, when \
Phoebus burns the skies, Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around; \
Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground. High in his \
chariot then Halesus came, A foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name: From \
Agamemnon born- to Turnus' aid A thousand men the youthful hero led, Who till \
the Massic soil, for wine renown'd, And fierce Auruncans from their hilly \
ground, And those who live by Sidicinian shores, And where with shoaly fords \
Vulturnus roars, Cales' and Osca's old inhabitants, And rough Saticulans, \
inur'd to wants: Light demi-lances from afar they throw, Fasten'd with \
leathern thongs, to gall the foe. Short crooked swords in closer fight they \
wear; And on their warding arm light bucklers bear. Nor Oebalus, shalt thou \
be left unsung, From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung, Who then in \
Teleboan Capri reign'd; But that short isle th' ambitious youth disdain'd, \
And o'er Campania stretch'd his ample sway, Where swelling Sarnus seeks the \
Tyrrhene sea; O'er Batulum, and where Abella sees, From her high tow'rs, the \
harvest of her trees. And these (as was the Teuton use of old) Wield brazen \
swords, and brazen bucklers hold; Sling weighty stones, when from afar they \
fight; Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light. Next these in \
rank, the warlike Ufens went, And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent. \
The rude Equicolae his rule obey'd; Hunting their sport, and plund'ring was \
their trade. In arms they plow'd, to battle still prepar'd: Their soil was \
barren, and their hearts were hard. Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians \
led, By King Archippus sent to Turnus' aid, And peaceful olives crown'd his \
hoary head. His wand and holy words, the viper's rage, And venom'd wounds of \
serpents could assuage. He, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep \
Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep. But vain were Marsian \
herbs, and magic art, To cure the wound giv'n by the Dardan dart: Yet his \
untimely fate th' Angitian woods In sighs remurmur'd to the Fucine floods. \
The son of fam'd Hippolytus was there, Fam'd as his sire, and, as his mother, \
fair; Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore, And nurs'd his youth along the \
marshy shore, Where great Diana's peaceful altars flame, In fruitful fields; \
and Virbius was his name. Hippolytus, as old records have said, Was by his \
stepdam sought to share her bed; But, when no female arts his mind could \
move, She turn'd to furious hate her impious love. Torn by wild horses on the \
sandy shore, Another's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore, Glutting his father's \
eyes with guiltless gore. But chaste Diana, who his death deplor'd, With \
Aesculapian herbs his life restor'd. Then Jove, who saw from high, with just \
disdain, The dead inspir'd with vital breath again, Struck to the center, \
with his flaming dart, Th' unhappy founder of the godlike art. But Trivia \
kept in secret shades alone Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown; And call'd \
him Virbius in th' Egerian grove, Where then he liv'd obscure, but safe from \
Jove. For this, from Trivia's temple and her wood Are coursers driv'n, who \
shed their master's blood, Affrighted by the monsters of the flood. His son, \
the second Virbius, yet retain'd His father's art, and warrior steeds he \
rein'd. Amid the troops, and like the leading god, High o'er the rest in arms \
the graceful Turnus rode: A triple of plumes his crest adorn'd, On which with \
belching flames Chimaera burn'd: The more the kindled combat rises high'r, \
The more with fury burns the blazing fire. Fair Io grac'd his shield; but Io \
now With horns exalted stands, and seems to low- A noble charge! Her keeper \
by her side, To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied; And on the brims \
her sire, the wat'ry god, Roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood. A cloud \
of foot succeeds, and fills the fields With swords, and pointed spears, and \
clatt'ring shields; Of Argives, and of old Sicanian bands, And those who plow \
the rich Rutulian lands; Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields, And the \
proud Labicans, with painted shields, And those who near Numician streams \
reside, And those whom Tiber's holy forests hide, Or Circe's hills from the \
main land divide; Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands, Or the black \
water of Pomptina stands. Last, from the Volscians fair Camilla came, And led \
her warlike troops, a warrior dame; Unbred to spinning, in the loom \
unskill'd, She chose the nobler Pallas of the field. Mix'd with the first, \
the fierce virago fought, Sustain'd the toils of arms, the danger sought, \
Outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain, Flew o'er the fields, nor hurt \
the bearded grain: She swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along, Her flying \
feet unbath'd on billows hung. Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise, \
Where'er she passes, fix their wond'ring eyes: Longing they look, and, gaping \
at the sight, Devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight; Her purple habit \
sits with such a grace On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face; Her \
head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd, And in a golden caul the curls are \
bound. She shakes her myrtle jav'lin; and, behind, Her Lycian quiver dances \
in the wind. BOOK VIII When Turnus had assembled all his pow'rs, His standard \
planted on Laurentum's tow'rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had \
giv'n the signal of approaching war, Had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour \
the fields, While the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields; Trembling \
with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th' allies, and headlong rush to \
war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who \
blasphem'd aloud. These thro' the country took their wasteful course, The \
fields to forage, and to gather force. Then Venulus to Diomede they send, To \
beg his aid Ausonia to defend, Declare the common danger, and inform The \
Grecian leader of the growing storm: Aeneas, landed on the Latian coast, With \
banish'd gods, and with a baffled host, Yet now aspir'd to conquest of the \
state, And claim'd a title from the gods and fate; What num'rous nations in \
his quarrel came, And how they spread his formidable name. What he design'd, \
what mischief might arise, If fortune favor'd his first enterprise, Was left \
for him to weigh, whose equal fears, And common interest, was involv'd in \
theirs. While Turnus and th' allies thus urge the war, The Trojan, floating \
in a flood of care, Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare. This way and \
that he turns his anxious mind; Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd; \
Explores himself in vain, in ev'ry part, And gives no rest to his distracted \
heart. So, when the sun by day, or moon by night, Strike on the polish'd \
brass their trembling light, The glitt'ring species here and there divide, \
And cast their dubious beams from side to side; Now on the walls, now on the \
pavement play, And to the ceiling flash the glaring day. 'T was night; and \
weary nature lull'd asleep The birds of air, and fishes of the deep, And \
beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief Was laid on Tiber's banks, oppress'd \
with grief, And found in silent slumber late relief. Then, thro' the shadows \
of the poplar wood, Arose the father of the Roman flood; An azure robe was \
o'er his body spread, A wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head: Thus, \
manifest to sight, the god appear'd, And with these pleasing words his sorrow \
cheer'd: \"Undoubted offspring of ethereal race, O long expected in this \
promis'd place! Who thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods, Restor'd \
them to their hearths, and old abodes; This is thy happy home, the clime \
where fate Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state. Fear not! The war shall \
end in lasting peace, And all the rage of haughty Juno cease. And that this \
nightly vision may not seem Th' effect of fancy, or an idle dream, A sow \
beneath an oak shall lie along, All white herself, and white her thirty \
young. When thirty rolling years have run their race, Thy son Ascanius, on \
this empty space, Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame, Which from this \
omen shall receive the name. Time shall approve the truth. For what remains, \
And how with sure success to crown thy pains, With patience next attend. A \
banish'd band, Driv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land, Have planted here, \
and plac'd on high their walls; Their town the founder Pallanteum calls, \
Deriv'd from Pallas, his great-grandsire's name: But the fierce Latians old \
possession claim, With war infesting the new colony. These make thy friends, \
and on their aid rely. To thy free passage I submit my streams. Wake, son of \
Venus, from thy pleasing dreams; And, when the setting stars are lost in day, \
To Juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay; With sacrifice the wrathful queen \
appease: Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease. When thou return'st \
victorious from the war, Perform thy vows to me with grateful care. The god \
am I, whose yellow water flows Around these fields, and fattens as it goes: \
Tiber my name; among the rolling floods Renown'd on earth, esteem'd among the \
gods. This is my certain seat. In times to come, My waves shall wash the \
walls of mighty Rome.\" He said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke, His \
dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook. He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies \
With purple blushing, and the day arise. Then water in his hollow palm he \
took From Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke: \"Laurentian nymphs, by \
whom the streams are fed, And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed Receive Aeneas, \
and from danger keep. Whatever fount, whatever holy deep, Conceals thy wat'ry \
stores; where'er they rise, And, bubbling from below, salute the skies; Thou, \
king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn Suffices fatness to the fruitful \
corn, For this thy kind compassion of our woes, Shalt share my morning song \
and ev'ning vows. But, O be present to thy people's aid, And firm the \
gracious promise thou hast made!\" Thus having said, two galleys from his \
stores, With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars. Now on the shore the \
fatal swine is found. Wondrous to tell!- She lay along the ground: Her \
well-fed offspring at her udders hung; She white herself, and white her \
thirty young. Aeneas takes the mother and her brood, And all on Juno's altar \
are bestow'd. The foll'wing night, and the succeeding day, Propitious Tiber \
smooth'd his wat'ry way: He roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood, A \
gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood. The Trojans mount their ships; they \
put from shore, Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. Shouts from the \
land give omen to their course, And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy \
force. The woods and waters wonder at the gleam Of shields, and painted ships \
that stem the stream. One summer's night and one whole day they pass Betwixt \
the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass. The fiery sun had finish'd \
half his race, Look'd back, and doubted in the middle space, When they from \
far beheld the rising tow'rs, The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs, \
Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay, Now rise in marble, from the \
Roman sway. These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor) The Trojan saw, and \
turn'd his ships to shore. 'T was on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states, The \
king and prince, without the city gates, Then paid their off'rings in a \
sacred grove To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove. Thick clouds of rolling \
smoke involve the skies, And fat of entrails on his altar fries. But, when \
they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood, And glitter'd thro' the covert of \
the wood, They rose with fear, and left th' unfinish'd feast, Till dauntless \
Pallas reassur'd the rest To pay the rites. Himself without delay A jav'lin \
seiz'd, and singly took his way; Then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from \
far: \"Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are; Your bus'ness here; \
and bring you peace or war?\" High on the stern Aeneas his stand, And held a \
branch of olive in his hand, While thus he spoke: \"The Phrygians' arms you \
see, Expell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy By Latian foes, with war unjustly \
made; At first affianc'd, and at last betray'd. This message bear: 'The \
Trojans and their chief Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.' Struck \
with so great a name, and all on fire, The youth replies: \"Whatever you \
require, Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend. A welcome guest, and, \
what you wish, a friend.\" He said, and, downward hasting to the strand, \
Embrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand. Conducted to the grove, \
Aeneas broke The silence first, and thus the king bespoke: \"Best of the \
Greeks, to whom, by fate's command, I bear these peaceful branches in my \
hand, Undaunted I approach you, tho' I know Your birth is Grecian, and your \
land my foe; From Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came, And both the brother \
kings your kindred claim; Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown, \
Your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown, Our fathers' mingled blood, \
Apollo's voice, Have led me hither, less by need than choice. Our founder \
Dardanus, as fame has sung, And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung: \
Electra from the loins of Atlas came; Atlas, whose head sustains the starry \
frame. Your sire is Mercury, whom long before On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia \
bore. Maia the fair, on fame if we rely, Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains \
the sky. Thus from one common source our streams divide; Ours is the Trojan, \
yours th' Areadian side. Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before, Nor \
ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore; But come, without a pledge, my \
own ambassador. The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue The Trojan race, are \
equal foes to you. Our host expell'd, what farther force can stay The victor \
troops from universal sway? Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the \
land, And either sea from side to side command. Receive our offer'd faith, \
and give us thine; Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line: We want not \
hearts nor bodies for the war; In council cautious, and in fields we dare.\" \
He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes Evander view'd the man with vast \
surprise, Pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face: Then answer'd \
briefly, with a royal grace: \"O valiant leader of the Trojan line, In whom \
the features of thy father shine, How I recall Anchises! how I see His \
motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee! Long tho' it be, 't is fresh \
within my mind, When Priam to his sister's court design'd A welcome visit, \
with a friendly stay, And thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way. Then, past \
a boy, the callow down began To shade my chin, and call me first a man. I saw \
the shining train with vast delight, And Priam's goodly person pleas'd my \
sight: But great Anchises, far above the rest, With awful wonder fir'd my \
youthful breast. I long'd to join in friendship's holy bands Our mutual \
hearts, and plight our mutual hands. I first accosted him: I sued, I sought, \
And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought. He gave me, when at length \
constrain'd to go, A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow, A vest embroider'd, \
glorious to behold, And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold, Which my \
son's coursers in obedience hold. The league you ask, I offer, as your right; \
And, when to-morrow's sun reveals the light, With swift supplies you shall be \
sent away. Now celebrate with us this solemn day, Whose holy rites admit no \
long delay. Honor our annual feast; and take your seat, With friendly \
welcome, at a homely treat.\" Thus having said, the bowls (remov'd for fear) \
The youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer. On sods of turf he set the \
soldiers round: A maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground, Receiv'd the \
Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed, A lion's shaggy hide for ornament they \
spread. The loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine In bowls; the priest \
renew'd the rites divine: Broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's \
continued chine. But when the rage of hunger was repress'd, Thus spoke \
Evander to his royal guest: \"These rites, these altars, and this feast, O \
king, From no vain fears or superstition spring, Or blind devotion, or from \
blinder chance, Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance; But, sav'd from danger, \
with a grateful sense, The labors of a god we recompense. See, from afar, yon \
rock that mates the sky, About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie; Such \
indigested ruin; bleak and bare, How desart now it stands, expos'd in air! 'T \
was once a robber's den, inclos'd around With living stone, and deep beneath \
the ground. The monster Cacus, more than half a beast, This hold, impervious \
to the sun, possess'd. The pavement ever foul with human gore; Heads, and \
their mangled members, hung the door. Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his \
sire, Black clouds he belch'd, and flakes of livid fire. Time, long expected, \
eas'd us of our load, And brought the needful presence of a god. Th' avenging \
force of Hercules, from Spain, Arriv'd in triumph, from Geryon slain: Thrice \
liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain. His prize, the lowing herds, \
Alcides drove Near Tiber's bank, to graze the shady grove. Allur'd with hope \
of plunder, and intent By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent, The brutal \
Cacus, as by chance they stray'd, Four oxen thence, and four fair kine \
convey'd; And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen, He dragg'd 'em \
backwards to his rocky den. The tracks averse a lying notice gave, And led \
the searcher backward from the cave. \"Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his \
place, To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass. The beasts, who miss'd \
their mates, fill'd all around With bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the \
sound. One heifer, who had heard her love complain, Roar'd from the cave, and \
made the project vain. Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook, And \
toss'd about his head his knotted oak. Swift as the winds, or Scythian \
arrows' flight, He clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial height. Then first we \
saw the monster mend his pace; Fear his eyes, and paleness in his face, \
Confess'd the god's approach. Trembling he springs, As terror had increas'd \
his feet with wings; Nor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw His \
body, on his back the door he drew (The door, a rib of living rock; with \
pains His father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains): He broke the \
heavy links, the mountain clos'd, And bars and levers to his foe oppos'd. The \
wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast; The fierce avenger came with \
bounding haste; Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold, And here and there \
his raging eyes he roll'd. He gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd \
round With winged speed the circuit of the ground. Thrice at the cavern's \
mouth he pull'd in vain, And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain. A \
pointed flinty rock, all bare and black, Grew gibbous from behind the \
mountain's back; Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night, Here built their \
nests, and hither wing'd their flight. The leaning head hung threat'ning o'er \
the flood, And nodded to the left. The hero stood Adverse, with planted feet, \
and, from the right, Tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might. Thus \
heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock Gave way; heav'n echo'd at the \
rattling shock. Tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side The banks leap \
backward, and the streams divide; The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread, \
And trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed. The court of Cacus stands reveal'd \
to sight; The cavern glares with new-admitted light. So the pent vapors, with \
a rumbling sound, Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground; A sounding \
flaw succeeds; and, from on high, The gods with hate beheld the nether sky: \
The ghosts repine at violated night, And curse th' invading sun, and sicken \
at the sight. The graceless monster, caught in open day, Inclos'd, and in \
despair to fly away, Howls horrible from underneath, and fills His hollow \
palace with unmanly yells. The hero stands above, and from afar Plies him \
with darts, and stones, and distant war. He, from his nostrils huge mouth, \
expires Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires, Gath'ring, with \
each repeated blast, the night, To make uncertain aim, and erring sight. The \
wrathful god then plunges from above, And, where in thickest waves the \
sparkles drove, There lights; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his way, Half \
sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey. The monster, spewing fruitless \
flames, he found; He squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around, And in \
a knot his crippled members bound; Then from their sockets tore his burning \
eyes: Roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies. The doors, unbarr'd, \
receive the rushing day, And thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey. The \
bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again. Next, by the feet, they drag him \
from his den. The wond'ring neighborhood, with glad surprise, Behold his \
shagged breast, his giant size, His mouth that flames no more, and his \
extinguish'd eyes. From that auspicious day, with rites divine, We worship at \
the hero's holy shrine. Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows: As \
priests, were added the Pinarian house, Who rais'd this altar in the sacred \
shade, Where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid. For these deserts, and \
this high virtue shown, Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown: \
Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood, And with deep draughts invoke \
our common god.\" This said, a double wreath Evander twin'd, And poplars \
black and white his temples bind. Then brims his ample bowl. With like design \
The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine. Meantime the sun descended \
from the skies, And the bright evening star began to rise. And now the \
priests, Potitius at their head, In skins of beasts involv'd, the long \
procession led; Held high the flaming tapers in their hands, As custom had \
prescrib'd their holy bands; Then with a second course the tables load, And \
with full chargers offer to the god. The Salii sing, and cense his altars \
round With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound- One choir of old, \
another of the young, To dance, and bear the burthen of the song. The lay \
records the labors, and the praise, And all th' immortal acts of Hercules: \
First, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands, The serpents strangled \
with his infant hands; Then, as in years and matchless force he grew, Th' \
Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew. Besides, a thousand hazards they \
relate, Procur'd by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate: \"Thy hands, unconquer'd \
hero, could subdue The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew: Nor thy \
resistless arm the bull withstood, Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood. \
The triple porter of the Stygian seat, With lolling tongue, lay fawning at \
thy feet, And, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat. Th' infernal waters \
trembled at thy sight; Thee, god, no face of danger could affright; Not huge \
Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake, Increas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's \
lake. Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace To heav'n and the great \
author of thy race! Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay, And smile \
propitious on thy solemn day!\" In numbers thus they sung; above the rest, \
The den and death of Cacus crown the feast. The woods to hollow vales convey \
the sound, The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound. The rites \
perform'd, the cheerful train retire. Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire, \
The Trojan pass'd, the city to survey, And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious \
way. The stranger cast around his curious eyes, New objects viewing still, \
with new surprise; With greedy joy enquires of various things, And acts and \
monuments of ancient kings. Then thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs: \
\"These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs, Of Nymphs and Fauns, and \
salvage men, who took Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak. Nor \
laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care Of lab'ring oxen, or the shining \
share, Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare. Their exercise the \
chase; the running flood Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their \
food. Then Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove, Robb'd of his realms, and \
banish'd from above. The men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought, And \
laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught, And Latium call'd the land where \
safe he lay From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway. With his mild \
empire, peace and plenty came; And hence the golden times deriv'd their name. \
A more degenerate and discolor'd age Succeeded this, with avarice and rage. \
Th' Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came; And Saturn's empire often \
chang'd the name. Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest, With arbitrary \
sway the land oppress'd: For Tiber's flood was Albula before, Till, from the \
tyrant's fate, his name it bore. I last arriv'd, driv'n from my native home \
By fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom. Long toss'd on seas, I sought \
this happy land, Warn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's command.\" \
Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate, Since call'd Carmental by \
the Roman state; Where stood an altar, sacred to the name Of old Carmenta, \
the prophetic dame, Who to her son foretold th' Aenean race, Sublime in fame, \
and Rome's imperial place: Then shews the forest, which, in after times, \
Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes A sacred refuge made; with this, the \
shrine Where Pan below the rock had rites divine: Then tells of Argus' death, \
his murder'd guest, Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest. Thence, to the \
steep Tarpeian rock he leads; Now roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely \
reeds. A reverent fear (such superstition reigns Among the rude) ev'n then \
possess'd the swains. Some god, they knew- what god, they could not tell- Did \
there amidst the sacred horror dwell. Th' Arcadians thought him Jove; and \
said they saw The mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe, Who took his shield, \
and dealt his bolts around, And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground. \
Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood Two stately towns, on either \
side the flood,) Saturnia's and Janicula's remains; And either place the \
founder's name retains. Discoursing thus together, they resort Where poor \
Evander kept his country court. They view'd the ground of Rome's litigious \
hall; (Once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;) Then, stooping, thro' \
the narrow gate they press'd, When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest: \
\"Mean as it is, this palace, and this door, Receiv'd Alcides, then a \
conqueror. Dare to be poor; accept our homely food, Which feasted him, and \
emulate a god.\" Then underneath a lowly roof he led The weary prince, and \
laid him on a bed; The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread. Now \
Night had shed her silver dews around, And with her sable wings embrac'd the \
ground, When love's fair goddess, anxious for her son, (New tumults rising, \
and new wars begun,) Couch'd with her husband in his golden bed, With these \
alluring words invokes his aid; And, that her pleasing speech his mind may \
move, Inspires each accent with the charms of love: \"While cruel fate \
conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs, To level with the ground the Trojan tow'rs, I \
ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore, Nor did the succor of thy skill \
implore; Nor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain, A sinking empire longer to \
sustain, Tho'much I ow'd to Priam's house, and more The dangers of Aeneas did \
deplore. But now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree, His race is doom'd to \
reign in Italy: With humble suit I beg thy needful art, O still propitious \
pow'r, that rules my heart! A mother kneels a suppliant for her son. By \
Thetis and Aurora thou wert won To forge impenetrable shields, and grace With \
fated arms a less illustrious race. Behold, what haughty nations are combin'd \
Against the relics of the Phrygian kind, With fire and sword my people to \
destroy, And conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy.\" She said; and \
straight her arms, of snowy hue, About her unresolving husband threw. Her \
soft embraces soon infuse desire; His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire; \
And all the godhead feels the wonted fire. Not half so swift the rattling \
thunder flies, Or forky lightnings flash along the skies. The goddess, proud \
of her successful wiles, And conscious of her form, in secret smiles. Then \
thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms, Panting, and half dissolving in her \
arms: \"Why seek you reasons for a cause so just, Or your own beauties or my \
love distrust? Long since, had you requir'd my helpful hand, Th' artificer \
and art you might command, To labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate, \
Confin'd their empire to so short a date. And, if you now desire new wars to \
wage, My skill I promise, and my pains engage. Whatever melting metals can \
conspire, Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire, Is freely yours: your \
anxious fears remove, And think no task is difficult to love.\" Trembling he \
spoke; and, eager of her charms, He snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms; \
Till in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd Of full desire, and sunk to \
pleasing rest. Now when the Night her middle race had rode, And his first \
slumber had refresh'd the god- The time when early housewives leave the bed; \
When living embers on the hearth they spread, Supply the lamp, and call the \
maids to rise- With yawning mouths, and with half-open'd eyes, They ply the \
distaff by the winking light, And to their daily labor add the night: Thus \
frugally they earn their children's bread, And uncorrupted keep the nuptial \
bed- Not less concern'd, nor at a later hour, Rose from his downy couch the \
forging pow'r. Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay, Betwixt Sicilia's \
coasts and Lipare, Rais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below, In hollow \
caves the fires of Aetna glow. The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal; \
Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel, Are heard around; the boiling \
waters roar, And smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar. Hether the Father of \
the Fire, by night, Thro' the brown air precipitates his flight. On their \
eternal anvils here he found The brethren beating, and the blows go round. A \
load of pointless thunder now there lies Before their hands, to ripen for the \
skies: These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast; Consum'd on mortals with \
prodigious waste. Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more, Of winged \
southern winds and cloudy store As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame; \
And fears are added, and avenging flame. Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair \
His broken axletrees and blunted war, And send him forth again with furbish'd \
arms, To wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms. The rest refresh the \
scaly snakes that fold The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold. Full on \
the crest the Gorgon's head they place, With eyes that roll in death, and \
with distorted face. \"My sons,\" said Vulcan, \"set your tasks aside; Your \
strength and master-skill must now be tried. Arms for a hero forge; arms that \
require Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire.\" He said. They \
set their former work aside, And their new toils with eager haste divide. A \
flood of molten silver, brass, and gold, And deadly steel, in the large \
furnace roll'd; Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare, Alone \
sufficient to sustain the war. Sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close: \
One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows. The hissing steel is in the \
smithy drown'd; The grot with beaten anvils groans around. By turns their \
arms advance, in equal time; By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime. \
They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs; The fiery work proceeds, with \
rustic songs. While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge Their labors \
thus, and ply th' Aeolian forge, The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes, \
And songs of chirping birds invite to rise. He leaves his lowly bed: his \
buskins meet Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet: He sets his trusty \
sword upon his side, And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide. Two \
menial dogs before their master press'd. Thus clad, and guarded thus, he \
seeks his kingly guest. Mindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace, But meets \
Aeneas in the middle space. Young Pallas did his father's steps attend, And \
true Achates waited on his friend. They join their hands; a secret seat they \
choose; Th' Arcadian first their former talk renews: \"Undaunted prince, I \
never can believe The Trojan empire lost, while you survive. Command th' \
assistance of a faithful friend; But feeble are the succors I can send. Our \
narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds; That other side the Latian state \
surrounds, Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds. But mighty \
nations I prepare, to join Their arms with yours, and aid your just design. \
You come, as by your better genius sent, And fortune seems to favor your \
intent. Not far from hence there stands a hilly town, Of ancient building, \
and of high renown, Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race, Who gave the \
name of Caere to the place, Once Agyllina call'd. It flourish'd long, In \
pride of wealth and warlike people strong, Till curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal \
hour, Assum'd the crown, with arbitrary pow'r. What words can paint those \
execrable times, The subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes! That \
blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace On his own head, and on his impious \
race! The living and the dead at his command Were coupled, face to face, and \
hand to hand, Till, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied, The \
ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died. Thus plung'd in ills, and meditating \
more- The people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore The raging monster; but \
with arms beset His house, and vengeance and destruction threat. They fire \
his palace: while the flame ascends, They force his guards, and execute his \
friends. He cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night, To Turnus' friendly \
court directs his flight. By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire, With arms, \
their king to punishment require: Their num'rous troops, now muster'd on the \
strand, My counsel shall submit to your command. Their navy swarms upon the \
coasts; they cry To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny. An ancient augur, \
skill'd in future fate, With these foreboding words restrains their hate: 'Ye \
brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all \
their pow'r, Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms, To seek your tyrant's \
death by lawful arms; Know this: no native of our land may lead This pow'rful \
people; seek a foreign head.' Aw'd with these words, in camps they still \
abide, And wait with longing looks their promis'd guide. Tarchon, the Tuscan \
chief, to me has sent Their crown, and ev'ry regal ornament: The people join \
their own with his desire; And all my conduct, as their king, require. But \
the chill blood that creeps within my veins, And age, and listless limbs \
unfit for pains, And a soul conscious of its own decay, Have forc'd me to \
refuse imperial sway. My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne, And \
should, but he's a Sabine mother's son, And half a native; but, in you, \
combine A manly vigor, and a foreign line. Where Fate and smiling Fortune \
shew the way, Pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway. The staff of my \
declining days, my son, Shall make your good or ill success his own; In \
fighting fields from you shall learn to dare, And serve the hard \
apprenticeship of war; Your matchless courage and your conduct view, And \
early shall begin t' admire and copy you. Besides, two hundred horse he shall \
command; Tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band. These in my name are \
listed; and my son As many more has added in his own.\" Scarce had he said; \
Achates and his guest, With downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd; Who, \
short of succors, and in deep despair, Shook at the dismal prospect of the \
war. But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud, To cheer her issue, \
thunder'd thrice aloud; Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky, And \
Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high. Then, gazing up, repeated peals \
they hear; And, in a heav'n serene, refulgent arms appear: Redd'ning the \
skies, and glitt'ring all around, The temper'd metals clash, and yield a \
silver sound. The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine; Aeneas only, \
conscious to the sign, Presag'd th' event, and joyful view'd, above, Th' \
accomplish'd promise of the Queen of Love. Then, to th' Arcadian king: \"This \
prodigy (Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me. Heav'n calls me to the war: \
th' expected sign Is giv'n of promis'd aid, and arms divine. My goddess \
mother, whose indulgent care Foresaw the dangers of the growing war, This \
omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms, Fated from force of steel by Stygian \
charms, Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd Approaching fights, and \
fields to float in blood. Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn; And \
corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne, Shall choke his flood: now \
sound the loud alarms; And, Latian troops, prepare your perjur'd arms.\" He \
said, and, rising from his homely throne, The solemn rites of Hercules begun, \
And on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires; Then cheerful to his household \
gods retires; There offers chosen sheep. Th' Arcadian king And Trojan youth \
the same oblations bring. Next, of his men and ships he makes review; Draws \
out the best and ablest of the crew. Down with the falling stream the refuse \
run, To raise with joyful news his drooping son. Steeds are prepar'd to mount \
the Trojan band, Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land. A sprightly \
courser, fairer than the rest, The king himself presents his royal guest: A \
lion's hide his back and limbs infold, Precious with studded work, and paws \
of gold. Fame thro' the little city spreads aloud Th' intended march, amid \
the fearful crowd: The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears, And \
double their devotion in their fears. The war at hand appears with more \
affright, And rises ev'ry moment to the sight. Then old Evander, with a close \
embrace, Strain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face. \"Would \
Heav'n,\" said he, \"my strength and youth recall, Such as I was beneath \
Praeneste's wall; Then when I made the foremost foes retire, And set whole \
heaps of conquer'd shields on fire; When Herilus in single fight I slew, Whom \
with three lives Feronia did endue; And thrice I sent him to the Stygian \
shore, Till the last ebbing soul return'd no more- Such if I stood renew'd, \
not these alarms, Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas' arms; Nor proud \
Mezentius, thus unpunish'd, boast His rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast. \
Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring Relief, and hear a father and a king! \
If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see My son return with peace and \
victory; If the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight; If we shall meet \
again with more delight; Then draw my life in length; let me sustain, In \
hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain. But if your hard decrees- which, O! \
I dread- Have doom'd to death his undeserving head; This, O this very moment, \
let me die! While hopes and fears in equal balance lie; While, yet possess'd \
of all his youthful charms, I strain him close within these aged arms; Before \
that fatal news my soul shall wound!\" He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the \
ground. His servants bore him off, and softly laid His languish'd limbs upon \
his homely bed. The horsemen march; the gates are open'd wide; Aeneas at \
their head, Achates by his side. Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along; \
Last follows in the rear th' Arcadian throng. Young Pallas shone conspicuous \
o'er the rest; Gilded his arms, embroider'd was his vest. So, from the seas, \
exerts his radiant head The star by whom the lights of heav'n are led; Shakes \
from his rosy locks the pearly dews, Dispels the darkness, and the day \
renews. The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd, And follow, with \
their eyes, the dusty cloud, Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far \
The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war. The troops, drawn up in \
beautiful array, O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way. Repeated peals of \
shouts are heard around; The neighing coursers answer to the sound, And shake \
with horny hoofs the solid ground. A greenwood shade, for long religion \
known, Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town, Incompass'd round \
with gloomy hills above, Which add a holy horror to the grove. The first \
inhabitants of Grecian blood, That sacred forest to Silvanus vow'd, The \
guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay Their due devotions on his \
annual day. Not far from hence, along the river's side, In tents secure, the \
Tuscan troops abide, By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground, Aeneas cast \
his wond'ring eyes around, And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight, Stretch'd \
on the spacious plain from left to right. Thether his warlike train the \
Trojan led, Refresh'd his men, and wearied horses fed. Meantime the mother \
goddess, crown'd with charms, Breaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated \
arms. Within a winding vale she finds her son, On the cool river's banks, \
retir'd alone. She shews her heav'nly form without disguise, And gives \
herself to his desiring eyes. \"Behold,\" she said, \"perform'd in ev'ry \
part, My promise made, and Vulcan's labor'd art. Now seek, secure, the Latian \
enemy, And haughty Turnus to the field defy.\" She said; and, having first \
her son embrac'd, The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd, Proud of the \
gift, he roll'd his greedy sight Around the work, and gaz'd with vast \
delight. He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires The crested helm, that \
vomits radiant fires: His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold, One keen \
with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold: Both ample, flaming both, and beamy \
bright; So shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse light. He shakes the \
pointed spear, and longs to try The plated cuishes on his manly thigh; But \
most admires the shield's mysterious mold, And Roman triumphs rising on the \
gold: For these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought (Not in the rolls \
of future fate untaught) The wars in order, and the race divine Of warriors \
issuing from the Julian line. The cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens: \
There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins. Intrepid on her swelling \
dugs they hung; The foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue: They suck'd \
secure, while, bending back her head, She lick'd their tender limbs, and \
form'd them as they fed. Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games \
Projected for the rape of Sabine dames. The pit resounds with shrieks; a war \
succeeds, For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds. Here for revenge \
the Sabine troops contend; The Romans there with arms the prey defend. \
Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease; And both the kings and \
kingdoms plight the peace. The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand, \
Both arm'd, with each a charger in his hand: A fatted sow for sacrifice is \
led, With imprecations on the perjur'd head. Near this, the traitor Metius, \
stretch'd between Four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green, By Tullus' \
doom: the brambles drink his blood, And his torn limbs are left the vulture's \
food. There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings, And would by force restore \
the banish'd kings. One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights; The Roman youth \
assert their native rights. Before the town the Tuscan army lies, To win by \
famine, or by fraud surprise. Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining \
stood, While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood. The captive \
maids there tempt the raging tide, Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for \
their guide. High on a rock heroic Manlius stood, To guard the temple, and \
the temple's god. Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold The palace \
thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with gold. The silver goose before the \
shining gate There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state. She told the \
Gauls' approach; th' approaching Gauls, Obscure in night, ascend, and seize \
the walls. The gold dissembled well their yellow hair, And golden chains on \
their white necks they wear. Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they \
wield, And their left arm sustains a length of shield. Hard by, the leaping \
Salian priests advance; And naked thro' the streets the mad Luperci dance, In \
caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n. Here modest matrons, in soft \
litters driv'n, To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear, And odorous gums in \
their chaste hands they bear. Far hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen; \
Pains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline Hung on a rock- the traitor; and, \
around, The Furies hissing from the nether ground. Apart from these, the \
happy souls he draws, And Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws. Betwixt the \
quarters flows a golden sea; But foaming surges there in silver play. The \
dancing dolphins with their tails divide The glitt'ring waves, and cut the \
precious tide. Amid the main, two mighty fleets engage Their brazen beaks, \
oppos'd with equal rage. Actium surveys the well-disputed prize; Leucate's \
wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries. Young Caesar, on the stern, in armor \
bright, Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight: His beamy temples \
shoot their flames afar, And o'er his head is hung the Julian star. Agrippa \
seconds him, with prosp'rous gales, And, with propitious gods, his foes \
assails: A naval crown, that binds his manly brows, The happy fortune of the \
fight foreshows. Rang'd on the line oppos'd, Antonius brings Barbarian aids, \
and troops of Eastern kings; Th' Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar, Of \
tongues discordant, and a mingled war: And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the \
strife, His ill fate follows him- th' Egyptian wife. Moving they fight; with \
oars and forky prows The froth is gather'd, and the water glows. It seems, as \
if the Cyclades again Were rooted up, and justled in the main; Or floating \
mountains floating mountains meet; Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet. \
Fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav'lins fly; The fields of Neptune take a \
purple dye. The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms, With cymbals toss'd \
her fainting soldiers warms- Fool as she was! who had not yet divin'd Her \
cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind. Her country gods, the monsters of the \
sky, Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love's Queen defy: The dog Anubis barks, but \
barks in vain, Nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train. Mars in the middle \
of the shining shield Is grav'd, and strides along the liquid field. The \
Dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent; And Discord, dyed in blood, with \
garments rent, Divides the prease: her steps Bellona treads, And shakes her \
iron rod above their heads. This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height, Pours \
down his arrows; at whose winged flight The trembling Indians and Egyptians \
yield, And soft Sabaeans quit the wat'ry field. The fatal mistress hoists her \
silken sails, And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales. Aghast she \
looks, and heaves her breast for breath, Panting, and pale with fear of \
future death. The god had figur'd her as driv'n along By winds and waves, and \
scudding thro' the throng. Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide His arms and \
ample bosom to the tide, And spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast, In \
which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host. The victor to the gods \
his thanks express'd, And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless'd. Three \
hundred temples in the town he plac'd; With spoils and altars ev'ry temple \
grac'd. Three shining nights, and three succeeding days, The fields resound \
with shouts, the streets with praise, The domes with songs, the theaters with \
plays. All altars flame: before each altar lies, Drench'd in his gore, the \
destin'd sacrifice. Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne, Before \
Apollo's porch of Parian stone; Accepts the presents vow'd for victory, And \
hangs the monumental crowns on high. Vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march \
along, Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue. Here, Mulciber assigns the \
proper place For Carians, and th' ungirt Numidian race; Then ranks the \
Thracians in the second row, With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow. And \
here the tam'd Euphrates humbly glides, And there the Rhine submits her \
swelling tides, And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; The Danes' \
unconquer'd offspring march behind, And Morini, the last of humankind. These \
figures, on the shield divinely wrought, By Vulcan labor'd, and by Venus \
brought, With joy and wonder fill the hero's thought. Unknown the names, he \
yet admires the grace, And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race. BOOK \
IX While these affairs in distant places pass'd, The various Iris Juno sends \
with haste, To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, The secret shade \
of his great grandsire sought. Retir'd alone she found the daring man, And \
op'd her rosy lips, and thus began: \"What none of all the gods could grant \
thy vows, That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. Aeneas, gone to seek th' \
Arcadian prince, Has left the Trojan camp without defense; And, short of \
succors there, employs his pains In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. \
Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs; Unite thy forces, and attack \
their lines.\" This said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight, And form'd a \
radiant rainbow in her flight. The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes, And \
thus invokes the goddess as she flies: \"Iris, the grace of heav'n, what \
pow'r divine Has sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine? See, they \
divide; immortal day appears, And glitt'ring planets dancing in their \
spheres! With joy, these happy omens I obey, And follow to the war the god \
that leads the way.\" Thus having said, as by the brook he stood, He scoop'd \
the water from the crystal flood; Then with his hands the drops to heav'n he \
throws, And loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows. Now march the bold \
confed'rates thro' the plain, Well hors'd, well clad; a rich and shining \
train. Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear, The sons of Tyrrheus in \
bright arms appear. In the main battle, with his flaming crest, The mighty \
Turnus tow'rs above the rest. Silent they move, majestically slow, Like \
ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow. The Trojans view the dusty cloud from \
far, And the dark menace of the distant war. Caicus from the rampire saw it \
rise, Black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies. Then to his \
fellows thus aloud he calls: \"What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the \
walls? Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears And pointed darts! \
the Latian host appears.\" Thus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts \
ascend The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend: For their wise gen'ral, \
with foreseeing care, Had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war, Nor, \
tho' provok'd, in open fields advance, But close within their lines attend \
their chance. Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command, And sourly wait in \
arms the hostile band. The fiery Turnus flew before the rest: A piebald steed \
of Thracian strain he press'd; His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his \
crest. With twenty horse to second his designs, An unexpected foe, he fac'd \
the lines. \"Is there,\" he said, \"in arms, who bravely dare His leader's \
honor and his danger share?\" Then spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw, \
In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue. Amaz'd to find a dastard race, that \
run Behind the rampires and the battle shun, He rides around the camp, with \
rolling eyes, And stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries. So roams the \
nightly wolf about the fold: Wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with \
cold, He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain, (His gnashing teeth are \
exercis'd in vain,) And, impotent of anger, finds no way In his distended \
paws to grasp the prey. The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs Securely \
swig the dug, beneath the dams. Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain. \
Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain; Surveys each passage with a \
piercing sight, To force his foes in equal field to fight. Thus while he \
gazes round, at length he spies, Where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their \
navy lies, Close underneath the walls; the washing tide Secures from all \
approach this weaker side. He takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand With \
ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand. Urg'd by his presence, ev'ry soul is \
warm'd, And ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd. From the fir'd pines the \
scatt'ring sparkles fly; Fat vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the sky. What \
pow'r, O Muses, could avert the flame Which threaten'd, in the fleet, the \
Trojan name? Tell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure, Is hard to \
faith; yet shall the fame endure. 'T is said that, when the chief prepar'd \
his flight, And fell'd his timber from Mount Ida's height, The grandam \
goddess then approach'd her son, And with a mother's majesty begun: \"Grant \
me,\" she said, \"the sole request I bring, Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd \
you for its king. On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood, With firs and \
maples fill'd, a shady wood; And on the summit rose a sacred grove, Where I \
was worship'd with religious love. Those woods, that holy grove, my long \
delight, I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight. Now, fill'd with \
fear, on their behalf I come; Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb The \
floating forests of the sacred pine; But let it be their safety to be mine.\" \
Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls The radiant stars, and heav'n and \
earth controls: \"How dare you, mother, endless date demand For vessels \
molded by a mortal hand? What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride, Of safety \
certain, on th' uncertain tide? Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o'er, \
The chief is landed on the Latian shore, Whatever ships escape the raging \
storms, At my command shall change their fading forms To nymphs divine, and \
plow the wat'ry way, Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea.\" To seal his \
sacred vow, by Styx he swore, The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore, And \
Phlegethon's innavigable flood, And the black regions of his brother god. He \
said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod. And now at length the \
number'd hours were come, Prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom, When the great \
Mother of the Gods was free To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree. \
First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung A light that sign'd the \
heav'ns, and shot along; Then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires, \
Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs; And, last, a voice, with more \
than mortal sounds, Both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal horror wounds: \
\"O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear, And know, my ships are my \
peculiar care. With greater ease the bold Rutulian may, With hissing brands, \
attempt to burn the sea, Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge, \
Loos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large, Exalted each a nymph: \
forsake the sand, And swim the seas, at Cybele's command.\" No sooner had the \
goddess ceas'd to speak, When, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break; \
And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main They plunge their prows, and \
dive, and spring again: As many beauteous maids the billows sweep, As rode \
before tall vessels on the deep. The foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood \
aghast; Messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste; Old Tiber roar'd, and, \
raising up his head, Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed. Turnus alone, \
undaunted, bore the shock, And with these words his trembling troops bespoke: \
\"These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant, And are by Jove for black \
presages sent. He takes the cowards' last relief away; For fly they cannot, \
and, constrain'd to stay, Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey. The \
liquid half of all the globe is lost; Heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure \
the coast. Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground Which myriads of \
our martial men surround. Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles. 'T was \
giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas, And land secure upon the Latian \
plains: Their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains. 'T is in the fate of \
Turnus to destroy, With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy. Shall \
such affronts as these alone inflame The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian \
name? My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife, And final ruin, for a \
ravish'd wife. Was 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime, They fell; \
but will they fall a second time? One would have thought they paid enough \
before, To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more. Can they securely \
trust their feeble wall, A slight partition, a thin interval, Betwixt their \
fate and them; when Troy, tho' built By hands divine, yet perish'd by their \
guilt? Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands, To force from out \
their lines these dastard bands. Less than a thousand ships will end this \
war, Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare. Let all the Tuscans, all th' \
Arcadians, join! Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design. Let them \
not fear the treasons of the night, The robb'd Palladium, the pretended \
flight: Our onset shall be made in open light. No wooden engine shall their \
town betray; Fires they shall have around, but fires by day. No Grecian babes \
before their camp appear, Whom Hector's arms detain'd to the tenth tardy \
year. Now, since the sun is rolling to the west, Give we the silent night to \
needful rest: Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare; The morn shall end \
the small remains of war.\" The post of honor to Messapus falls, To keep the \
nightly guard, to watch the walls, To pitch the fires at distances around, \
And close the Trojans in their scanty ground. Twice seven Rutulian captains \
ready stand, And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command; All clad in \
shining arms the works invest, Each with a radiant helm and waving crest. \
Stretch'd at their length, they press the grassy ground; They laugh, they \
sing, (the jolly bowls go round,) With lights and cheerful fires renew the \
day, And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play. The Trojans, from above, \
their foes beheld, And with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd. Seiz'd \
with affright, their gates they first explore; Join works to works with \
bridges, tow'r to tow'r: Thus all things needful for defense abound. \
Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round, Commission'd by their absent \
prince to share The common danger, and divide the care. The soldiers draw \
their lots, and, as they fall, By turns relieve each other on the wall. Nigh \
where the foes their utmost guards advance, To watch the gate was warlike \
Nisus' chance. His father Hyrtacus of noble blood; His mother was a huntress \
of the wood, And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear His lance in fight, \
and dart the flying spear, But better skill'd unerring shafts to send. Beside \
him stood Euryalus, his friend: Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host No fairer \
face, or sweeter air, could boast- Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks \
begun. One was their care, and their delight was one: One common hazard in \
the war they shar'd, And now were both by choice upon the guard. Then Nisus \
thus: \"Or do the gods inspire This warmth, or make we gods of our desire? A \
gen'rous ardor boils within my breast, Eager of action, enemy to rest: This \
urges me to fight, and fires my mind To leave a memorable name behind. Thou \
see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine Their scatter'd fires! the most, in \
sleep supine Along the ground, an easy conquest lie: The wakeful few the \
fuming flagon ply; All hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve- A thought \
unripe- and scarcely yet resolve. Our absent prince both camp and council \
mourn; By message both would hasten his return: If they confer what I demand \
on thee, (For fame is recompense enough for me,) Methinks, beneath yon hill, \
I have espied A way that safely will my passage guide.\" Euryalus stood \
list'ning while he spoke, With love of praise and noble envy struck; Then to \
his ardent friend expos'd his mind: \"All this, alone, and leaving me behind! \
Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join'd? Thinkist thou I can my share of glory \
yield, Or send thee unassisted to the field? Not so my father taught my \
childhood arms; Born in a siege, and bred among alarms! Nor is my youth \
unworthy of my friend, Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend. The thing call'd \
life, with ease I can disclaim, And think it over-sold to purchase fame.\" \
Then Nisus thus: \"Alas! thy tender years Would minister new matter to my \
fears. So may the gods, who view this friendly strife, Restore me to thy \
lov'd embrace with life, Condemn'd to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,) This \
thy request is cruel and unjust. But if some chance- as many chances are, And \
doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war- If one should reach my head, there let \
it fall, And spare thy life; I would not perish all. Thy bloomy youth \
deserves a longer date: Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate; To bear \
my mangled body from the foe, Or buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow. Or, \
if hard fortune shall those dues deny, Thou canst at least an empty tomb \
supply. O let not me the widow's tears renew! Nor let a mother's curse my \
name pursue: Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee, Forsook the coasts of \
friendly Sicily, Her age committing to the seas and wind, When ev'ry weary \
matron stay'd behind.\" To this, Euryalus: \"You plead in vain, And but \
protract the cause you cannot gain. No more delays, but haste!\" With that, \
he wakes The nodding watch; each to his office takes. The guard reliev'd, the \
gen'rous couple went To find the council at the royal tent. All creatures \
else forgot their daily care, And sleep, the common gift of nature, share; \
Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate In nightly council for th' \
indanger'd state. They vote a message to their absent chief, Shew their \
distress, and beg a swift relief. Amid the camp a silent seat they chose, \
Remote from clamor, and secure from foes. On their left arms their ample \
shields they bear, The right reclin'd upon the bending spear. Now Nisus and \
his friend approach the guard, And beg admission, eager to be heard: Th' \
affair important, not to be deferr'd. Ascanius bids 'em be conducted in, \
Ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin. Then Nisus thus: \"Ye fathers, lend \
your ears; Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years. The foe, securely \
drench'd in sleep and wine, Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine; \
And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies, Cov'ring the plain, and curling \
to the skies, Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, Close by the sea, \
a passage we have spied, Which will our way to great Aeneas guide. Expect \
each hour to see him safe again, Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain. \
Snatch we the lucky minute while we may; Nor can we be mistaken in the way; \
For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen The rising turrets, and the \
stream between, And know the winding course, with ev'ry ford.\" He ceas'd; \
and old Alethes took the word: \"Our country gods, in whom our trust we \
place, Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race, While we behold such \
dauntless worth appear In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear.\" Then \
into tears of joy the father broke; Each in his longing arms by turns he \
took; Panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke: \"Ye brave young men, what \
equal gifts can we, In recompense of such desert, decree? The greatest, sure, \
and best you can receive, The gods and your own conscious worth will give. \
The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow, And young Ascanius till his \
manhood owe.\" \"And I, whose welfare in my father lies,\" Ascanius adds, \
\"by the great deities, By my dear country, by my household gods, By hoary \
Vesta's rites and dark abodes, Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands; \
That and my faith I plight into your hands,) Make me but happy in his safe \
return, Whose wanted presence I can only mourn; Your common gift shall two \
large goblets be Of silver, wrought with curious imagery, And high emboss'd, \
which, when old Priam reign'd, My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd; \
And more, two tripods cast in antic mold, With two great talents of the \
finest gold; Beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art, Which Dido gave, when \
first she gave her heart. But, if in conquer'd Italy we reign, When spoils by \
lot the victor shall obtain- Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd: \
That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest, And shield, from chance exempt, \
shall be thy share: Twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair \
All clad in rich attire, and train'd with care; And, last, a Latian field \
with fruitful plains, And a large portion of the king's domains. But thou, \
whose years are more to mine allied- No fate my vow'd affection shall divide \
From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine; Take full possession; all my soul is \
thine. One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend; My life's companion, \
and my bosom friend: My peace shall be committed to thy care, And to thy \
conduct my concerns in war.\" Then thus the young Euryalus replied: \
\"Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide, The same shall be my age, as now my \
youth; No time shall find me wanting to my truth. This only from your \
goodness let me gain (And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain) Of Priam's \
royal race my mother came- And sure the best that ever bore the name- Whom \
neither Troy nor Sicily could hold From me departing, but, o'erspent and old, \
My fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this (Whatever) danger, neither parting \
kiss, Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave, And in this only act of all my \
life deceive. By this right hand and conscious Night I swear, My soul so sad \
a farewell could not bear. Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place (Permit \
me to presume so great a grace) Support her age, forsaken and distress'd. \
That hope alone will fortify my breast Against the worst of fortunes, and of \
fears.\" He said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears. Then thus Ascanius, \
wonderstruck to see That image of his filial piety: \"So great beginnings, in \
so green an age, Exact the faith which I again ingage. Thy mother all the \
dues shall justly claim, Creusa had, and only want the name. Whate'er event \
thy bold attempt shall have, 'T is merit to have borne a son so brave. Now by \
my head, a sacred oath, I swear, (My father us'd it,) what, returning here \
Crown'd with success, I for thyself prepare, That, if thou fail, shall thy \
lov'd mother share.\" He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word, From his \
broad belt he drew a shining sword, Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made, And \
in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade. This was his gift. Great Mnestheus \
gave his friend A lion's hide, his body to defend; And good Alethes furnish'd \
him, beside, With his own trusty helm, of temper tried. Thus arm'd they went. \
The noble Trojans wait Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate With \
prayers and vows. Above the rest appears Ascanius, manly far beyond his \
years, And messages committed to their care, Which all in winds were lost, \
and flitting air. The trenches first they pass'd; then took their way Where \
their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay; To many fatal, ere themselves were \
slain. They found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain, Who, gorg'd, \
and drunk with wine, supinely snore. Unharness'd chariots stand along the \
shore: Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by, A medley of debauch and \
war, they lie. Observing Nisus shew'd his friend the sight: \"Behold a \
conquest gain'd without a fight. Occasion offers, and I stand prepar'd; There \
lies our way; be thou upon the guard, And look around, while I securely go, \
And hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe.\" Softly he spoke; then striding \
took his way, With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay; His head \
rais'd high on tapestry beneath, And heaving from his breast, he drew his \
breath; A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov'd: But fate by prescience \
cannot be remov'd. Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies Where \
Remus, with his rich retinue, lies. His armor-bearer first, and next he kills \
His charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels And his lov'd horses; last \
invades their lord; Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword: The gasping \
head flies off; a purple flood Flows from the trunk, that welters in the \
blood, Which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around, The bed besprinkles and \
bedews the ground. Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong, He slew, and then \
Serranus fair and young. From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest, And \
puff'd the fumy god from out his breast: Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and \
lucky play- More lucky, had it lasted till the day. The famish'd lion thus, \
with hunger bold, O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold, And tears the \
peaceful flocks: with silent awe Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his \
paw. Nor with less rage Euryalus employs The wrathful sword, or fewer foes \
destroys; But on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew; He Fadus, Hebesus, and \
Rhoetus slew. Oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell, But Rhoetus \
wakeful, and observing all: Behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear; The \
fatal iron found and reach'd him there; For, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked \
side, And, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed. The wound pours out a \
stream of wine and blood; The purple soul comes floating in the flood. Now, \
where Messapus quarter'd, they arrive. The fires were fainting there, and \
just alive; The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed. Nisus observ'd the \
discipline, and said: \"Our eager thirst of blood may both betray; And see \
the scatter'd streaks of dawning day, Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my \
friend; Here let our glutted execution end. A lane thro' slaughter'd bodies \
we have made.\" The bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd. Of arms, and arras, and \
of plate, they find A precious load; but these they leave behind. Yet, fond \
of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay To make the rich caparison his prey, \
Which on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay. Nor did his eyes less longingly \
behold The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold. This present Caedicus \
the rich bestow'd On Remulus, when friendship first they vow'd, And, absent, \
join'd in hospitable ties: He, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize; Till, \
by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd, He fell; and they the glorious \
gift possess'd. These glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain) He to \
his body suits, but suits in vain: Messapus' helm he finds among the rest, \
And laces on, and wears the waving crest. Proud of their conquest, prouder of \
their prey, They leave the camp, and take the ready way. But far they had not \
pass'd, before they spied Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide. \
The queen a legion to King Turnus sent; But the swift horse the slower foot \
prevent, And now, advancing, sought the leader's tent. They saw the pair; \
for, thro' the doubtful shade, His shining helm Euryalus betray'd, On which \
the moon with full reflection play'd. \"'T is not for naught,\" cried \
Volscens from the crowd, \"These men go there;\" then rais'd his voice aloud: \
\"Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent? From whence, to whom, and \
on what errand sent?\" Silent they scud away, and haste their flight To \
neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night. The speedy horse all \
passages belay, And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way, And watch \
each entrance of the winding wood. Black was the forest: thick with beech it \
stood, Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn; Few paths of human feet, \
or tracks of beasts, were worn. The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey, \
And fear, misled the younger from his way. But Nisus hit the turns with \
happier haste, And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd, And Alban \
plains, from Alba's name so call'd, Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd; \
Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground, And miss'd his friend, and \
cast his eyes around: \"Ah wretch!\" he cried, \"where have I left behind Th' \
unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find? Or what way take?\" Again he \
ventures back, And treads the mazes of his former track. He winds the wood, \
and, list'ning, hears the noise Of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice. \
The sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd The foes inclosing, and his \
friend pursued, Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain The shelter of \
the friendly shades to gain. What should he next attempt? what arms employ, \
What fruitless force, to free the captive boy? Or desperate should he rush \
and lose his life, With odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife? Resolv'd at \
length, his pointed spear he shook; And, casting on the moon a mournful look: \
\"Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night, Fair queen,\" he said, \
\"direct my dart aright. If e'er my pious father, for my sake, Did grateful \
off'rings on thy altars make, Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils, And \
hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils, Give me to scatter these.\" Then from \
his ear He pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear. The deadly \
weapon, hissing from the grove, Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove; Pierc'd \
his thin armor, drank his vital blood, And in his body left the broken He \
staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death, And with short sobs he gasps away \
his breath. All stand amaz'd- a second jav'lin flies With equal strength, and \
quivers thro' the skies. This thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way, And \
in the brainpan warmly buried lay. Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, \
gazing round, Descried not him who gave the fatal wound, Nor knew to fix \
revenge: \"But thou,\" he cries, \"Shalt pay for both,\" and at the pris'ner \
flies With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair, That cruel sight \
the lover could not bear; But from his covert rush'd in open view, And sent \
his voice before him as he flew: \"Me! me!\" he cried- \"turn all your swords \
alone On me- the fact confess'd, the fault my own. He neither could nor \
durst, the guiltless youth: Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth! His \
only crime (if friendship can offend) Is too much love to his unhappy friend.\
\" Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides, Driv'n with full force, \
had pierc'd his tender sides. Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning \
wound Gush'd out a purple stream, and stain'd the ground. His snowy neck \
reclines upon his breast, Like a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd; \
Like a white poppy sinking on the plain, Whose heavy head is overcharg'd with \
rain. Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd, Drove Nisus headlong on \
the hostile crowd. Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends: Borne back and \
bor'd by his surrounding friends, Onward he press'd, and kept him still in \
sight; Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might: Th' unerring steel \
descended while he spoke, Piered his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke. \
Dying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain, With swimming eyes he sought \
his lover slain; Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell, Content, in death, to \
be reveng'd so well. O happy friends! for, if my verse can give Immortal \
life, your fame shall ever live, Fix'd as the Capitol's foundation lies, And \
spread, where'er the Roman eagle flies! The conqu'ring party first divide the \
prey, Then their slain leader to the camp convey. With wonder, as they went, \
the troops were fill'd, To see such numbers whom so few had kill'd. Serranus, \
Rhamnes, and the rest, they found: Vast crowds the dying and the dead \
surround; And the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground. All knew the helmet \
which Messapus lost, But mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost. Now rose \
the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed, And with the dawn of day the skies \
o'erspread; Nor long the sun his daily course withheld, But added colors to \
the world reveal'd: When early Turnus, wak'ning with the light, All clad in \
armor, calls his troops to fight. His martial men with fierce harangue he \
fir'd, And his own ardor in their souls inspir'd. This done- to give new \
terror to his foes, The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows, Rais'd high \
on pointed spears- a ghastly sight: Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous \
delight. Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls; They line their \
trenches, and they man their walls. In front extended to the left they stood; \
Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood. But, casting from their tow'rs a \
frightful view, They saw the faces, which too well they knew, Tho' then \
disguis'd in death, and smear'd all o'er With filth obscene, and dropping \
putrid gore. Soon hasty fame thro' the sad city bears The mournful message to \
the mother's ears. An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes; Her cheeks the \
blood, her hand the web forsakes. She runs the rampires round amidst the war, \
Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair, And fills with loud laments \
the liquid air. \"Thus, then, my lov'd Euryalus appears! Thus looks the prop \
my declining years! Was't on this face my famish'd eyes I fed? Ah! how unlike \
the living is the dead! And could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone? Not \
one kind kiss from a departing son! No look, no last adieu before he went, In \
an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent! Cold on the ground, and pressing \
foreign clay, To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey! Nor was I near to \
close his dying eyes, To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies, To call \
about his corpse his crying friends, Or spread the mantle (made for other \
ends) On his dear body, which I wove with care, Nor did my daily pains or \
nightly labor spare. Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains His \
trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains? For this, alas! I left my needful \
ease, Expos'd my life to winds and winter seas! If any pity touch Rutulian \
hearts, Here empty all your quivers, all your darts; Or, if they fail, thou, \
Jove, conclude my woe, And send me thunderstruck to shades below!\" Her \
shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans' ears, Unman their courage, and \
augment their fears; Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain, Nor old \
Ilioneus his tears restrain, But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent, To bear the \
madding mother to her tent. And now the trumpets terribly, from far, With \
rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy war. The soldiers' shouts succeed the \
brazen sounds; And heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds. The \
Volscians bear their shields upon their head, And, rushing forward, form a \
moving shed. These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down: Some raise \
the ladders; others scale the town. But, where void spaces on the walls \
appear, Or thin defense, they pour their forces there. With poles and missive \
weapons, from afar, The Trojans keep aloof the rising war. Taught, by their \
ten years' siege, defensive fight, They roll down ribs of rocks, an \
unresisted weight, To break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow, Which yet \
the patient Volscians undergo: But could not bear th' unequal combat long; \
For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng, The ruin falls: their \
shatter'd shields give way, And their crush'd heads become an easy prey. They \
shrink for fear, abated of their rage, Nor longer dare in a blind fight \
engage; Contented now to gall them from below With darts and slings, and with \
the distant bow. Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view, A blazing pine within \
the trenches threw. But brave Messapus, Neptune's warlike son, Broke down the \
palisades, the trenches won, And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town. \
Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine, Inspire your poet in his high design, To \
sing what slaughter manly Turnus made, What souls he sent below the Stygian \
shade, What fame the soldiers with their captain share, And the vast circuit \
of the fatal war; For you in singing martial facts excel; You best remember, \
and alone can tell. There stood a tow'r, amazing to the sight, Built up of \
beams, and of stupendous height: Art, and the nature of the place, conspir'd \
To furnish all the strength that war requir'd. To level this, the bold \
Italians join; The wary Trojans obviate their design; With weighty stones \
o'erwhelm their troops below, Shoot thro' the loopholes, and sharp jav'lins \
throw. Turnus, the chief, toss'd from his thund'ring hand Against the wooden \
walls, a flaming brand: It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high; The \
planks were season'd, and the timber dry. Contagion caught the posts; it \
spread along, Scorch'd, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng. The \
Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain, Still gath'ring fast upon the trembling \
train; Till, crowding to the corners of the wall, Down the defense and the \
defenders fall. The mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound: The dead and \
dying Trojans strew the ground. The tow'r, that follow'd on the fallen crew, \
Whelm'd o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew: Some stuck upon the darts \
themselves had sent; All the same equal ruin underwent. Young Lycus and \
Helenor only scape; Sav'd- how, they know not- from the steepy leap. Helenor, \
elder of the two: by birth, On one side royal, one a son of earth, Whom to \
the Lydian king Licymnia bare, And sent her boasted bastard to the war (A \
privilege which none but freemen share). Slight were his arms, a sword and \
silver shield: No marks of honor charg'd its empty field. Light as he fell, \
so light the youth arose, And rising, found himself amidst his foes; Nor \
flight was left, nor hopes to force his way. Embolden'd by despair, he stood \
at bay; And- like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds Of eager huntsmen and \
invading hounds- Resolv'd on death, he dissipates his fears, And bounds aloft \
against the pointed spears: So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws \
His dying body on his thickest foes. But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far, \
Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war; Springs to the walls, and \
leaves his foes behind, And snatches at the beam he first can find; Looks up, \
and leaps aloft at all the stretch, In hopes the helping hand of some kind \
friend to reach. But Turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey (His spear had \
almost reach'd him in the way, Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind) \
\"Fool!\" said the chief, \"tho' fleeter than the wind, Couldst thou presume \
to scape, when I pursue?\" He said, and downward by the feet he drew The \
trembling dastard; at the tug he falls; Vast ruins come along, rent from the \
smoking walls. Thus on some silver swan, or tim'rous hare, Jove's bird comes \
sousing down from upper air; Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey: Then \
out of sight she soars, and wings her way. So seizes the grim wolf the tender \
lamb, In vain lamented by the bleating dam. Then rushing onward with a \
barb'rous cry, The troops of Turnus to the combat fly. The ditch with fagots \
fill'd, the daring foe Toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw. \
Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came To force the gate, and feed the kindling \
flame, Roll'd down the fragment of a rock so right, It crush'd him double \
underneath the weight. Two more young Liger and Asylas slew: To bend the bow \
young Liger better knew; Asylas best the pointed jav'lin threw. Brave Caeneus \
laid Ortygius on the plain; The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain. By the \
same hand, Clonius and Itys fall, Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall. From \
Capys' arms his fate Privernus found: Hurt by Themilla first-but slight the \
wound- His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart, He clapp'd his hand upon \
the wounded part: The second shaft came swift and unespied, And pierc'd his \
hand, and nail'd it to his side, Transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating \
heart: The soul came issuing out, and hiss'd against the dart. The son of \
Arcens shone amid the rest, In glitt'ring armor and a purple vest, (Fair was \
his face, his eyes inspiring love,) Bred by his father in the Martian grove, \
Where the fat altars of Palicus flame, And send in arms to purchase early \
fame. Him when he spied from far, the Tuscan king Laid by the lance, and took \
him to the sling, Thrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw: The \
heated lead half melted as it flew; It pierc'd his hollow temples and his \
brain; The youth came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain. Then young \
Ascanius, who, before this day, Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey, \
First bent in martial strife the twanging bow, And exercis'd against a human \
foe- With this bereft Numanus of his life, Who Turnus' younger sister took to \
wife. Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride, Vaunting before his troops, \
and lengthen'd with a stride, In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied: \
\"Twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown- Coop'd up a second time \
within your town! Who dare not issue forth in open field, But hold your walls \
before you for a shield. Thus threat you war? thus our alliance force? What \
gods, what madness, hether steer'd your course? You shall not find the sons \
of Atreus here, Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear. Strong from the \
cradle, of a sturdy brood, We bear our newborn infants to the flood; There \
bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold, With winter harden'd, and inur'd to \
cold. They wake before the day to range the wood, Kill ere they eat, nor \
taste unconquer'd food. No sports, but what belong to war, they know: To \
break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow. Our youth, of labor patient, earn \
their bread; Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed. From plows and harrows \
sent to seek renown, They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town. No part \
of life from toils of war is free, No change in age, or diff'rence in degree. \
We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel, Instead of goads, the spur and \
pointed steel; Th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain. Ev'n time, that \
changes all, yet changes us in vain: The body, not the mind; nor can control \
Th' immortal vigor, or abate the soul. Our helms defend the young, disguise \
the gray: We live by plunder, and delight in prey. Your vests embroider'd \
with rich purple shine; In sloth you glory, and in dances join. Your vests \
have sweeping sleeves; with female pride Your turbants underneath your chins \
are tied. Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again! Go, less than women, in the \
shapes of men! Go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the Mother's rites, Where with \
unequal sound the flute invites; Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida's \
shade: Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!\" This foul \
reproach Ascanius could not hear With patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear. \
At the full stretch of both his hands he drew, And almost join'd the horns of \
the tough yew. But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood, And thus with \
lifted hands invok'd the god: \"My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed! An \
annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed; A snow-white steer, before thy \
altar led, Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head, Butts with his \
threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands, And dares the fight, and spurns the \
yellow sands.\" Jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear, And \
thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear. Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly \
flies The feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies. The steel thro' both \
his temples forc'd the way: Extended on the ground, Numanus lay. \"Go now, \
vain boaster, and true valor scorn! The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make \
this third return.\" Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake The heav'ns \
with shouting, and new vigor take. Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud, To \
view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; And thus the beardless victor he \
bespoke aloud: \"Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame, And wide from \
east to west extend thy name; Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe \
To thee a race of demigods below. This is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs \
divine From this beginning date the Julian line. To thee, to them, and their \
victorious heirs, The conquer'd war is due, and the vast world is theirs. \
Troy is too narrow for thy name.\" He said, And plunging downward shot his \
radiant head; Dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight: Shorn of \
his beams, a man to mortal sight. Old Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire, \
Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: His wrinkled visage, and his hoary \
hairs, His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, And thus salutes the boy, \
too forward for his years: \"Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son, The \
warlike prize thou hast already won. The god of archers gives thy youth a \
part Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. Now tempt the war no more.\" He \
said, and flew Obscure in air, and vanish'd from their view. The Trojans, by \
his arms, their patron know, And hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow. Then \
duteous force they use, and Phoebus' name, To keep from fight the youth too \
fond of fame. Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun; From wall to wall \
the shouts and clamors run. They bend their bows; they whirl their slings \
around; Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground; And helms, and \
shields, and rattling arms resound. The combat thickens, like the storm that \
flies From westward, when the show'ry Kids arise; Or patt'ring hail comes \
pouring on the main, When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain, Or bellowing \
clouds burst with a stormy sound, And with an armed winter strew the ground. \
Pand'rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war, Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare On \
Ida's top, two youths of height and size Like firs that on their mother \
mountain rise, Presuming on their force, the gates unbar, And of their own \
accord invite the war. With fates averse, against their king's command, \
Arm'd, on the right and on the left they stand, And flank the passage: \
shining steel they wear, And waving crests above their heads appear. Thus two \
tall oaks, that Padus' banks adorn, Lift up to heav'n their leafy heads \
unshorn, And, overpress'd with nature's heavy load, Dance to the whistling \
winds, and at each other nod. In flows a tide of Latians, when they see The \
gate set open, and the passage free; Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing \
on, Equicolus, that in bright armor shone, And Haemon first; but soon \
repuls'd they fly, Or in the well-defended pass they die. These with success \
are fir'd, and those with rage, And each on equal terms at length ingage. \
Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain, The Trojans hand to hand \
the fight maintain. Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought, When suddenly \
th' unhop'd-for news was brought, The foes had left the fastness of their \
place, Prevail'd in fight, and had his men in chase. He quits th' attack, \
and, to prevent their fate, Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate. The \
first he met, Antiphates the brave, But base-begotten on a Theban slave, \
Sarpedon's son, he slew: the deadly dart Found passage thro' his breast, and \
pierc'd his heart. Fix'd in the wound th' Italian cornel stood, Warm'd in his \
lungs, and in his vital blood. Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies, And \
Meropes, and the gigantic size Of Bitias, threat'ning with his ardent eyes. \
Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd (A dart were lost within that roomy \
breast), But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong, Which roar'd like \
thunder as it whirl'd along: Not two bull hides th' impetuous force withhold, \
Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold. Down sunk the monster bulk and \
press'd the ground; His arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast body sound, \
Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole, Rais'd on the seas, the surges to \
control- At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall; Prone to the deep, the \
stones disjointed fall Of the vast pile; the scatter'd ocean flies; Black \
sands, discolor'd froth, and mingled mud arise: The frighted billows roll, \
and seek the shores; Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars: Typhoeus, \
thrown beneath, by Jove's command, Astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the \
land, Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake, With wonder feels the \
weight press lighter on his back. The warrior god the Latian troops inspir'd, \
New strung their sinews, and their courage fir'd, But chills the Trojan \
hearts with cold affright: Then black despair precipitates their flight. When \
Pandarus beheld his brother kill'd, The town with fear and wild confusion \
fill'd, He turns the hinges of the heavy gate With both his hands, and adds \
his shoulders to the weight Some happier friends within the walls inclos'd; \
The rest shut out, to certain death expos'd: Fool as he was, and frantic in \
his care, T' admit young Turnus, and include the war! He thrust amid the \
crowd, securely bold, Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold. Too late his \
blazing buckler they descry, And sparkling fires that shot from either eye, \
His mighty members, and his ample breast, His rattling armor, and his crimson \
crest. Far from that hated face the Trojans fly, All but the fool who sought \
his destiny. Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd For Bitias' \
death, and threatens thus aloud: \"These are not Ardea's walls, nor this the \
town Amata proffers with Lavinia's crown: 'T is hostile earth you tread. Of \
hope bereft, No means of safe return by flight are left.\" To whom, with \
count'nance calm, and soul sedate, Thus Turnus: \"Then begin, and try thy \
fate: My message to the ghost of Priam bear; Tell him a new Achilles sent \
thee there.\" A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw, Rough in the \
rind, and knotted as it grew: With his full force he whirl'd it first around; \
But the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound: Imperial Juno turn'd the course \
before, And fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door. \"But hope not thou,\" \
said Turnus, \"when I strike, To shun thy fate: our force is not alike, Nor \
thy steel temper'd by the Lemnian god.\" Then rising, on his utmost stretch \
he stood, And aim'd from high: the full descending blow Cleaves the broad \
front and beardless cheeks in two. Down sinks the giant with a thund'ring \
sound: His pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground; Blood, brains, and \
foam gush from the gaping wound: Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel \
divides, And the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides. The Trojans fly from \
their approaching fate; And, had the victor then secur'd the gate, And to his \
troops without unclos'd the bars, One lucky day had ended all his wars. But \
boiling youth, and blind desire of blood, Push'd on his fury, to pursue the \
crowd. Hamstring'd behind, unhappy Gyges died; Then Phalaris is added to his \
side. The pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew, And their friends' arms \
against their fellows threw. Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies; \
Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies. Then Halius, Prytanis, \
Alcander fall- Ingag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall: But, whom they \
fear'd without, they found within. At last, tho' late, by Lynceus he was \
seen. He calls new succors, and assaults the prince: But weak his force, and \
vain is their defense. Turn'd to the right, his sword the hero drew, And at \
one blow the bold aggressor slew. He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so \
strong, The helm flies off, and bears the head along. Next him, the huntsman \
Amycus he kill'd, In darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd. Then Clytius fell \
beneath his fatal spear, And Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear: He fought \
with courage, and he sung the fight; Arms were his bus'ness, verses his \
delight. The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief, Their slaughter'd \
friends, and hasten their relief. Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken \
train, Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain. To save the living, and \
revenge the dead, Against one warrior's arms all Troy they led. \"O, void of \
sense and courage!\" Mnestheus cried, \"Where can you hope your coward heads \
to hide? Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run? One man, and in your \
camp inclos'd, you shun! Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast, And \
pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host? Forsaking honor, and renouncing fame, \
Your gods, your country, and your king you shame!\" This just reproach their \
virtue does excite: They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight. Now \
Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield, But with slow paces measures back \
the field, And inches to the walls, where Tiber's tide, Washing the camp, \
defends the weaker side. The more he loses, they advance the more, And tread \
in ev'ry step he trod before. They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by \
might They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight. As, compass'd with a \
wood of spears around, The lordly lion still maintains his ground; Grins \
horrible, retires, and turns again; Threats his distended paws, and shakes \
his mane; He loses while in vain he presses on, Nor will his courage let him \
dare to run: So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight, Moves tardy back, \
and just recedes from fight. Yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews, Twice \
breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues. But now they swarm, and, with \
fresh troops supplied, Come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side: Nor Juno, \
who sustain'd his arms before, Dares with new strength suffice th' exhausted \
store; For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down, To force th' invader \
from the frighted town. With labor spent, no longer can he wield The heavy \
fanchion, or sustain the shield, O'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they \
fling: The weapons round his hollow temples ring; His golden helm gives way, \
with stony blows Batter'd, and flat, and beaten to his brows. His crest is \
rash'd away; his ample shield Is falsified, and round with jav'lins fill'd. \
The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm; And Mnestheus lays hard load upon \
his helm. Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev'ry pore; With driving dust his \
cheeks are pasted o'er; Shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes; And vain \
efforts and hurtless blows he makes. Plung'd in the flood, and made the \
waters fly. The yellow god the welcome burthen bore, And wip'd the sweat, and \
wash'd away the gore; Then gently wafts him to the farther coast, And sends \
him safe to cheer his anxious host. BOOK X The gates of heav'n unfold: Jove \
summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he \
surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th' \
inferior world. From first to last, The sov'reign senate in degrees are \
plac'd. Then thus th' almighty sire began: \"Ye gods, Natives or denizens of \
blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This \
backward fate from what was first design'd? Why this protracted war, when my \
commands Pronounc'd a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on \
either part divides Our heav'ns, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides? A \
lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the \
doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid \
rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then \
is your time for faction and debate, For partial favor, and permitted hate. \
Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to \
peace.\" Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus \
replies at large: \"O pow'r immense, eternal energy, (For to what else \
protection can we fly?) Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare In \
fields, unpunish'd, and insult my care? How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his \
train, In shining arms, triumphant on the plain? Ev'n in their lines and \
trenches they contend, And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend: The \
town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats, With a red deluge, their \
increasing moats. Aeneas, ignorant, and far from thence, Has left a camp \
expos'd, without defense. This endless outrage shall they still sustain? \
Shall Troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again? A second siege my banish'd \
issue fears, And a new Diomede in arms appears. One more audacious mortal \
will be found; And I, thy daughter, wait another wound. Yet, if with fates \
averse, without thy leave, The Latian lands my progeny receive, Bear they the \
pains of violated law, And thy protection from their aid withdraw. But, if \
the gods their sure success foretell; If those of heav'n consent with those \
of hell, To promise Italy; who dare debate The pow'r of Jove, or fix another \
fate? What should I tell of tempests on the main, Of Aeolus usurping \
Neptune's reign? Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat T' inspire the matrons, \
and destroy the fleet? Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends, Solicits hell \
for aid, and arms the fiends. That new example wanted yet above: An act that \
well became the wife of Jove! Alecto, rais'd by her, with rage inflames The \
peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames. Imperial sway no more exalts my mind; \
(Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav'n was kind;) Now let my happier foes \
possess my place, Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race; And conquer they, \
whom you with conquest grace. Since you can spare, from all your wide \
command, No spot of earth, no hospitable land, Which may my wand'ring \
fugitives receive; (Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;) Then, \
father, (if I still may use that name,) By ruin'd Troy, yet smoking from the \
flame, I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care, Be freed from danger, and \
dismiss'd the war: Inglorious let him live, without a crown. The father may \
be cast on coasts unknown, Struggling with fate; but let me save the son. \
Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow'rs: In those recesses, and those sacred \
bow'rs, Obscurely let him rest; his right resign To promis'd empire, and his \
Julian line. Then Carthage may th' Ausonian towns destroy, Nor fear the race \
of a rejected boy. What profits it my son to scape the fire, Arm'd with his \
gods, and loaded with his sire; To pass the perils of the seas and wind; \
Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind; To reach th' Italian shores; if, \
after all, Our second Pergamus is doom'd to fall? Much better had he curb'd \
his high desires, And hover'd o'er his ill-extinguish'd fires. To Simois' \
banks the fugitives restore, And give them back to war, and all the woes \
before.\" Deep indignation swell'd Saturnia's heart: \"And must I own,\" she \
said, \"my secret smart- What with more decence were in silence kept, And, \
but for this unjust reproach, had slept? Did god or man your fav'rite son \
advise, With war unhop'd the Latians to surprise? By fate, you boast, and by \
the gods' decree, He left his native land for Italy! Confess the truth; by \
mad Cassandra, more Than Heav'n inspir'd, he sought a foreign shore! Did I \
persuade to trust his second Troy To the raw conduct of a beardless boy, With \
walls unfinish'd, which himself forsakes, And thro' the waves a wand'ring \
voyage takes? When have I urg'd him meanly to demand The Tuscan aid, and arm \
a quiet land? Did I or Iris give this mad advice, Or made the fool himself \
the fatal choice? You think it hard, the Latians should destroy With swords \
your Trojans, and with fires your Troy! Hard and unjust indeed, for men to \
draw Their native air, nor take a foreign law! That Turnus is permitted still \
to live, To whom his birth a god and goddess give! But yet is just and lawful \
for your line To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join; Realms, \
not your own, among your clans divide, And from the bridegroom tear the \
promis'd bride; Petition, while you public arms prepare; Pretend a peace, and \
yet provoke a war! 'T was giv'n to you, your darling son to shroud, To draw \
the dastard from the fighting crowd, And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud. \
From flaming fleets you turn'd the fire away, And chang'd the ships to \
daughters of the sea. But is my crime- the Queen of Heav'n offends, If she \
presume to save her suff'ring friends! Your son, not knowing what his foes \
decree, You say, is absent: absent let him be. Yours is Cythera, yours the \
Cyprian tow'rs, The soft recesses, and the sacred bow'rs. Why do you then \
these needless arms prepare, And thus provoke a people prone to war? Did I \
with fire the Trojan town deface, Or hinder from return your exil'd race? Was \
I the cause of mischief, or the man Whose lawless lust the fatal war began? \
Think on whose faith th' adult'rous youth relied; Who promis'd, who procur'd, \
the Spartan bride? When all th' united states of Greece combin'd, To purge \
the world of the perfidious kind, Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate: \
Your quarrels and complaints are now too late.\" Thus Juno. Murmurs rise, \
with mix'd applause, Just as they favor or dislike the cause. So winds, when \
yet unfledg'd in woods they lie, In whispers first their tender voices try, \
Then issue on the main with bellowing rage, And storms to trembling mariners \
presage. Then thus to both replied th' imperial god, Who shakes heav'n's \
axles with his awful nod. (When he begins, the silent senate stand With \
rev'rence, list'ning to the dread command: The clouds dispel; the winds their \
breath restrain; And the hush'd waves lie flatted on the main.) \"Celestials, \
your attentive ears incline! Since,\" said the god, \"the Trojans must not \
join In wish'd alliance with the Latian line; Since endless jarrings and \
immortal hate Tend but to discompose our happy state; The war henceforward be \
resign'd to fate: Each to his proper fortune stand or fall; Equal and \
unconcern'd I look on all. Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me; And both \
shall draw the lots their fates decree. Let these assault, if Fortune be \
their friend; And, if she favors those, let those defend: The Fates will find \
their way.\" The Thund'rer said, And shook the sacred honors of his head, \
Attesting Styx, th' inviolable flood, And the black regions of his brother \
god. Trembled the poles of heav'n, and earth confess'd the nod. This end the \
sessions had: the senate rise, And to his palace wait their sov'reign thro' \
the skies. Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes Within their walls the \
Trojan host inclose: They wound, they kill, they watch at ev'ry gate; Renew \
the fires, and urge their happy fate. Th' Aeneans wish in vain their wanted \
chief, Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief. Thin on the tow'rs they \
stand; and ev'n those few A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew. Yet in the \
face of danger some there stood: The two bold brothers of Sarpedon's blood, \
Asius and Acmon; both th' Assaraci; Young Haemon, and tho' young, resolv'd to \
die. With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join'd; Tibris and Castor, both of \
Lycian kind. From Acmon's hands a rolling stone there came, So large, it half \
deserv'd a mountain's name: Strong-sinew'd was the youth, and big of bone; \
His brother Mnestheus could not more have done, Or the great father of th' \
intrepid son. Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send; And some \
with darts, and some with stones defend. Amid the press appears the beauteous \
boy, The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy. His lovely face unarm'd, his \
head was bare; In ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair. His forehead \
circled with a diadem; Distinguish'd from the crowd, he shines a gem, \
Enchas'd in gold, or polish'd iv'ry set, Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet. \
Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war, Directing pointed arrows from afar, And \
death with poison arm'd- in Lydia born, Where plenteous harvests the fat \
fields adorn; Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands, And leaves a \
rich manure of golden sands. There Capys, author of the Capuan name, And \
there was Mnestheus too, increas'd in fame, Since Turnus from the camp he \
cast with shame. Thus mortal war was wag'd on either side. Meantime the hero \
cuts the nightly tide: For, anxious, from Evander when he went, He sought the \
Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon's tent; Expos'd the cause of coming to the chief; \
His name and country told, and ask'd relief; Propos'd the terms; his own \
small strength declar'd; What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar'd: What \
Turnus, bold and violent, design'd; Then shew'd the slipp'ry state of \
humankind, And fickle fortune; warn'd him to beware, And to his wholesome \
counsel added pray'r. Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs, And to the \
Trojan troops the Tuscan joins. They soon set sail; nor now the fates \
withstand; Their forces trusted with a foreign hand. Aeneas leads; upon his \
stern appear Two lions carv'd, which rising Ida bear- Ida, to wand'ring \
Trojans ever dear. Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate, Revolving war's \
events, and various fate. His left young Pallas kept, fix'd to his side, And \
oft of winds enquir'd, and of the tide; Oft of the stars, and of their wat'ry \
way; And what he suffer'd both by land and sea. Now, sacred sisters, open all \
your spring! The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing, Which follow'd great \
Aeneas to the war: Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare. A \
thousand youths brave Massicus obey, Borne in the Tiger thro' the foaming \
sea; From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care: For arms, light quivers, bows \
and shafts, they bear. Fierce Abas next: his men bright armor wore; His stern \
Apollo's golden statue bore. Six hundred Populonia sent along, All skill'd in \
martial exercise, and strong. Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins, An \
isle renown'd for steel, and unexhausted mines. Asylas on his prow the third \
appears, Who heav'n interprets, and the wand'ring stars; From offer'd \
entrails prodigies expounds, And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds. A \
thousand spears in warlike order stand, Sent by the Pisans under his command. \
Fair Astur follows in the wat'ry field, Proud of his manag'd horse and \
painted shield. Gravisca, noisome from the neighb'ring fen, And his own \
Caere, sent three hundred men; With those which Minio's fields and Pyrgi \
gave, All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave. Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras \
renew, And brave Cupavo follow'd but by few; Whose helm confess'd the lineage \
of the man, And bore, with wings display'd, a silver swan. Love was the fault \
of his fam'd ancestry, Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly. For \
Cycnus lov'd unhappy Phaeton, And sung his loss in poplar groves, alone, \
Beneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief. Heav'n heard his song, and \
hasten'd his relief, And chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair, And wing'd \
his flight, to chant aloft in air. His son Cupavo brush'd the briny flood: \
Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood, Who heav'd a rock, and, threat'ning \
still to throw, With lifted hands alarm'd the seas below: They seem'd to fear \
the formidable sight, And roll'd their billows on, to speed his flight. Ocnus \
was next, who led his native train Of hardy warriors thro' the wat'ry plain: \
The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream, From whence the Mantuan town derives \
the name- An ancient city, but of mix'd descent: Three sev'ral tribes compose \
the government; Four towns are under each; but all obey The Mantuan laws, and \
own the Tuscan sway. Hate to Mezentius arm'd five hundred more, Whom Mincius \
from his sire Benacus bore: Mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead \
cover'd o'er. These grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep With stretching oars \
at once the glassy deep. Him and his martial train the Triton bears; High on \
his poop the sea-green god appears: Frowning he seems his crooked shell to \
sound, And at the blast the billows dance around. A hairy man above the waist \
he shows; A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows; And ends a fish: his \
breast the waves divides, And froth and foam augment the murm'ring tides. \
Full thirty ships transport the chosen train For Troy's relief, and scour the \
briny main. Now was the world forsaken by the sun, And Phoebe half her \
nightly race had run. The careful chief, who never clos'd his eyes, Himself \
the rudder holds, the sails supplies. A choir of Nereids meet him on the \
flood, Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida's wood; But now, as many nymphs, \
the sea they sweep, As rode, before, tall vessels on the deep. They know him \
from afar; and in a ring Inclose the ship that bore the Trojan king. \
Cymodoce, whose voice excell'd the rest, Above the waves advanc'd her snowy \
breast; Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides The curling ocean, \
and corrects the tides. She spoke for all the choir, and thus began With \
pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man: \"Sleeps our lov'd lord? O \
goddess-born, awake! Spread ev'ry sail, pursue your wat'ry track, And haste \
your course. Your navy once were we, From Ida's height descending to the sea; \
Till Turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood, Presum'd to violate our holy wood. \
Then, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires profane (Unwillingly we broke our \
master's chain), And since have sought you thro' the Tuscan main. The mighty \
Mother chang'd our forms to these, And gave us life immortal in the seas. But \
young Ascanius, in his camp distress'd, By your insulting foes is hardly \
press'd. Th' Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host, Advance in order on the \
Latian coast: To cut their way the Daunian chief designs, Before their troops \
can reach the Trojan lines. Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light, \
First arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight: Thyself the fated sword of \
Vulcan wield, And bear aloft th' impenetrable shield. To-morrow's sun, unless \
my skill be vain, Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain.\" Parting, \
she spoke; and with immortal force Push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course; \
For well she knew the way. Impell'd behind, The ship flew forward, and \
outstripp'd the wind. The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause, The chief \
admires their speed, and happy omens draws. Then thus he pray'd, and fix'd on \
heav'n his eyes: \"Hear thou, great Mother of the deities. With turrets \
crown'd! (on Ida's holy hill Fierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy \
will.) Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight; And let thy Phrygians conquer \
in thy right.\" He said no more. And now renewing day Had chas'd the shadows \
of the night away. He charg'd the soldiers, with preventing care, Their flags \
to follow, and their arms prepare; Warn'd of th' ensuing fight, and bade 'em \
hope the war. Now, his lofty poop, he view'd below His camp incompass'd, and \
th' inclosing foe. His blazing shield, imbrac'd, he held on high; The camp \
receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply. Hope arms their courage: from \
their tow'rs they throw Their darts with double force, and drive the foe. \
Thus, at the signal giv'n, the cranes arise Before the stormy south, and \
blacken all the skies. King Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd, Till, \
looking back, the Trojan fleet he view'd, The seas with swelling canvas \
cover'd o'er, And the swift ships descending on the shore. The Latians saw \
from far, with dazzled eyes, The radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise, \
And dart diffusive fires around the field, And the keen glitt'ring the golden \
shield. Thus threat'ning comets, when by night they rise, Shoot sanguine \
streams, and sadden all the skies: So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights, \
Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright: Yet Turnus with \
undaunted mind is bent To man the shores, and hinder their descent, And thus \
awakes the courage of his friends: \"What you so long have wish'd, kind \
Fortune sends; In ardent arms to meet th' invading foe: You find, and find \
him at advantage now. Yours is the day: you need but only dare; Your swords \
will make you masters of the war. Your sires, your sons, your houses, and \
your lands, And dearest wifes, are all within your hands. Be mindful of the \
race from whence you came, And emulate in arms your fathers' fame. Now take \
the time, while stagg'ring yet they stand With feet unfirm, and prepossess \
the strand: Fortune befriends the bold.\" Nor more he said, But balanc'd whom \
to leave, and whom to lead; Then these elects, the landing to prevent; And \
those he leaves, to keep the city pent. Meantime the Trojan sends his troops \
ashore: Some are by boats expos'd, by bridges more. With lab'ring oars they \
bear along the strand, Where the tide languishes, and leap aland. Tarchon \
observes the coast with careful eyes, And, where no ford he finds, no water \
fries, Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar, But smoothly slide along, and \
swell the shore, That course he steer'd, and thus he gave command: \"Here ply \
your oars, and at all hazard land: Force on the vessel, that her keel may \
wound This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground. Let me securely land- I ask \
no more; Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore.\" This fiery speech \
inflames his fearful friends: They tug at ev'ry oar, and ev'ry stretcher \
bends; They run their ships aground; the vessels knock, (Thus forc'd ashore,) \
and tremble with the shock. Tarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood, \
Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood: She breaks her back; the loosen'd \
sides give way, And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea. Their broken oars \
and floating planks withstand Their passage, while they labor to the land, \
And ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand. Now Turnus leads his \
troops without delay, Advancing to the margin of the sea. The trumpets sound: \
Aeneas first assail'd The clowns new-rais'd and raw, and soon prevail'd. \
Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight; Great Theron, large of limbs, of \
giant height. He first in open field defied the prince: But armor scal'd with \
gold was no defense Against the fated sword, which open'd wide His plated \
shield, and pierc'd his naked side. Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others \
born, Was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn; Sacred, O Phoebus, from \
his birth to thee; For his beginning life from biting steel was free. Not far \
from him was Gyas laid along, Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and \
strong: Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail'd, Nor valor nor \
Herculean arms avail'd, Nor their fam'd father, wont in war to go With great \
Alcides, while he toil'd below. The noisy Pharos next receiv'd his death: \
Aeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling breath. Then wretched Cydon \
had receiv'd his doom, Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom, And sought \
with lust obscene polluted joys: The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys, \
Had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course Of the fierce champions, \
with united force. Sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound From his \
bright shield, some on his helmet sound: The rest had reach'd him; but his \
mother's care Prevented those, and turn'd aside in air. The prince then \
call'd Achates, to supply The spears that knew the way to victory- \"Those \
fatal weapons, which, inur'd to blood, In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood: \
Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain Against our foes, on this \
contended plain.\" He said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw; Which, \
wing'd with fate, thro' Maeon's buckler flew, Pierc'd all the brazen plates, \
and reach'd his heart: He stagger'd with intolerable smart. Alcanor saw; and \
reach'd, but reach'd in vain, His helping hand, his brother to sustain. A \
second spear, which kept the former course, From the same hand, and sent with \
equal force, His right arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft His use of both, \
and pinion'd down his left. Then Numitor from his dead brother drew Th' \
ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw: Preventing fate directs the lance \
awry, Which, glancing, only mark'd Achates' thigh. In pride of youth the \
Sabine Clausus came, And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim. The spear flew \
hissing thro' the middle space, And pierc'd his throat, directed at his face; \
It stopp'd at once the passage of his wind, And the free soul to flitting air \
resign'd: His forehead was the first that struck the ground; Lifeblood and \
life rush'd mingled thro' the wound. He slew three brothers of the Borean \
race, And three, whom Ismarus, their native place, Had sent to war, but all \
the sons of Thrace. Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads: The son of Neptune \
to his aid succeeds, Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand, These fight to \
keep, and those to win, the land. With mutual blood th' Ausonian soil is \
dyed, While on its borders each their claim decide. As wintry winds, \
contending in the sky, With equal force of lungs their titles try: They rage, \
they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n Stands without motion, and the tide \
undriv'n: Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield, They long suspend the \
fortune of the field. Both armies thus perform what courage can; Foot set to \
foot, and mingled man to man. But, in another part, th' Arcadian horse With \
ill success ingage the Latin force: For, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing \
down, Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown, They left their \
coursers, and, unus'd to fight On foot, were scatter'd in a shameful flight. \
Pallas, who with disdain and grief had view'd His foes pursuing, and his \
friends pursued, Us'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs, his last resource, \
With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force \"Which way, \
companions? whether would you run? By you yourselves, and mighty battles won, \
By my great sire, by his establish'd name, And early promise of my future \
fame; By my youth, emulous of equal right To share his honors- shun ignoble \
flight! Trust not your feet: your hands must hew way Thro' yon black body, \
and that thick array: 'T is thro' that forward path that we must come; There \
lies our way, and that our passage home. Nor pow'rs above, nor destinies \
below Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go, With mortal hands to meet \
a mortal foe. See on what foot we stand: a scanty shore, The sea behind, our \
enemies before; No passage left, unless we swim the main; Or, forcing these, \
the Trojan trenches gain.\" This said, he strode with eager haste along, And \
bore amidst the thickest of the throng. Lagus, the first he met, with fate to \
foe, Had heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw: Stooping, the spear \
descended on his chine, Just where the bone distinguished either loin: It \
stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay, That scarce the victor forc'd the steel \
away. Hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow To wish'd revenge, the \
prince prevents his blow; For, warding his at once, at once he press'd, And \
plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast. Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust, \
Who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust. And, after him, the Daucian \
twins were slain, Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain; So wondrous like \
in feature, shape, and size, As caus'd an error in their parents' eyes- \
Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides The nice distinction, and their \
fate divides: For Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris' hand, Dismember'd, \
sought its owner on the strand: The trembling fingers yet the fauchion \
strain, And threaten still th' intended stroke in vain. Now, to renew the \
charge, th' Arcadians came: Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame, \
And grief, with anger mix'd, their minds inflame. Then, with a casual blow \
was Rhoeteus slain, Who chanc'd, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain: The \
flying spear was after Ilus sent; But Rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant: \
From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled, The lance, athwart his body, laid \
him dead: Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound, And intercepted fate, \
he spurn'd the ground. As when, in summer, welcome winds arise, The watchful \
shepherd to the forest flies, And fires the midmost plants; contagion \
spreads, And catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads; Around the forest \
flies the furious blast, And all the leafy nation sinks at last, And Vulcan \
rides in triumph o'er the waste; The pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory, \
Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky: So Pallas' troops their \
scatter'd strength unite, And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight. \
Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood; But first collected in his arms he \
stood: Advancing then, he plied the spear so well, Ladon, Demodocus, and \
Pheres fell. Around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand, And from \
Strymonius hew'd his better hand, Held up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a \
stone At Thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone: It struck beneath the \
space of either eye; And blood, and mingled brains, together fly. Deep \
skill'd in future fates, Halesus' sire Did with the youth to lonely groves \
retire: But, when the father's mortal race was run, Dire destiny laid hold \
upon the son, And haul'd him to the war, to find, beneath Th' Evandrian \
spear, a memorable death. Pallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws, To \
Tuscan Tiber thus address'd his vows: \"O sacred stream, direct my flying \
dart, And give to pass the proud Halesus' heart! His arms and spoils thy holy \
oak shall bear.\" Pleas'd with the bribe, the god receiv'd his pray'r: For, \
while his shield protects a friend distress'd, The dart came driving on, and \
pierc'd his breast. But Lausus, no small portion of the war, Permits not \
panic fear to reign too far, Caus'd by the death of so renown'd a knight; But \
by his own example cheers the fight. Fierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the \
stay Of Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day. The Phrygian troops escap'd \
the Greeks in vain: They, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain. To the \
rude shock of war both armies came; Their leaders equal, and their strength \
the same. The rear so press'd the front, they could not wield Their angry \
weapons, to dispute the field. Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there: Of \
equal youth and beauty both appear, But both by fate forbid to breathe their \
native air. Their congress in the field great Jove withstands: Both doom'd to \
fall, but fall by greater hands. Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief Of \
Lausus' danger, urging swift relief. With his driv'n chariot he divides the \
crowd, And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud: \"Let none presume his \
needless aid to join; Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine: To this \
right hand is Pallas only due; O were his father here, my just revenge to \
view!\" From the forbidden space his men retir'd. Pallas their awe, and his \
stern words, admir'd; Survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight, Struck \
with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height. Then to the king: \"Your empty \
vaunts forbear; Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear; Alive or dead, I \
shall deserve a name; Jove is impartial, and to both the same.\" He said, and \
to the void advanc'd his pace: Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face. Then \
Turnus, from his chariot leaping light, Address'd himself on foot to single \
fight. And, as a lion- when he spies from far A bull that seems to meditate \
the war, Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand- Runs roaring downward \
from his hilly stand: Imagine eager Turnus not more slow, To rush from high \
on his unequal foe. Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance Within due \
distance of his flying lance, Prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try \
If fortune would his want of force supply; And thus to Heav'n and Hercules \
address'd: \"Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest, His son adjures you by \
those holy rites, That hospitable board, those genial nights; Assist my great \
attempt to gain this prize, And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes, His \
ravish'd spoils.\" 'T was heard, the vain request; Alcides mourn'd, and \
stifled sighs within his breast. Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began: \
\"Short bounds of life are set to mortal man. 'T is virtue's work alone to \
stretch the narrow span. So many sons of gods, in bloody fight, Around the \
walls of Troy, have lost the light: My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe; Nor \
I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow. Ev'n Turnus shortly shall resign his \
breath, And stands already on the verge of death.\" This said, the god \
permits the fatal fight, But from the Latian fields averts his sight. Now \
with full force his spear young Pallas threw, And, having thrown, his shining \
fauchion drew The steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint, And mark'd it \
slightly with the glancing point, Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance \
drew, And pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw: Then, as the winged \
weapon whizz'd along, \"See now,\" said he, \"whose arm is better strung.\" \
The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd By plates of ir'n, which o'er \
the shield were laid: Thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd, His \
corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his heart at last. In vain the youth tugs at the \
broken wood; The soul comes issuing with the vital blood: He falls; his arms \
upon his body sound; And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground. Turnus \
bestrode the corpse: \"Arcadians, hear,\" Said he; \"my message to your \
master bear: Such as the sire deserv'd, the son I send; It costs him dear to \
be the Phrygians' friend. The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow, Unask'd, to \
rest his wand'ring ghost below.\" He said, and trampled down with all the \
force Of his left foot, and spurn'd the wretched corse; Then snatch'd the \
shining belt, with gold inlaid; The belt Eurytion's artful hands had made, \
Where fifty fatal brides, express'd to sight, All in the compass of one \
mournful night, Depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light. In an ill hour \
insulting Turnus tore Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore. O mortals, \
blind in fate, who never know To bear high fortune, or endure the low! The \
time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain, Shall wish untouch'd the trophies \
of the slain; Shall wish the fatal belt were far away, And curse the dire \
remembrance of the day. The sad Arcadians, from th' unhappy field, Bear back \
the breathless body on a shield. O grace and grief of war! at once restor'd, \
With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor'd! One day first sent thee to the \
fighting field, Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd; One day beheld \
thee dead, and borne upon thy shield. This dismal news, not from uncertain \
fame, But sad spectators, to the hero came: His friends upon the brink of \
ruin stand, Unless reliev'd by his victorious hand. He whirls his sword \
around, without delay, And hews thro' adverse foes an ample way, To find \
fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud: Evander, Pallas, all that friendship \
ow'd To large deserts, are present to his eyes; His plighted hand, and \
hospitable ties. Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred, He took in fight, \
and living victims led, To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire, In \
sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire. At Magus next he threw: he stoop'd below \
The flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow; Then, creeping, clasp'd the \
hero's knees, and pray'd: \"By young Iulus, by thy father's shade, O spare my \
life, and send me back to see My longing sire, and tender progeny! A lofty \
house I have, and wealth untold, In silver ingots, and in bars of gold: All \
these, and sums besides, which see no day, The ransom of this one poor life \
shall pay. If I survive, will Troy the less prevail? A single soul's too \
light to turn the scale.\" He said. The hero sternly thus replied: \"Thy bars \
and ingots, and the sums beside, Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus \
broke All rules of war by one relentless stroke, When Pallas fell: so deems, \
nor deems alone My father's shadow, but my living son.\" Thus having said, of \
kind remorse bereft, He seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left; Then \
with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd, Up to the hilts his shining \
fauchion sheath'd. Apollo's priest, Emonides, was near; His holy fillets on \
his front appear; Glitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd; Much of his \
god, more of his purple, proud. Him the fierce Trojan follow'd thro' the \
field: The holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield, The prince stood o'er the \
priest, and, at one blow, Sent him an off'ring to the shades below. His arms \
Seresthus on his shoulders bears, Design'd a trophy to the God of Wars. \
Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight, And Umbro, born upon the mountains' \
height. The champion cheers his troops t' encounter those, And seeks revenge \
himself on other foes. At Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow, Both \
shield and arm to ground together go. Anxur had boasted much of magic charms, \
And thought he wore impenetrable arms, So made by mutter'd spells; and, from \
the spheres, Had life secur'd, in vain, for length of years. Then Tarquitus \
the field triumph trod; A nymph his mother, his sire a god. Exulting in \
bright arms, he braves the prince: With his protended lance he makes defense; \
Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on, Arrests his better hand, and \
drags him down; Stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay, Vain tales \
inventing, and prepar'd to pray, Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood, \
Then sunk, and roll'd along the sand in blood. The vengeful victor thus \
upbraids the slain: \"Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain; Lie \
there, inglorious, and without a tomb, Far from thy mother and thy native \
home, Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey, Or thrown for food to \
monsters of the sea.\" On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran, Two chiefs of \
Turnus, and who led his van. They fled for fear; with these, he chas'd along \
Camers the yellow-lock'd, and Numa strong; Both great in arms, and both were \
fair and young. Camers was son to Volscens lately slain, In wealth surpassing \
all the Latian train, And in Amycla fix'd his silent easy reign. And, as \
Aegaeon, when with heav'n he strove, Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove; \
Mov'd all his hundred hands, provok'd the war, Defied the forky lightning \
from afar; At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires, And flash for flash \
returns, and fires for fires; In his right hand as many swords he wields, And \
takes the thunder on as many shields: With strength like his, the Trojan hero \
stood; And soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd, When once his \
fauchion found the taste of blood. With fury scarce to be conceiv'd, he flew \
Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew. They, when they see the fiery \
chief advance, And pushing at their chests his pointed lance, Wheel'd with so \
swift a motion, mad with fear, They threw their master headlong from the \
chair. They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before They bear the \
bounding chariot to the shore. Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains, With \
two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins, And Lucagus the lofty seat \
maintains: Bold brethren both. The former wav'd in air His flaming sword: \
Aeneas couch'd his spear, Unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear. Then \
Liger thus: \"Thy confidence is vain To scape from hence, as from the Trojan \
plain: Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode, Nor this the chariot \
where Achilles rode; Nor Venus' veil is here, near Neptune's shield; Thy \
fatal hour is come, and this the field.\" Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the \
Trojan Return'd his answer with his flying spear. As Lucagus, to lash his \
horses, bends, Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends, Prepar'd for \
fight; the fatal dart arrives, And thro' the borders of his buckler drives; \
Pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound, Cast from his chariot, \
roll'd him on the ground. Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite: \
\"Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight; Vain shadows did not force \
their swift retreat; But you yourself forsake your empty seat.\" He said, and \
seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein; For Liger lay already on the plain, By the \
same shock: then, stretching out his hands, The recreant thus his wretched \
life demands: \"Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man! By her and him from \
whom thy breath began, Who form'd thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare This \
forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's pray'r.\" Thus much he spoke, and more \
he would have said; But the stern hero turn'd aside his head, And cut him \
short: \"I hear another man; You talk'd not thus before the fight began. Now \
take your turn; and, as a brother should, Attend your brother to the Stygian \
flood.\" Then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent, And the soul issued \
at the gaping vent. As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground, Thus \
rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around. At length Ascanius and the \
Trojan train Broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain. Meantime the King \
of Gods and Mortal Man Held conference with his queen, and thus began: \"My \
sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife, Still think you Venus' aid supports \
the strife- Sustains her Trojans- or themselves, alone, With inborn valor \
force their fortune on? How fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd! Judge if \
such warriors want immortal aid.\" To whom the goddess with the charming \
eyes, Soft in her tone, submissively replies: \"Why, O my sov'reign lord, \
whose frown I fear, And cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear; Why urge you \
thus my grief? when, if I still (As once I was) were mistress of your will, \
From your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife Might gain the grace of \
length'ning Turnus' life, Securely snatch him from the fatal fight, And give \
him to his aged father's sight. Now let him perish, since you hold it good, \
And glut the Trojans with his pious blood. Yet from our lineage he derives \
his name, And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came; Yet he devoutly \
pays you rites divine, And offers daily incense at your shrine.\" Then \
shortly thus the sov'reign god replied: \"Since in my pow'r and goodness you \
confide, If for a little space, a lengthen'd span, You beg reprieve for this \
expiring man, I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence From instant fate, \
and can so far dispense. But, if some secret meaning lies beneath, To save \
the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death, Or if a farther thought you \
entertain, To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain.\" To whom the \
goddess thus, with weeping eyes: \"And what if that request, your tongue \
denies, Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve, But length of \
certain life, to Turnus give? Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth, \
If my presaging soul divines with truth; Which, O! I wish, might err thro' \
causeless fears, And you (for you have pow'r) prolong his years!\" Thus \
having said, involv'd in clouds, she flies, And drives a storm before her \
thro' the skies. Swift she descends, alighting on the plain, Where the fierce \
foes a dubious fight maintain. Of air condens'd a specter soon she made; And, \
what Aeneas was, such seem'd the shade. Adorn'd with Dardan arms, the phantom \
bore His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore; This hand appear'd a shining \
sword to wield,. And that sustain'd an imitated shield. With manly mien he \
stalk'd along the ground, Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound. (Thus \
haunting ghosts appear to waking sight, Or dreadful visions in our dreams by \
night.) The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare, And flourishes his empty \
sword in air. At this, advancing, Turnus hurl'd his spear: The phantom \
wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for fear. Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled, \
And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed. \"Whether, O coward?\" (thus he \
calls aloud, Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,) \"Why thus \
forsake your bride! Receive from me The fated land you sought so long by sea.\
\" He said, and, brandishing at once his blade, With eager pace pursued the \
flying shade. By chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore, Which from old \
Clusium King Osinius bore: The plank was ready laid for safe ascent; For \
shelter there the trembling shadow bent, And skipp't and skulk'd, and under \
hatches went. Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste, Ascends the plank, and \
to the galley pass'd. Scarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's hand The \
haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land. With wind in poop, the vessel \
plows the sea, And measures back with speed her former way. Meantime Aeneas \
seeks his absent foe, And sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below. The \
guileful phantom now forsook the shroud, And flew sublime, and vanish'd in a \
cloud. Too late young Turnus the delusion found, Far on the sea, still making \
from the ground. Then, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame, With sense of \
honor stung, and forfeit fame, Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd, \
His hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast; \"O Jove!\" he cried, \"for \
what offense have Deserv'd to bear this endless infamy? Whence am I forc'd, \
and whether am I borne? How, and with what reproach, shall I return? Shall \
ever I behold the Latian plain, Or see Laurentum's lofty tow'rs again? What \
will they say of their deserting chief The war was mine: I fly from their \
relief; I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave; And ev'n from hence their \
dying groans receive. Here, overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie; There, \
scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly. Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down \
alive! Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve! On sands or shelves the \
splitting vessel drive; Or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore, Where no \
Rutulian eyes may see me more, Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious \
Fame, Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.\" Thus Turnus rav'd, \
and various fates revolv'd: The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd. \
And now the sword, and now the sea took place, That to revenge, and this to \
purge disgrace. Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main, By stretch of \
arms the distant shore to gain. Thrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the \
flood; But Juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood. And thrice repress'd his \
rage; strong gales supplied, And push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide. At \
length she lands him on his native shores, And to his father's longing arms \
restores. Meantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius arm'd, Succeeding Turnus, \
with his ardor warm'd His fainting friends, reproach'd their shameful flight, \
Repell'd the victors, and renew'd the fight. Against their king the Tuscan \
troops conspire; Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire Of wish'd \
revenge: on him, and him alone, All hands employ'd, and all their darts are \
thrown. He, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd, To raging winds and roaring \
waves oppos'd, From his proud summit looking down, disdains Their empty \
menace, and unmov'd remains. Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead, Then \
Latagus, and Palmus as he fled. At Latagus a weighty stone he flung: His face \
was flatted, and his helmet rung. But Palmus from behind receives his wound; \
Hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground: His crest and armor, from \
his body torn, Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn. Evas and Mimas, \
both of Troy, he slew. Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew, Born on that \
fatal night, when, big with fire, The queen produc'd young Paris to his sire: \
But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain, Unthinking Mimas on the Latian \
plain. And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred, With forest mast and \
fatt'ning marshes fed, When once he sees himself in toils inclos'd, By \
huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd- He whets his tusks, and turns, and \
dares the war; Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar: All keep aloof, \
and safely shout around; But none presumes to give a nearer wound: He frets \
and froths, erects his bristled hide, And shakes a grove of lances from his \
side: Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir'd, And just revenge against \
the tyrant fir'd, Their darts with clamor at a distance drive, And only keep \
the languish'd war alive. From Coritus came Acron to the fight, Who left his \
spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate night. Mezentius sees him thro' the \
squadrons ride, Proud of the purple favors of his bride. Then, as a hungry \
lion, who beholds A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds, Or beamy stag, \
that grazes on the plain- He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane, He \
grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws; The prey lies panting underneath his \
paws: He fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er With unchew'd morsels, \
while he churns the gore: So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes, And first \
unhappy Acron overthrows: Stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy \
ground; The lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the wound. Then with \
disdain the haughty victor view'd Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued, Nor \
thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound, But, running, gain'd th' \
advantage of the ground: Then turning short, he met him face to face, To give \
his victor the better grace. Orodes falls, equal fight oppress'd: Mezentius \
fix'd his foot upon his breast, And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries: \
\"Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!\" The fields around with Io Paean! \
ring; And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king. At this the \
vanquish'd, with his dying breath, Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in \
death: \"Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain: Like death attends \
thee on this fatal plain.\" Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied: \
\"For what belongs to me, let Jove provide; But die thou first, whatever \
chance ensue.\" He said, and from the wound the weapon drew. A hov'ring mist \
came swimming o'er his sight, And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night. By \
Caedicus, Alcathous was slain; Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain; Orses the \
strong to greater strength must yield; He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo \
kill'd. Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew, Who from Lycaon's blood his \
lineage drew. But from his headstrong horse his fate he found, Who threw his \
master, as he made a bound: The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground; \
Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails: The Trojan sinks, and Neptune's \
son prevails. Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride, To single fight the \
boldest foe defied; Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame, And not belied his \
mighty father's fame. Salius to death the great Antronius sent: But the same \
fate the victor underwent, Slain by Nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw The \
flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow. Thus equal deaths are dealt with \
equal chance; By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance: Victors and \
vanquish'd, in the various field, Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield. The \
gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife, And mourn the miseries of human \
life. Above the rest, two goddesses appear Concern'd for each: here Venus, \
Juno there. Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes Her scourge aloft, and \
crest of hissing snakes. Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain, \
Brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain, Where tow'ring in the \
midmost rank she stood, Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood. (When with \
his brawny breast he cuts the waves, His shoulders scarce the topmost billow \
laves), Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread, Deep fix'd in earth; \
in clouds he hides his head. The Trojan prince beheld him from afar, And \
dauntless undertook the doubtful war. Collected in his strength, and like a \
rock, Pois'd on his base, Mezentius stood the shock. He stood, and, measuring \
first with careful eyes The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries: \"My \
strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke! (Those only gods Mezentius \
will invoke.) His armor, from the Trojan pirate torn, By my triumphant Lausus \
shall be worn.\" He said; and with his utmost force he threw The massy spear, \
which, hissing as it flew, Reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the \
course; But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force Took a new bent \
obliquely, and betwixt The side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd. Anthores had \
from Argos travel'd far, Alcides' friend, and brother of the war; Till, tir'd \
with toils, fair Italy he chose, And in Evander's palace sought repose. Now, \
falling by another's wound, his eyes He cast to heav'n, on Argos thinks, and \
dies. The pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent; The shield gave way; thro' \
treble plates it went Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd, And three bull \
hides which round the buckler fold. All these it pass'd, resistless in the \
course, Transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force. The gaping wound \
gush'd out a crimson flood. The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood, His \
faunchion drew, to closer fight address'd, And with new force his fainting \
foe oppress'd. His father's peril Lausus view'd with grief; He sigh'd, he \
wept, he ran to his relief. And here, heroic youth, 't is here I must To thy \
immortal memory be just, And sing an act so noble and so new, Posterity will \
scarce believe 't is true. Pain'd with his wound, and useless for the fight, \
The father sought to save himself by flight: Incumber'd, slow he dragg'd the \
spear along, Which pierc'd his thigh, and in his buckler hung. The pious \
youth, resolv'd on death, below The lifted sword springs forth to face the \
foe; Protects his parent, and prevents the blow. Shouts of applause ran \
ringing thro' the field, To see the son the vanquish'd father shield. All, \
fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive, And with a storm of darts to \
distance drive The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far, On his Vulcanian \
orb sustain'd the war. As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind, The \
plowman, passenger, and lab'ring hind For shelter to the neighb'ring covert \
fly, Or hous'd, or safe in hollow caverns lie; But, that o'erblown, when \
heav'n above 'em smiles, Return to travel, and renew their toils: Aeneas \
thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side, The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide; \
And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat'ning cried: \"Why wilt thou rush \
to certain death, and rage In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age, Betray'd \
by pious love?\" Nor, thus forborne, The youth desists, but with insulting \
scorn Provokes the ling'ring prince, whose patience, tir'd, Gave place; and \
all his breast with fury fir'd. For now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd \
shears; And lifted high the flaming sword appears, Which, full descending \
with a frightful sway, Thro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way, And \
buried deep in his fair bosom lay. The purple streams thro' the thin armor \
strove, And drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his mother wove; And life at length \
forsook his heaving heart, Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart. But when, \
with blood and paleness all o'erspread, The pious prince beheld young Lausus \
dead, He griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought Of his own filial love, \
a sadly pleasing thought: Then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said: \
\"Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid To love so great, to such \
transcendent store Of early worth, and sure presage of more? Accept whate'er \
Aeneas can afford; Untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword; And all that \
pleas'd thee living, still remain Inviolate, and sacred to the slain. Thy \
body on thy parents I bestow, To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know, Or \
have a sense of human things below. There to thy fellow ghosts with glory \
tell: ''T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell.'\" With this, his distant \
friends he beckons near, Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear: \
Himself assists to lift him from the ground, With clotted locks, and blood \
that well'd from out the wound. Meantime, his father, now no father, stood, \
And wash'd his wounds by Tiber's yellow flood: Oppress'd with anguish, \
panting, and o'erspent, His fainting limbs against an oak he leant. A bough \
his brazen helmet did sustain; His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain: A \
chosen train of youth around him stand; His drooping head was rested on his \
hand: His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought; And all on Lausus ran his \
restless thought. Careful, concern'd his danger to prevent, He much enquir'd, \
and many a message sent To warn him from the field- alas! in vain! Behold, \
his mournful followers bear him slain! O'er his broad shield still gush'd the \
yawning wound, And drew a bloody trail along the ground. Far off he heard \
their cries, far off divin'd The dire event, with a foreboding mind. With \
dust he sprinkled first his hoary head; Then both his lifted hands to heav'n \
he spread; Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said: \"What joys, alas! \
could this frail being give, That I have been so covetous to live? To see my \
son, and such a son, resign His life, a ransom for preserving mine! And am I \
then preserv'd, and art thou lost? How much too dear has that redemption \
cost! 'T is now my bitter banishment I feel: This is a wound too deep for \
time to heal. My guilt thy growing virtues did defame; My blackness blotted \
thy unblemish'd name. Chas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and exil'd For foul \
misdeeds, were punishments too mild: I ow'd my people these, and, from their \
hate, With less resentment could have borne my fate. And yet I live, and yet \
sustain the sight Of hated men, and of more hated light: But will not long.\" \
With that he rais'd from ground His fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his \
wound; Yet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd With pains or perils, for \
his courser call'd Well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress With \
daily care, and mounted with success; His aid in arms, his ornament in peace. \
Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke, The steed seem'd sensible, while \
thus he spoke: \"O Rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me- If life and long \
were terms that could agree! This day thou either shalt bring back the head \
And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead; This day thou either shalt revenge my \
woe, For murther'd Lausus, on his cruel foe; Or, if inexorable fate deny Our \
conquest, with thy conquer'd master die: For, after such a lord, rest secure, \
Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure.\" He said; and straight \
th' officious courser kneels, To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills \
With pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd His glitt'ring helm, which \
terribly was grac'd With waving horsehair, nodding from afar; Then spurr'd \
his thund'ring steed amidst the war. Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to \
madness wrought, Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought Of inborn \
worth, his lab'ring soul oppress'd, Roll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his \
breast. Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name: The loud repeated voice to \
glad Aeneas came. \"Great Jove,\" he said, \"and the far-shooting god, \
Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!\" He spoke no more; but \
hasten'd, void of fear, And threaten'd with his long protended spear. To whom \
Mezentius thus: \"Thy vaunts are vain. My Lausus lies extended on the plain: \
He's lost! thy conquest is already won; The wretched sire is murther'd in the \
son. Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy. Forbear thy threats: my bus'ness \
is to die; But first receive this parting legacy.\" He said; and straight a \
whirling dart he sent; Another after, and another went. Round in a spacious \
ring he rides the field, And vainly plies th' impenetrable shield. Thrice \
rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd, Turn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb \
withstood The strokes, and bore about an iron wood. Impatient of delay, and \
weary grown, Still to defend, and to defend alone, To wrench the darts which \
in his buckler light, Urg'd and o'er-labor'd in unequal fight; At length \
resolv'd, he throws with all his force Full at the temples of the warrior \
horse. Just where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear Made way, and \
stood transfix'd thro' either ear. Seiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd with \
fright, The wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright, Lights on his feet \
before; his hoofs behind Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind. Down \
comes the rider headlong from his height: His horse came after with unwieldy \
weight, And, flound'ring forward, pitching on his head, His lord's incumber'd \
shoulder overlaid. From either host, the mingled shouts and cries Of Trojans \
and Rutulians rend the skies. Aeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal sword High \
o'er his head, with this reproachful word: \"Now; where are now thy vaunts, \
the fierce disdain Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?\" Struggling, \
and wildly staring on the skies, With scarce recover'd sight he thus replies: \
\"Why these insulting words, this waste of breath, To souls undaunted, and \
secure of death? 'T is no dishonor for the brave to die, Nor came I here with \
hope victory; Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design: As I had us'd my \
fortune, use thou thine. My dying son contracted no such band; The gift is \
hateful from his murd'rer's hand. For this, this only favor let me sue, If \
pity can to conquer'd foes be due: Refuse it not; but let my body have The \
last retreat of humankind, a grave. Too well I know th' insulting people's \
hate; Protect me from their vengeance after fate: This refuge for my poor \
remains provide, And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side.\" He said, and to \
the sword his throat applied. The crimson stream distain'd his arms around, \
And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound. BOOK XI Scarce had the \
rosy Morning rais'd her head Above the waves, and left her wat'ry bed; The \
pious chief, whom double cares attend For his unburied soldiers and his \
friend, Yet first to Heav'n perform'd a victor's vows: He bar'd an ancient \
oak of all her boughs; Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac'd, Which \
with the spoils of his dead foe he grac'd. The coat of arms by proud \
Mezentius worn, Now on a naked snag in triumph borne, Was hung on high, and \
glitter'd from afar, A trophy sacred to the God of War. Above his arms, fix'd \
on the leafless wood, Appear'd his plumy crest, besmear'd with blood: His \
brazen buckler on the left was seen; Truncheons of shiver'd lances hung \
between; And on the right was placed his corslet, bor'd; And to the neck was \
tied his unavailing sword. A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man, Who \
thus, conspicuous in the midst, began: \"Our toils, my friends, are crown'd \
with sure success; The greater part perform'd, achieve the less. Now follow \
cheerful to the trembling town; Press but an entrance, and presume it won. \
Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies, As the first fruits of war, a \
sacrifice. Turnus shall fall extended on the plain, And, in this omen, is \
already slain. Prepar'd in arms, pursue your happy chance; That none unwarn'd \
may plead his ignorance, And I, at Heav'n's appointed hour, may find Your \
warlike ensigns waving in the wind. Meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps \
prepare, Due to your dead companions of the war: The last respect the living \
can bestow, To shield their shadows from contempt below. That conquer'd earth \
be theirs, for which they fought, And which for us with their own blood they \
bought; But first the corpse of our unhappy friend To the sad city of Evander \
send, Who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom, Was hurried hence by too \
severe a doom.\" Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, Where, new in \
death, lamented Pallas lay. Acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd \
The father's trust; and now the son he serv'd With equal faith, but less \
auspicious care. Th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share. A troop of \
Trojans mix'd with these appear, And mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair. \
Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; All beat their breasts, and \
echoes rend the sky. They rear his drooping forehead from the ground; But, \
when Aeneas view'd the grisly wound Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore, And \
the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore; First, melting into tears, the \
pious man Deplor'd so sad a sight, then thus began: \"Unhappy youth! when \
Fortune gave the rest Of my full wishes, she refus'd the best! She came; but \
brought not thee along, to bless My longing eyes, and share in my success: \
She grudg'd thy safe return, the triumphs due To prosp'rous valor, in the \
public view. Not thus I promis'd, when thy father lent Thy needless succor \
with a sad consent; Embrac'd me, parting for th' Etrurian land, And sent me \
to possess a large command. He warn'd, and from his own experience told, Our \
foes were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold. And now perhaps, in hopes of thy \
return, Rich odors on his loaded altars burn, While we, with vain officious \
pomp, prepare To send him back his portion of the war, A bloody breathless \
body, which can owe No farther debt, but to the pow'rs below. The wretched \
father, ere his race is run, Shall view the fun'ral honors of his son. These \
are my triumphs of the Latian war, Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted \
care! And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see A son whose death disgrac'd \
his ancestry; Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd: Thy Pallas no \
dishonest wound receiv'd. He died no death to make thee wish, too late, Thou \
hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate: But what a champion has th' \
Ausonian coast, And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!\" Thus having \
mourn'd, he gave the word around, To raise the breathless body from the \
ground; And chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all His warlike troops, to \
wait the funeral, To bear him back and share Evander's grief: A \
well-becoming, but a weak relief. Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier, \
Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear. The body on this rural hearse is \
borne: Strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn. All pale he lies, \
and looks a lovely flow'r, New cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r: \
Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below, No more to mother earth or the green stern \
shall owe. Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost, Of purple woven, \
and with gold emboss'd, For ornament the Trojan hero brought, Which with her \
hands Sidonian Dido wrought. One vest array'd the corpse; and one they spread \
O'er his clos'd eyes, and wrapp'd around his head, That, when the yellow hair \
in flame should fall, The catching fire might burn the golden caul. Besides, \
the spoils of foes in battle slain, When he descended on the Latian plain; \
Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led In long array- th' \
achievements of the dead. Then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear Th' \
unhappy captives, marching in the rear, Appointed off'rings in the victor's \
name, To sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral flame. Inferior trophies by \
the chiefs are borne; Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn; And fair \
inscriptions fix'd, and titles read Of Latian leaders conquer'd by the dead. \
Acoetes on his pupil's corpse attends, With feeble steps, supported by his \
friends. Pausing at ev'ry pace, in sorrow drown'd, Betwixt their arms he \
sinks upon the ground; Where grov'ling while he lies in deep despair, He \
beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair. The champion's chariot next is \
seen to roll, Besmear'd with hostile blood, and honorably foul. To close the \
pomp, Aethon, the steed of state, Is led, the fun'rals of his lord to wait. \
Stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace He walks; and the big tears run \
rolling down his face. The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest, Are borne \
behind: the victor seiz'd the rest. The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely \
sound; The pikes and lances trail along the ground. Thus while the Trojan and \
Arcadian horse To Pallantean tow'rs direct their course, In long procession \
rank'd, the pious chief Stopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to grief: \"The \
public care,\" he said, \"which war attends, Diverts our present woes, at \
least suspends. Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell! Hail, holy \
relics! and a last farewell!\" He said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd, \
Restrained his tears, and to the camp return'd. Now suppliants, from \
Laurentum sent, demand A truce, with olive branches in their hand; Obtest his \
clemency, and from the plain Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain. \
They plead, that none those common rites deny To conquer'd foes that in fair \
battle die. All cause of hate was ended in their death; Nor could he war with \
bodies void of breath. A king, they hop'd, would hear a king's request, Whose \
son he once was call'd, and once his guest. Their suit, which was too just to \
be denied, The hero grants, and farther thus replied: \"O Latian princes, how \
severe a fate In causeless quarrels has involv'd your state, And arm'd \
against an unoffending man, Who sought your friendship ere the war began! You \
beg a truce, which I would gladly give, Not only for the slain, but those who \
live. I came not hither but by Heav'n's command, And sent by fate to share \
the Latian land. Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied My proffer'd \
friendship, and my promis'd bride; Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try \
His cause in arms, to conquer or to die. My right and his are in dispute: the \
slain Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain. In equal arms let us alone \
contend; And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. This is the way (so \
tell him) to possess The royal virgin, and restore the peace. Bear this \
message back, with ample leave, That your slain friends may fun'ral rites \
receive.\" Thus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd, Stood mute a while, and \
on each other gaz'd. Drances, their chief, who harbor'd in his breast Long \
hate to Turnus, as his foe profess'd, Broke silence first, and to the godlike \
man, With graceful action bowing, thus began: \"Auspicious prince, in arms a \
mighty name, But yet whose actions far transcend your fame; Would I your \
justice or your force express, Thought can but equal; and all words are less. \
Your answer we shall thankfully relate, And favors granted to the Latian \
state. If wish'd success our labor shall attend, Think peace concluded, and \
the king your friend: Let Turnus leave the realm to your command, And seek \
alliance in some other land: Build you the city which your fates assign; We \
shall be proud in the great work to join.\" Thus Drances; and his words so \
well persuade The rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made. Twelve days the \
term allow'd: and, during those, Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes, \
Mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare To fell the timber, and forget \
the war. Loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound; Oak, mountain ash, and \
poplar spread the ground; First fall from high; and some the trunks receive \
In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave. And now the fatal news by Fame \
is blown Thro' the short circuit of th' Arcadian town, Of Pallas slain- by \
Fame, which just before His triumphs on distended pinions bore. Rushing from \
out the gate, the people stand, Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand. \
Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze: The fields are lighten'd with a \
fiery blaze, That cast a sullen splendor on their friends, The marching troop \
which their dead prince attends. Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry; \
The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply, And their mix'd mourning rends \
the vaulted sky. The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears, Till the loud \
clamors reach Evander's ears: Forgetful of his state, he runs along, With a \
disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng; Falls on the corpse; and groaning \
there he lies, With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes. Short sighs \
and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks A passage, and at once he weeps and \
speaks: \"O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word, To fight with \
caution, not to tempt the sword! I warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew \
What perils youthful ardor would pursue, That boiling blood would carry thee \
too far, Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war! O curst essay of arms, \
disastrous doom, Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come! Hard elements \
of unauspicious war, Vain vows to Heav'n, and unavailing care! Thrice happy \
thou, dear partner of my bed, Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled, \
Praescious of ills, and leaving me behind, To drink the dregs of life by fate \
assign'd! Beyond the goal of nature I have gone: My Pallas late set out, but \
reach'd too soon. If, for my league against th' Ausonian state, Amidst their \
weapons I had found my fate, (Deserv'd from them,) then I had been return'd A \
breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd. Yet will I not my Trojan friend \
upbraid, Nor grudge th' alliance I so gladly made. 'T was not his fault, my \
Pallas fell so young, But my own crime, for having liv'd too long. Yet, since \
the gods had destin'd him to die, At least he led the way to victory: First \
for his friends he won the fatal shore, And sent whole herds of slaughter'd \
foes before; A death too great, too glorious to deplore. Nor will I add new \
honors to thy grave, Content with those the Trojan hero gave: That funeral \
pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd, In which the Tuscan chiefs and army \
join'd. Great spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they bear: Then let thy \
own achievements be thy share. Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, \
Whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood, If Pallas had arriv'd, with \
equal length Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. But why, \
unhappy man, dost thou detain These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st \
in vain? Go, friends, this message to your lord relate: Tell him, that, if I \
bear my bitter fate, And, after Pallas' death, live ling'ring on, 'T is to \
behold his vengeance for my son. I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head Is \
owing to the living and the dead. My son and I expect it from his hand; 'T is \
all that he can give, or we demand. Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, To \
greet my Pallas with such news below.\" The morn had now dispell'd the shades \
of night, Restoring toils, when she restor'd the light. The Trojan king and \
Tuscan chief command To raise the piles along the winding strand. Their \
friends convey the dead fun'ral fires; Black smold'ring smoke from the green \
wood expires; The light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires. Then \
thrice around the kindled piles they go (For ancient custom had ordain'd it \
so) Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led; And thrice, with loud \
laments, they hail the dead. Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the \
ground, And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. Amid the blaze, \
their pious brethren throw The spoils, in battle taken from the foe: Helms, \
bits emboss'd, and swords of shining steel; One casts a target, one a chariot \
wheel; Some to their fellows their own arms restore: The fauchions which in \
luckless fight they bore, Their bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in \
vain, And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain. Whole herds of offer'd \
bulls, about the fire, And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire. Around \
the piles a careful troop attends, To watch the wasting flames, and weep \
their burning friends; Ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night New decks \
the face of heav'n with starry light. The conquer'd Latians, with like pious \
care, Piles without number for their dead prepare. Part in the places where \
they fell are laid; And part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd. The \
corps of kings, and captains of renown, Borne off in state, are buried in the \
town; The rest, unhonor'd, and without a name, Are cast a common heap to feed \
the flame. Trojans and Latians vie with like desires To make the field of \
battle shine with fires, And the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires. Now had \
the morning thrice renew'd the light, And thrice dispell'd the shadows of the \
night, When those who round the wasted fires remain, Perform the last sad \
office to the slain. They rake the yet warm ashes from below; These, and the \
bones unburn'd, in earth bestow; These relics with their country rites they \
grace, And raise a mount of turf to mark the place. But, in the palace of the \
king, appears A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears. Maids, matrons, \
widows, mix their common moans; Orphans their sires, and sires lament their \
sons. All in that universal sorrow share, And curse the cause of this unhappy \
war: A broken league, a bride unjustly sought, A crown usurp'd, which with \
their blood is bought! These are the crimes with which they load the name Of \
Turnus, and on him alone exclaim: \"Let him who lords it o'er th' Ausonian \
land Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand: His is the gain; our lot is but to \
serve; 'T is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve.\" This Drances \
aggravates; and adds, with spite: \"His foe expects, and dares him to the \
fight.\" Nor Turnus wants a party, to support His cause and credit in the \
Latian court. His former acts secure his present fame, And the queen shades \
him with her mighty name. While thus their factious minds with fury burn, The \
legates from th' Aetolian prince return: Sad news they bring, that, after all \
the cost And care employ'd, their embassy is lost; That Diomedes refus'd his \
aid in war, Unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r. Some new alliance \
must elsewhere be sought, Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought. \
Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late, A foreign son is pointed out by \
fate; And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed, The wrath of Heav'n is hov'ring \
o'er his head. The gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side, When late their \
titles in the field were tried: Witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears \
undried. Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all The Latian senate to \
the council hall. The princes come, commanded by their head, And crowd the \
paths that to the palace lead. Supreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his \
years, He takes the throne, and in the midst appears. Majestically sad, he \
sits in state, And bids his envoys their success relate. When Venulus began, \
the murmuring sound Was hush'd, and sacred silence reign'd around. \"We have,\
\" said he, \"perform'd your high command, And pass'd with peril a long tract \
of land: We reach'd the place desir'd; with wonder fill'd, The Grecian tents \
and rising tow'rs beheld. Great Diomede has compass'd round with walls The \
city, which Argyripa he calls, From his own Argos nam'd. We touch'd, with \
joy, The royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy. When introduc'd, our presents \
first we bring, Then crave an instant audience from the king. His leave \
obtain'd, our native soil we name, And tell th' important cause for which we \
came. Attentively he heard us, while we spoke; Then, with soft accents, and a \
pleasing look, Made this return: 'Ausonian race, of old Renown'd for peace, \
and for an age of gold, What madness has your alter'd minds possess'd, To \
change for war hereditary rest, Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword, A \
needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd? We- for myself I speak, and all the \
name Of Grecians, who to Troy's destruction came, Omitting those who were in \
battle slain, Or borne by rolling Simois to the main- Not one but suffer'd, \
and too dearly bought The prize of honor which in arms he sought; Some doom'd \
to death, and some in exile driv'n. Outcasts, abandon'd by the care of \
Heav'n; So worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew, As ev'n old Priam might \
with pity view. Witness the vessels by Minerva toss'd In storms; the vengeful \
Capharean coast; Th' Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led Our armies \
to revenge his injur'd bed, In Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men Have seen \
Charybdis and the Cyclops' den. Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain Restor'd \
to scepters, and expell'd again? Or young Achilles, by his rival slain? Ev'n \
he, the King of Men, the foremost name Of all the Greeks, and most renown'd \
by fame, The proud revenger of another's wife, Yet by his own adult'ress lost \
his life; Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy The foul polluters of \
his bed enjoy. The gods have envied me the sweets of life, My much lov'd \
country, and my more lov'd wife: Banish'd from both, I mourn; while in the \
sky, Transform'd to birds, my lost companions fly: Hov'ring about the coasts, \
they make their moan, And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own. What \
squalid specters, in the dead of night, Break my short sleep, and skim before \
my sight! I might have promis'd to myself those harms, Mad as I was, when I, \
with mortal arms, Presum'd against immortal pow'rs to move, And violate with \
wounds the Queen of Love. Such arms this hand shall never more employ; No \
hate remains with me to ruin'd Troy. I war not with its dust; nor am I glad \
To think of past events, or good or bad. Your presents I return: whate'er you \
bring To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king. We met in fight; I know \
him, to my cost: With what a whirling force his lance he toss'd! Heav'ns! \
what a spring was in his arm, to throw! How high he held his shield, and rose \
at ev'ry blow! Had Troy produc'd two more his match in might, They would have \
chang'd the fortune of the fight: Th' invasion of the Greeks had been \
return'd, Our empire wasted, and our cities burn'd. The long defense the \
Trojan people made, The war protracted, and the siege delay'd, Were due to \
Hector's and this hero's hand: Both brave alike, and equal in command; \
Aeneas, not inferior in the field, In pious reverence to the gods excell'd. \
Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care Th' impending dangers of a fatal \
war.' He said no more; but, with this cold excuse, Refus'd th' alliance, and \
advis'd a truce.\" Thus Venulus concluded his report. A jarring murmur fill'd \
the factious court: As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force, And dashes \
o'er the stones that stop the course, The flood, constrain'd within a scanty \
space, Roars horrible along th' uneasy race; White foam in gath'ring eddies \
floats around; The rocky shores rebellow to the sound. The murmur ceas'd: \
then from his lofty throne The king invok'd the gods, and thus begun: \"I \
wish, ye Latins, what we now debate Had been resolv'd before it was too late. \
Much better had it been for you and me, Unforc'd by this our last necessity, \
To have been earlier wise, than now to call A council, when the foe surrounds \
the wall. O citizens, we wage unequal war, With men not only Heav'n's \
peculiar care, But Heav'n's own race; unconquer'd in the field, Or, \
conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield. What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay \
down: Our hopes must center on ourselves alone. Yet those how feeble, and, \
indeed, how vain, You see too well; nor need my words explain. Vanquish'd \
without resource; laid flat by fate; Factions within, a foe without the gate! \
Not but I grant that all perform'd their parts With manly force, and with \
undaunted hearts: With our united strength the war we wag'd; With equal \
numbers, equal arms, engag'd. You see th' event.- Now hear what I propose, To \
save our friends, and satisfy our foes. A tract of land the Latins have \
possess'd Along the Tiber, stretching to the west, Which now Rutulians and \
Auruncans till, And their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill. Those \
mountains fill'd with firs, that lower land, If you consent, the Trojan shall \
command, Call'd into part of what is ours; and there, On terms agreed, the \
common country share. There let'em build and settle, if they please; Unless \
they choose once more to cross the seas, In search of seats remote from \
Italy, And from unwelcome inmates set us free. Then twice ten galleys let us \
build with speed, Or twice as many more, if more they need. Materials are at \
hand; a well-grown wood Runs equal with the margin of the flood: Let them the \
number and the form assign; The care and cost of all the stores be mine. To \
treat the peace, a hundred senators Shall be commission'd hence with ample \
pow'rs, With olive the presents they shall bear, A purple robe, a royal iv'ry \
chair, And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear, And sums of gold. \
Among yourselves debate This great affair, and save the sinking state.\" Then \
Drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since, The rising glories of the \
Daunian prince. Factious and rich, bold at the council board, But cautious in \
the field, he shunn'd the sword; A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord. \
Noble his mother was, and near the throne; But, what his father's parentage, \
unknown. He rose, and took th' advantage of the times, To load young Turnus \
with invidious crimes. \"Such truths, O king,\" said he, \"your words \
contain, As strike the sense, and all replies are vain; Nor are your loyal \
subjects now to seek What common needs require, but fear to speak. Let him \
give leave of speech, that haughty man, Whose pride this unauspicious war \
began; For whose ambition (let me dare to say, Fear set apart, tho' death is \
in my way) The plains of Latium run with blood around. So many valiant heroes \
bite the ground; Dejected grief in ev'ry face appears; A town in mourning, \
and a land in tears; While he, th' undoubted author of our harms, The man who \
menaces the gods with arms, Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight, And \
sought his safety in ignoble flight. Now, best of kings, since you propose to \
send Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend; Add yet a greater at our \
joint request, One which he values more than all the rest: Give him the fair \
Lavinia for his bride; With that alliance let the league be tied, And for the \
bleeding land a lasting peace provide. Let insolence no longer awe the \
throne; But, with a father's right, bestow your own. For this maligner of the \
general good, If still we fear his force, he must be woo'd; His haughty \
godhead we with pray'rs implore, Your scepter to release, and our just rights \
restore. O cursed cause of all our ills, must we Wage wars unjust, and fall \
in fight, for thee! What right hast thou to rule the Latian state, And send \
us out to meet our certain fate? 'T is a destructive war: from Turnus' hand \
Our peace and public safety we demand. Let the fair bride to the brave chief \
remain; If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain. Turnus, I know you \
think me not your friend, Nor will I much with your belief contend: I beg \
your greatness not to give the law In others' realms, but, beaten, to \
withdraw. Pity your own, or pity our estate; Nor twist our fortunes with your \
sinking fate. Your interest is, the war should never cease; But we have felt \
enough to wish the peace: A land exhausted to the last remains, Depopulated \
towns, and driven plains. Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow'r, A \
beauteous princess, with a crown in dow'r, So fire your mind, in arms assert \
your right, And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight. Mankind, it seems, \
is made for you alone; We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne: A base \
ignoble crowd, without a name, Unwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame, By \
duty bound to forfeit each his life, That Turnus may possess a royal wife. \
Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew Should share such triumphs, and detain \
from you The post of honor, your undoubted due. Rather alone your matchless \
force employ, To merit what alone you must enjoy.\" These words, so full of \
malice mix'd with art, Inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart. Then, \
groaning from the bottom of his breast, He heav'd for wind, and thus his \
wrath express'd: \"You, Drances, never want a stream of words, Then, when the \
public need requires our swords. First in the council hall to steer the \
state, And ever foremost in a tongue-debate, While our strong walls secure us \
from the foe, Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow: But let the potent \
orator declaim, And with the brand of coward blot my name; Free leave is \
giv'n him, when his fatal hand Has cover'd with more corps the sanguine \
strand, And high as mine his tow'ring trophies stand. If any doubt remains, \
who dares the most, Let us decide it at the Trojan's cost, And issue both \
abreast, where honor calls- Foes are not far to seek without the walls- \
Unless his noisy tongue can only fight, And feet were giv'n him but to speed \
his flight. I beaten from the field? I forc'd away? Who, but so known a \
dastard, dares to say? Had he but ev'n beheld the fight, his eyes Had \
witness'd for me what his tongue denies: What heaps of Trojans by this hand \
were slain, And how the bloody Tiber swell'd the main. All saw, but he, th' \
Arcadian troops retire In scatter'd squadrons, and their prince expire. The \
giant brothers, in their camp, have found, I was not forc'd with ease to quit \
my ground. Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos'd, I singly their \
united arms oppos'd: First forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array; Then, \
glutted with their slaughter, freed my way. 'T is a destructive war? So let \
it be, But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee! Meantime proceed to fill the \
people's ears With false reports, their minds with panic fears: Extol the \
strength of a twice-conquer'd race; Our foes encourage, and our friends \
debase. Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town Triumphant stands; the \
Grecians are o'erthrown; Suppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies, And \
Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies. Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread Runs \
backward from the sea, and hides his head, When the great Trojan on his bank \
appears; For that's as true as thy dissembled fears Of my revenge. Dismiss \
that vanity: Thou, Drances, art below a death from me. Let that vile soul in \
that vile body rest; The lodging is well worthy of the guest. \"Now, royal \
father, to the present state Of our affairs, and of this high debate: If in \
your arms thus early you diffide, And think your fortune is already tried; If \
one defeat has brought us down so low, As never more in fields to meet the \
foe; Then I conclude for peace: 't is time to treat, And lie like vassals at \
the victor's feet. But, O! if any ancient blood remains, One drop of all our \
fathers', in our veins, That man would I prefer before the rest, Who dar'd \
his death with an undaunted breast; Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound, \
To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw'd the ground. But, if we still have \
fresh recruits in store, If our confederates can afford us more; If the \
contended field we bravely fought, And not a bloodless victory was bought; \
Their losses equal'd ours; and, for their slain, With equal fires they fill'd \
the shining plain; Why thus, unforc'd, should we so tamely yield, And, ere \
the trumpet sounds, resign the field? Good unexpected, evils unforeseen, \
Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene: Some, rais'd aloft, come \
tumbling down amain; Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again. If Diomede \
refuse his aid to lend, The great Messapus yet remains our friend: Tolumnius, \
who foretells events, is ours; Th' Italian chiefs and princes join their \
pow'rs: Nor least in number, nor in name the last, Your own brave subjects \
have your cause embrac'd Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon Contains an army \
in herself alone, And heads a squadron, terrible to sight, With glitt'ring \
shields, in brazen armor bright. Yet, if the foe a single fight demand, And I \
alone the public peace withstand; If you consent, he shall not be refus'd, \
Nor find a hand to victory unus'd. This new Achilles, let him take the field, \
With fated armor, and Vulcanian shield! For you, my royal father, and my \
fame, I, Turnus, not the least of all my name, Devote my soul. He calls me \
hand to hand, And I alone will answer his demand. Drances shall rest secure, \
and neither share The danger, nor divide the prize of war.\" While they \
debate, nor these nor those will yield, Aeneas draws his forces to the field, \
And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed Return, and thro' the \
frighted city spread Th' unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried, In battle \
marching by the river side, And bending to the town. They take th' alarm: \
Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm. Th' impetuous youth press \
forward to the field; They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield: The \
fearful matrons raise a screaming cry; Old feeble men with fainter groans \
reply; A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky, Like that of swans \
remurm'ring to the floods, Or birds of diff'ring kinds in hollow woods. \
Turnus th' occasion takes, and cries aloud: \"Talk on, ye quaint haranguers \
of the crowd: Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls, And the fierce \
foes in arms approach the walls.\" He said, and, turning short, with speedy \
pace, Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place: \"Thou, Volusus, the \
Volscian troops command To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band. Messapus \
and Catillus, post your force Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse. \
Some guard the passes, others man the wall; Drawn up in arms, the rest attend \
my call.\" They swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town, And with disorder'd \
haste the rampires crown. Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late, The \
gath'ring storm just breaking on the state, Dismiss'd the council till a \
fitter time, And own'd his easy temper as his crime, Who, forc'd against his \
reason, had complied To break the treaty for the promis'd bride. Some help to \
sink new trenches; others aid To ram the stones, or raise the palisade. \
Hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls Runs a distracted crew, \
whom their last labor calls. A sad procession in the streets is seen, Of \
matrons, that attend the mother queen: High in her chair she sits, and, at \
her side, With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride. They mount the cliff, \
where Pallas' temple stands; Pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their \
hands, With censers first they fume the sacred shrine, Then in this common \
supplication join: \"O patroness of arms, unspotted maid, Propitious hear, \
and lend thy Latins aid! Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate, \
And lay the Phrygian low before the gate.\" Now Turnus arms for fight. His \
back and breast Well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest: The cuishes which \
his brawny thighs infold Are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold. His \
faithful fauchion sits upon his side; Nor casque, nor crest, his manly \
features hide: But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends, With godlike \
grace, he from the tow'r descends. Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare \
His absent rival, and to promise war. Freed from his keepers, thus, with \
broken reins, The wanton courser prances o'er the plains, Or in the pride of \
youth o'erleaps the mounds, And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds. Or \
seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood, To quench his thirst, and cool \
his fiery blood: He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain, And o'er his \
shoulder flows his waving mane: He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on \
high; Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly. Soon as the prince \
appears without the gate, The Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait His \
last commands. Then, with a graceful mien, Lights from her lofty steed the \
warrior queen: Her squadron imitates, and each descends; Whose common suit \
Camilla thus commends: \"If sense of honor, if a soul secure Of inborn worth, \
that can all tests endure, Can promise aught, or on itself rely Greatly to \
dare, to conquer or to die; Then, I alone, sustain'd by these, will meet The \
Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat. Ours be the danger, ours the sole \
renown: You, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town:\" Turnus a while stood \
mute, with glad surprise, And on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes; Then thus \
return'd: \"O grace of Italy, With what becoming thanks can I reply? Not only \
words lie lab'ring in my breast, But thought itself is by thy praise \
oppress'd. Yet rob me not of all; but let me join My toils, my hazard, and my \
fame, with thine. The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd, Sends his light \
horse before to scour the field: Himself, thro' steep ascents and thorny \
brakes, A larger compass to the city takes. This news my scouts confirm, and \
I prepare To foil his cunning, and his force to dare; With chosen foot his \
passage to forelay, And place an ambush in the winding way. Thou, with thy \
Volscians, face the Tuscan horse; The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce \
With those of Tibur, and the Latian band, Subjected all to thy supreme \
command.\" This said, he warns Messapus to the war, Then ev'ry chief exhorts \
with equal care. All thus encourag'd, his own troops he joins, And hastes to \
prosecute his deep designs. Inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies, By \
nature form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise. A narrow track, by human \
steps untrode, Leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode. High \
o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands, Whence the surveying sight the nether \
ground commands. The top is level, an offensive seat Of war; and from the war \
a safe retreat: For, on the right and left, is room to press The foes at \
hand, or from afar distress; To drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour On \
their descending backs a stony show'r. Thither young Turnus took the \
well-known way, Possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay. Meantime \
Latonian Phoebe, from the skies, Beheld th' approaching war with hateful \
eyes, And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid, Her most belov'd and \
ever-trusty maid; Then with a sigh began: \"Camilla goes To meet her death \
amidst her fatal foes: The nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train, Invested \
with Diana's arms, in vain. Nor is my kindness for the virgin new: 'T was \
born with her; and with her years it grew. Her father Metabus, when forc'd \
away From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway, Snatch'd up, and sav'd from his \
prevailing foes, This tender babe, companion of his woes. Casmilla was her \
mother; but he drown'd One hissing letter in a softer sound, And call'd \
Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies; Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies. \
His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace; With shout and clamors they \
pursue the chase. The banks of Amasene at length he gains: The raging flood \
his farther flight restrains, Rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains. \
Prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears, Not for himself, but for the \
charge he bears. Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste; Then, \
desp'rate in distress, resolves at last. A knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he \
bore; The middle part with cork he cover'd o'er: He clos'd the child within \
the hollow space; With twigs of bending osier bound the case; Then pois'd the \
spear, heavy with human weight, And thus invok'd my favor for the freight: \
'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said, 'Sent by her sire, this \
dedicated maid! Thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine; And the first \
weapons that she knows, are thine.' He said; and with full force the spear he \
threw: Above the sounding waves Camilla flew. Then, press'd by foes, he \
stemm'd the stormy tide, And gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side. His \
fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground, And, victor of his vows, his \
infant nymph unbound; Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose, Would \
trust his hunted life amidst his foes; But, rough, in open air he chose to \
lie; Earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky. On hills unshorn, or in a \
desart den, He shunn'd the dire society of men. A shepherd's solitary life he \
led; His daughter with the milk of mares he fed. The dugs of bears, and ev'ry \
salvage beast, He drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd. The little \
Amazon could scarcely go: He loads her with a quiver and a bow; And, that she \
might her stagg'ring steps command, He with a slender jav'lin fills her hand. \
Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound; Nor swept her trailing robe the \
dusty ground. Instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread Her back and \
shoulders, fasten'd to her head. The flying dart she first attempts to fling, \
And round her tender temples toss'd the sling; Then, as her strength with \
years increas'd, began To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan, And from the \
clouds to fetch the heron and the crane. The Tuscan matrons with each other \
vied, To bless their rival sons with such a bride; But she disdains their \
love, to share with me The sylvan shades and vow'd virginity. And, O! I wish, \
contented with my cares Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars! Then \
had she been of my celestial train, And shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be \
slain. But since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes To find her death among \
forbidden foes, Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight. Where, \
with the gods, averse, the Latins fight. This bow to thee, this quiver I \
bequeath, This chosen arrow, to revenge her death: By whate'er hand Camilla \
shall be slain, Or of the Trojan or Italian train, Let him not pass \
unpunish'd from the plain. Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid To bear \
the breathless body of my maid: Unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd \
Her holy limbs with any human hand, And in a marble tomb laid in her native \
land.\" She said. The faithful nymph descends from high With rapid flight, \
and cuts the sounding sky: Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly. \
By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse, Drawn up in squadrons, with united \
force, Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound, Press forward on \
their bits, and shift their ground. Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly \
from far; And the fields glitter with a waving war. Oppos'd to these, come on \
with furious force Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse; These in the body \
plac'd, on either hand Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band. Advancing \
in a line, they couch their spears; And less and less the middle space \
appears. Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen The neighing \
coursers, and the shouting men. In distance of their darts they stop their \
course; Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse. The face of heav'n \
their flying jav'lins hide, And deaths unseen are dealt on either side. \
Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear, By mettled coursers borne in full \
career, Meet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock, Their horses' heads \
against each other knock. Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast, As with \
an engine's force, or lightning's blast: He rolls along in blood, and \
breathes his last. The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright, And sling their \
shields behind, to save their backs in flight Spurring at speed to their own \
walls they drew; Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue, And urge their \
flight: Asylas leads the chase; Till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about \
and face, Receive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry. The Tuscans take \
their turn to fear and fly. So swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar, \
Driv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore, Bound o'er the rocks, \
incroach upon the land, And far upon the beach eject the sand; Then backward, \
with a swing, they take their way, Repuls'd from upper ground, and seek their \
mother sea; With equal hurry quit th' invaded shore, And swallow back the \
sand and stones they spew'd before. Twice were the Tuscans masters of the \
field, Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell'd. Asham'd at length, to \
the third charge they ran; Both hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man. Now \
dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd With falling bodies, and are \
drunk with blood. Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie: Confus'd the \
fight, and more confus'd the cry. Orsilochus, who durst not press too near \
Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear, And stuck the steel beneath his \
horse's ear. The fiery steed, impatient of the wound, Curvets, and, springing \
upward with a bound, His helpless lord cast backward on the ground. Catillus \
pierc'd Iolas first; then drew His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw, The \
mighty champion of the Tuscan crew. His neck and throat unarm'd, his head was \
bare, But shaded with a length of yellow hair: Secure, he fought, expos'd on \
ev'ry part, A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart. Across the \
shoulders came the feather'd wound; Transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the \
ground. The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed, And death with \
honor sought on either side. Resistless thro' the war Camilla rode, In danger \
unappall'd, and pleas'd with blood. One side was bare for her exerted breast; \
One shoulder with her painted quiver press'd. Now from afar her fatal \
jav'lins play; Now with her ax's edge she hews her way: Diana's arms upon her \
shoulder sound; And when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground, From her \
bent bow she sends a backward wound. Her maids, in martial pomp, on either \
side, Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride: Italians all; in peace, their \
queen's delight; In war, the bold companions of the fight. So march'd the \
Tracian Amazons of old, When Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd: Such \
troops as these in shining arms were seen, When Theseus met in fight their \
maiden queen: Such to the field Penthisilea led, From the fierce virgin when \
the Grecians fled; With such, return'd triumphant from the war, Her maids \
with cries attend the lofty car; They clash with manly force their moony \
shields; With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields. Who foremost, and \
who last, heroic maid, On the cold earth were by thy courage laid? Thy spear, \
of mountain ash, Eumenius first, With fury driv'n, from side to side \
transpierc'd: A purple stream came spouting from the wound; Bath'd in his \
blood he lies, and bites the ground. Liris and Pegasus at once she slew: The \
former, as the slacken'd reins he drew Of his faint steed; the latter, as he \
stretch'd His arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd. By the same \
weapon, sent from the same hand, Both fall together, and both spurn the sand. \
Amastrus next is added to the slain: The rest in rout she follows o'er the \
plain: Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon, And Chromis, at full speed her fury \
shun. Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost; Each was attended with a \
Trojan ghost. Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed, Swift for the chase, \
and of Apulian breed. Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown: O'er his \
broad back an ox's hide was thrown; His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were \
spread A cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his head, He clench'd \
within his hand an iron prong, And tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the \
throng. Him soon she singled from the flying train, And slew with ease; then \
thus insults the slain: \"Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase \
The savage herd, a vile and trembling race? Here cease thy vaunts, and own my \
victory: A woman warrior was too strong for thee. Yet, if the ghosts demand \
the conqu'ror's name, Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame.\" Then Butes \
and Orsilochus she slew, The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew; But Butes \
breast to breast: the spear descends Above the gorget, where his helmet ends, \
And o'er the shield which his left side defends. Orsilochus and she their \
courses ply: He seems to follow, and she seems to fly; But in a narrower ring \
she makes the race; And then he flies, and she pursues the chase. Gath'ring \
at length on her deluded foe, She swings her ax, and rises to the blow Full \
on the helm behind, with such a sway The weapon falls, the riven steel gives \
way: He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace; Brains, mingled with his \
blood, besmear his face. Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance, To see his \
fall; nor farther dares advance; But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye, He \
stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly; Yet, like a true Ligurian, born \
to cheat, (At least while fortune favor'd his deceit,) Cries out aloud: \
\"What courage have you shown, Who trust your courser's strength, and not \
your own? Forego the vantage of your horse, alight, And then on equal terms \
begin the fight: It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can, When, foot to \
foot, you combat with a man,\" He said. She glows with anger and disdain, \
Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain, And leaves her horse at large \
among her train; With her drawn sword defies him to the field, And, marching, \
lifts aloft her maiden shield. The youth, who thought his cunning did \
succeed, Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed; Adds the remembrance \
of the spur, and hides The goring rowels in his bleeding sides. \"Vain fool, \
and coward!\" cries the lofty maid, \"Caught in the train which thou thyself \
hast laid! On others practice thy Ligurian arts; Thin stratagems and tricks \
of little hearts Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire, With vaunting \
lies, to thy fallacious sire.\" At this, so fast her flying feet she sped, \
That soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head: Then turning short, at once \
she seiz'd the rein, And laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain. Not with \
more ease the falcon, from above, Trusses in middle air the trembling dove, \
Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound: The feathers, foul with \
blood, come tumbling to the ground. Now mighty Jove, from his superior \
height, With his broad eye surveys th' unequal fight. He fires the breast of \
Tarchon with disdain, And sends him to redeem th' abandon'd plain. Betwixt \
the broken ranks the Tuscan rides, And these encourages, and those he chides; \
Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight; Renews their ardor, and \
restores the fight. \"What panic fear has seiz'd your souls? O shame, O brand \
perpetual of th' Etrurian name! Cowards incurable, a woman's hand Drives, \
breaks, and scatters your ignoble band! Now cast away the sword, and quit the \
shield! What use of weapons which you dare not wield? Not thus you fly your \
female foes by night, Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite; When to \
fat off'rings the glad augur calls, And the shrill hornpipe sounds to \
bacchanals. These are your studied cares, your lewd delight: Swift to \
debauch, but slow to manly fight.\" Thus having said, he spurs amid the foes, \
Not managing the life he meant to lose. The first he found he seiz'd with \
headlong haste, In his strong gripe, and clasp'd around the waist; 'T was \
Venulus, whom from his horse he tore, And, laid athwart his own, in triumph \
bore. Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes, And view th' unusual \
sight with vast surprise. The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains, Press'd \
in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains; Then, with his shorten'd spear, \
explores around His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound. Nor less the captive \
struggles for his life: He writhes his body to prolong the strife, And, \
fencing for his naked throat, exerts His utmost vigor, and the point averts. \
So stoops the yellow eagle from on high, And bears a speckled serpent thro' \
the sky, Fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey: The pris'ner hisses thro' \
the liquid way; Resists the royal hawk; and, tho' oppress'd, She fights in \
volumes, and erects her crest: Turn'd to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale, \
And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat'ning tail. Against the \
victor, all defense is weak: Th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak; \
He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores; Then claps his pinions, and \
securely soars. Thus, thro' the midst of circling enemies, Strong Tarchon \
snatch'd and bore away his prize. The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, \
now press The Latins, and presume the like success. Then Aruns, doom'd to \
death, his arts assay'd, To murther, unespied, the Volscian maid: This way \
and that his winding course he bends, And, whereso'er she turns, her steps \
attends. When she retires victorious from the chase, He wheels about with \
care, and shifts his place; When, rushing on, she seeks her foes flight, He \
keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight: He threats, and trembles, trying \
ev'ry way, Unseen to kill, and safely to betray. Chloreus, the priest of \
Cybele, from far, Glitt'ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war, Was by the \
virgin view'd. The steed he press'd Was proud with trappings, and his brawny \
chest With scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er; A robe of Tyrian dye the \
rider wore. With deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe; Gnossian his \
shafts, and Lycian was his bow: A golden helm his front and head surrounds A \
gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds. Gold, weav'd with linen, on his \
thighs he wore, With flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er, With golden \
buckles bound, and gather'd up before. Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent \
eyes, Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize, Or that the temple might his \
trophies hold, Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold. Blind in her haste, \
she chases him alone. And seeks his life, regardless of her own. This lucky \
moment the sly traitor chose: Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose, And \
threw, but first to Heav'n address'd his vows: \"O patron of Socrates' high \
abodes, Phoebus, the ruling pow'r among the gods, Whom first we serve, whole \
woods of unctuous pine Are fell'd for thee, and to thy glory shine; By thee \
protected with our naked soles, Thro' flames unsing'd we march, and tread the \
kindled coals Give me, propitious pow'r, to wash away The stains of this \
dishonorable day: Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim, But with my \
future actions trust my fame. Let me, by stealth, this female plague \
o'ercome, And from the field return inglorious home.\" Apollo heard, and, \
granting half his pray'r, Shuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty \
air. He gives the death desir'd; his safe return By southern tempests to the \
seas is borne. Now, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies, Both armies on \
Camilla turn'd their eyes, Directed by the sound. Of either host, Th' unhappy \
virgin, tho' concern'd the most, Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent On \
golden spoils, and on her prey intent; Till in her pap the winged weapon \
stood Infix'd, and deeply drunk the purple blood. Her sad attendants hasten \
to sustain Their dying lady, drooping on the plain. Far from their sight the \
trembling Aruns flies, With beating heart, and fear confus'd with joys; Nor \
dares he farther to pursue his blow, Or ev'n to bear the sight of his \
expiring foe. As, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide At unawares, or \
ranch'd a shepherd's side, Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies, And \
claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs: So, speeding once, the wretch no \
more attends, But, spurring forward, herds among his friends. She wrench'd \
the jav'lin with her dying hands, But wedg'd within her breast the weapon \
stands; The wood she draws, the steely point remains; She staggers in her \
seat with agonizing pains: (A gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes, \
And from her cheeks the rosy color flies:) Then turns to her, whom of her \
female train She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain: \"Acca, 't is \
past! he swims before my sight, Inexorable Death; and claims his right. Bear \
my last words to Turnus; fly with speed, And bid him timely to my charge \
succeed, Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve: Farewell! and in this kiss \
my parting breath receive.\" She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain: \
Dying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein; Short, and more short, she pants; \
by slow degrees Her mind the passage from her body frees. She drops her \
sword; she nods her plumy crest, Her drooping head declining on her breast: \
In the last sigh her struggling soul expires, And, murm'ring with disdain, to \
Stygian sounds retires. A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued; \
Despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd. The Trojan troops and Tuscans, \
in a line, Advance to charge; the mix'd Arcadians join. But Cynthia's maid, \
high seated, from afar Surveys the field, and fortune of the war, Unmov'd a \
while, till, prostrate on the plain, Welt'ring in blood, she sees Camilla \
slain, And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train. Then, \
from the bottom of her breast, she drew A mournful sigh, and these sad words \
ensue: \"Too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid, For warring with the \
Trojans, thou hast paid! Nor aught avail'd, in this unhappy strife, Diana's \
sacred arms, to save thy life. Yet unreveng'd thy goddess will not leave Her \
vot'ry's death, nor; with vain sorrow grieve. Branded the wretch, and be his \
name abhorr'd; But after ages shall thy praise record. Th' inglorious coward \
soon shall press the plain: Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain.\" \
High o'er the field there stood a hilly mound, Sacred the place, and spread \
with oaks around, Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay, A king that once in \
Latium bore the sway. The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight, To mark the \
traitor Aruns from the height. Him in refulgent arms she soon espied, Swoln \
with success; and loudly thus she cried: \"Thy backward steps, vain boaster, \
are too late; Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate. Charg'd with my \
message, to Camilla go, And say I sent thee to the shades below, An honor \
undeserv'd from Cynthia's bow.\" She said, and from her quiver chose with \
speed The winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed; Then to the stubborn yew \
her strength applied, Till the far distant horns approach'd on either side. \
The bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she drew; Whizzing in air the \
fatal arrow flew. At once the twanging bow and sounding dart The traitor \
heard, and felt the point within his heart. Him, beating with his heels in \
pangs of death, His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath. The conqu'ring \
damsel, with expanded wings, The welcome message to her mistress brings. \
Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field, And, unsustain'd, the chiefs \
of Turnus yield. The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly, More on \
their speed than on their strength rely. Confus'd in flight, they bear each \
other down, And spur their horses headlong to the town. Driv'n by their foes, \
and to their fears resign'd, Not once they turn, but take their wounds \
behind. These drop the shield, and those the lance forego, Or on their \
shoulders bear the slacken'd bow. The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound, \
Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground. Black clouds of dust come \
rolling in the sky, And o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly. The \
trembling matrons, from their lofty stands, Rend heav'n with female shrieks, \
and wring their hands. All pressing on, pursuers and pursued, Are crush'd in \
crowds, a mingled multitude. Some happy few escape: the throng too late Rush \
on for entrance, till they choke the gate. Ev'n in the sight of home, the \
wretched sire Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire. Then, in a fright, \
the folding gates they close, But leave their friends excluded with their \
foes. The vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout; 'T is terror all within, \
and slaughter all without. Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall, \
Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall. The Latian virgins, valiant \
with despair, Arm'd on the tow'rs, the common danger share: So much of zeal \
their country's cause inspir'd; So much Camilla's great example fir'd. Poles, \
sharpen'd in the flames, from high they throw, With imitated darts, to gall \
the foe. Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath, And crowd each other \
to be first in death. Meantime to Turnus, ambush'd in the shade, With heavy \
tidings came th' unhappy maid: \"The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill'd; \
The foes, entirely masters of the field, Like a resistless flood, come \
rolling on: The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town.\" Inflam'd \
with rage, (for so the Furies fire The Daunian's breast, and so the Fates \
require,) He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain Possess'd, and downward \
issues on the plain. Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed From \
secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. Thro' the black forest and the ferny \
brake, Unknowingly secure, their way they take; From the rough mountains to \
the plain descend, And there, in order drawn, their line extend. Both armies \
now in open fields are seen; Nor far the distance of the space between. Both \
to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro' smoking fields, his hast'ning enemies; \
And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th' approaching horses \
proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd; But westward to \
the sea the sun declin'd. Intrench'd before the town both armies lie, While \
Night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII When Turnus saw the Latins \
leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell'd, Himself \
become the mark of public spite, His honor question'd for the promis'd fight; \
The more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd, The more his fury boil'd within \
his breast: He rous'd his vigor for the last debate, And rais'd his haughty \
soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a \
sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his \
side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, \
he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; \
his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. \
Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach'd the king, \
and thus began: \"No more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar'd to \
combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land. The Trojan, by \
his word, is bound to take The same conditions which himself did make. Renew \
the truce; the solemn rites prepare, And to my single virtue trust the war. \
The Latians unconcern'd shall see the fight; This arm unaided shall assert \
your right: Then, if my prostrate body press the plain, To him the crown and \
beauteous bride remain.\" To whom the king sedately thus replied: \"Brave \
youth, the more your valor has been tried, The more becomes it us, with due \
respect, To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect. You want not wealth, \
or a successive throne, Or cities which your arms have made your own: My \
towns and treasures are at your command, And stor'd with blooming beauties is \
my land; Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees, Unmarried, fair, of noble \
families. Now let me speak, and you with patience hear, Things which perhaps \
may grate a lover's ear, But sound advice, proceeding from a heart Sincerely \
yours, and free from fraudful art. The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown, \
No prince Italian born should heir my throne: Oft have our augurs, in \
prediction skill'd, And oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd. Yet, won by \
worth that cannot be withstood, Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood, \
Urg'd by my wife, who would not be denied, I promis'd my Lavinia for your \
bride: Her from her plighted lord by force I took; All ties of treaties, and \
of honor, broke: On your account I wag'd an impious war- With what success, \
't is needless to declare; I and my subjects feel, and you have had your \
share. Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive, Scarce in our walls \
we keep our hopes alive: The rolling flood runs warm with human gore; The \
bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore. Why put I not an end to this \
debate, Still unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate? If Turnus' death a \
lasting peace can give, Why should I not procure it whilst you live? Should I \
to doubtful arms your youth betray, What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say? \
And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!) How curse the cause \
which hasten'd to his end The daughter's lover and the father's friend? Weigh \
in your mind the various chance of war; Pity your parent's age, and ease his \
care.\" Such balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain: The proffer'd med'cine \
but provok'd the pain. The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief, With \
intermitting sobs thus vents his grief: \"The care, O best of fathers, which \
you take For my concerns, at my desire forsake. Permit me not to languish out \
my days, But make the best exchange of life for praise. This arm, this lance, \
can well dispute the prize; And the blood follows, where the weapon flies. \
His goddess mother is not near, to shroud The flying coward with an empty \
cloud.\" But now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life, And loath'd the hard \
conditions of the strife, Held him by force; and, dying in his death, In \
these sad accents gave her sorrow breath: \"O Turnus, I adjure thee by these \
tears, And whate'er price Amata's honor bears Within thy breast, since thou \
art all my hope, My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop; Since on the \
safety of thy life alone Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne: Refuse me \
not this one, this only pray'r, To waive the combat, and pursue the war. \
Whatever chance attends this fatal strife, Think it includes, in thine, \
Amata's life. I cannot live a slave, or see my throne Usurp'd by strangers or \
a Trojan son.\" At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed; A crimson blush her \
beauteous face o'erspread, Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red. \
The driving colors, never at a stay, Run here and there, and flush, and fade \
away. Delightful change! Thus Indian iv'ry shows, Which with the bord'ring \
paint of purple glows; Or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose. The lover \
gaz'd, and, burning with desire, The more he look'd, the more he fed the \
fire: Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite, Roll in his breast, and \
rouse him to the fight. Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes, Firm to his \
first intent, he thus replies: \"O mother, do not by your tears prepare Such \
boding omens, and prejudge the war. Resolv'd on fight, I am no longer free To \
shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree.\" Then turning to the herald, thus \
pursues: \"Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news; Denounce from me, that, \
when to-morrow's light Shall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the fight; \
The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more Shall dye, with mutual blood, the \
Latian shore: Our single swords the quarrel shall decide, And to the victor \
be the beauteous bride.\" He said, and striding on, with speedy pace, He \
sought his coursers of the Thracian race. At his approach they toss their \
heads on high, And, proudly neighing, promise victory. The sires of these \
Orythia sent from far, To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war. The drifts of \
Thracian snows were scarce so white, Nor northern winds in fleetness match'd \
their flight. Officious grooms stand ready by his side; And some with combs \
their flowing manes divide, And others stroke their chests and gently soothe \
their pride He sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass Of golden metal \
those, and mountain brass. Then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied, And \
girt his faithful fauchion to his side. In his Aetnaean forge, the God of \
Fire That fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire; Immortal keenness on the \
blade bestow'd, And plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood. Propp'd on a \
pillar, which the ceiling bore, Was plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore; \
Which with such force he brandish'd in his hand, The tough ash trembled like \
an osier wand: Then cried: \"O pond'rous spoil of Actor slain, And never yet \
by Turnus toss'd in vain, Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go, Sent by \
this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe! Give me to tear his corslet from his \
breast, And from that eunuch head to rend the crest; Dragg'd in the dust, his \
frizzled hair to soil, Hot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant \
oil!\" Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies A fiery steam, and \
sparkles from his eyes. So fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight: \
Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight; He tries his goring horns against \
a tree, And meditates his absent enemy; He pushes at the winds; he digs the \
strand With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand. Nor less the Trojan, \
in his Lemnian arms, To future fight his manly courage warms: He whets his \
fury, and with joy prepares To terminate at once the ling'ring wars; To cheer \
his chiefs and tender son, relates What Heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the \
fates. Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease The rage of arms, and \
ratify the peace. The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height, Had scarcely \
spread the skies with rosy light; Th' ethereal coursers, bounding from the \
sea, From out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day; When now the Trojan \
and Rutulian guard, In friendly labor join'd, the list prepar'd. Beneath the \
walls they measure out the space; Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass, \
Where, with religious their common gods they place. In purest white the \
priests their heads attire; And living waters bear, and holy fire; And, o'er \
their linen hoods and shaded hair, Long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain \
wear, In order issuing from the town appears The Latin legion, arm'd with \
pointed spears; And from the fields, advancing on a line, The Trojan and the \
Tuscan forces join: Their various arms afford a pleasing sight; A peaceful \
train they seem, in peace prepar'd for fight. Betwixt the ranks the proud \
commanders ride, Glitt'ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed; Here \
Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line, And there Messapus, born of seed \
divine. The sign is giv'n; and, round the listed space, Each man in order \
fills his proper place. Reclining on their ample shields, they stand, And fix \
their pointed lances in the sand. Now, studious of the sight, a num'rous \
throng Of either sex promiscuous, old and young, Swarm the town: by those who \
rest behind, The gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd. Meantime the \
Queen of Heav'n beheld the sight, With eyes unpleas'd, from Mount Albano's \
height (Since call'd Albano by succeeding fame, But then an empty hill, \
without a name). She thence survey'd the field, the Trojan pow'rs, The Latian \
squadrons, and Laurentine tow'rs. Then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke, \
With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake, King Turnus' sister, once a \
lovely maid, Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betray'd: Compress'd by force, \
but, by the grateful god, Now made the Nais of the neighb'ring flood. \"O \
nymph, the pride of living lakes,\" said she, \"O most renown'd, and most \
belov'd by me, Long hast thou known, nor need I to record, The wanton sallies \
of my wand'ring lord. Of ev'ry Latian fair whom Jove misled To mount by \
stealth my violated bed, To thee alone I grudg'd not his embrace, But gave a \
part of heav'n, and an unenvied place. Now learn from me thy near approaching \
grief, Nor think my wishes want to thy relief. While fortune favor'd, nor \
Heav'n's King denied To lend my succor to the Latian side, I sav'd thy \
brother, and the sinking state: But now he struggles with unequal fate, And \
goes, with gods averse, o'ermatch'd in might, To meet inevitable death in \
fight; Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight. Thou, if thou \
dar'st thy present aid supply; It well becomes a sister's care to try.\" At \
this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress'd, Thrice tore her hair, and beat \
her comely breast. To whom Saturnia thus: \"Thy tears are late: Haste, snatch \
him, if he can be snatch'd from fate: New tumults kindle; violate the truce: \
Who knows what changeful fortune may produce? 'T is not a crime t' attempt \
what I decree; Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me.\" She said, and, \
sailing on the winged wind, Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind. And now \
pomp the peaceful kings appear: Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear; \
Twelve golden beams around his temples play, To mark his lineage from the God \
of Day. Two snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke, And in his hand two massy \
spears he shook: Then issued from the camp, in arms divine, Aeneas, author of \
the Roman line; And by his side Ascanius took his place, The second hope of \
Rome's immortal race. Adorn'd in white, a rev'rend priest appears, And \
off'rings to the flaming altars bears; A porket, and a lamb that never \
suffer'd shears. Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes, And strews the \
beasts, design'd for sacrifice, With salt and meal: with like officious care \
He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair. Betwixt their horns the \
purple wine he sheds; With the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds. Aeneas \
then unsheath'd his shining sword, And thus with pious pray'rs the gods \
ador'd: \"All-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil, For which I have sustain'd \
so long a toil, Thou, King of Heav'n, and thou, the Queen of Air, Propitious \
now, and reconcil'd by pray'r; Thou, God of War, whose unresisted sway The \
labors and events of arms obey; Ye living fountains, and ye running floods, \
All pow'rs of ocean, all ethereal gods, Hear, and bear record: if I fall in \
field, Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield, My Trojans shall encrease \
Evander's town; Ascanius shall renounce th' Ausonian crown: All claims, all \
questions of debate, shall cease; Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the \
peace. But, if my juster arms prevail in fight, (As sure they shall, if I \
divine aright,) My Trojans shall not o'er th' Italians reign: Both equal, \
both unconquer'd shall remain, Join'd in their laws, their lands, and their \
abodes; I ask but altars for my weary gods. The care of those religious rites \
be mine; The crown to King Latinus I resign: His be the sov'reign sway. Nor \
will I share His pow'r in peace, or his command in war. For me, my friends \
another town shall frame, And bless the rising tow'rs with fair Lavinia's \
name.\" Thus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands, The Latian king before \
his altar stands. \"By the same heav'n,\" said he, \"and earth, and main, And \
all the pow'rs that all the three contain; By hell below, and by that upper \
god Whose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod; So let Latona's \
double offspring hear, And double-fronted Janus, what I swear: I touch the \
sacred altars, touch the flames, And all those pow'rs attest, and all their \
names; Whatever chance befall on either side, No term of time this union \
shall divide: No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind, Or shake the \
steadfast tenor of my mind; Not tho' the circling seas should break their \
bound, O'erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground; Not tho' the lamps of \
heav'n their spheres forsake, Hurl'd down, and hissing in the nether lake: \
Ev'n as this royal scepter\" (for he bore A scepter in his hand) \"shall \
never more Shoot out in branches, or renew the birth: An orphan now, cut from \
the mother earth By the keen ax, dishonor'd of its hair, And cas'd in brass, \
for Latian kings to bear.\" When thus in public view the peace was tied With \
solemn vows, and sworn on either side, All dues perform'd which holy rites \
require; The victim beasts are slain before the fire, The trembling entrails \
from their bodies torn, And to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne. Already \
the Rutulians deem their man O'ermatch'd in arms, before the fight began. \
First rising fears are whisper'd thro' the crowd; Then, gath'ring sound, they \
murmur more aloud. Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes The \
champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size: The nearer they approach, the \
more is known Th' apparent disadvantage of their own. Turnus himself appears \
in public sight Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight. Slowly he moves, \
and at his altar stands With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands; And, \
while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs, A livid deadness in his cheeks \
appears. With anxious pleasure when Juturna view'd Th' increasing fright of \
the mad multitude, When their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard, And \
found their ready minds for change prepar'd; Dissembling her immortal form, \
she took Camertus' mien, his habit, and his look; A chief of ancient blood; \
in arms well known Was his great sire, and he his greater son. His shape \
assum'd, amid the ranks she ran, And humoring their first motions, thus \
began: \"For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight Of one expos'd for all, \
in single fight? Can we, before the face of heav'n, confess Our courage \
colder, or our numbers less? View all the Trojan host, th' Arcadian band, And \
Tuscan army; count 'em as they stand: Undaunted to the battle if we go, \
Scarce ev'ry second man will share a foe. Turnus, 't is true, in this unequal \
strife, Shall lose, with honor, his devoted life, Or change it rather for \
immortal fame, Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came: But you, a \
servile and inglorious band, For foreign lords shall sow your native land, \
Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd, Which have so long their \
lazy sons sustain'd.\" With words like these, she carried her design: A \
rising murmur runs along the line. Then ev'n the city troops, and Latians, \
tir'd With tedious war, seem with new souls inspir'd: Their champion's fate \
with pity they lament, And of the league, so lately sworn, repent. Nor fails \
the goddess to foment the rage With lying wonders, and a false presage; But \
adds a sign, which, present to their eyes, Inspires new courage, and a glad \
surprise. For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above, Appears in pomp th' \
imperial bird of Jove: A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes, And \
o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes; Then, stooping on the fairest \
of the train, In his strong talons truss'd a silver swan. Th' Italians wonder \
at th' unusual sight; But, while he lags, and labors in his flight, Behold, \
the dastard fowl return anew, And with united force the foe pursue: Clam'rous \
around the royal hawk they fly, And, thick'ning in a cloud, o'ershade the \
sky. They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course; Nor can th' \
incumber'd bird sustain their force; But vex'd, not vanquish'd, drops the \
pond'rous prey, And, lighten'd of his burthen, wings his way. Th' Ausonian \
bands with shouts salute the sight, Eager of action, and demand the fight. \
Then King Tolumnius, vers'd in augurs' arts, Cries out, and thus his boasted \
skill imparts: \"At length 't is granted, what I long desir'd! This, this is \
what my frequent vows requir'd. Ye gods, I take your omen, and obey. Advance, \
my friends, and charge! I lead the way. These are the foreign foes, whose \
impious band, Like that rapacious bird, infest our land: But soon, like him, \
they shall be forc'd to sea By strength united, and forego the prey. Your \
timely succor to your country bring, Haste to the rescue, and redeem your \
king.\" He said; and, pressing onward thro' the crew, Pois'd in his lifted \
arm, his lance he threw. The winged weapon, whistling in the wind, Came \
driving on, nor miss'd the mark design'd. At once the cornel rattled in the \
skies; At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise. Nine brothers in a goodly \
band there stood, Born of Arcadian mix'd with Tuscan blood, Gylippus' sons: \
the fatal jav'lin flew, Aim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew. A passage \
thro' the jointed arms it found, Just where the belt was to the body bound, \
And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground. Then, fir'd with pious \
rage, the gen'rous train Run madly forward to revenge the slain. And some \
with eager haste their jav'lins throw; And some with sword in hand assault \
the foe. The wish'd insult the Latine troops embrace, And meet their ardor in \
the middle space. The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line, With equal courage \
obviate their design. Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate Both armies \
urges to their mutual fate. With impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd, \
The sacrifice half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd. Thick storms of steel from \
either army fly, And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky; Brands from \
the fire are missive weapons made, With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly \
trade. Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray, And bears his unregarded \
gods away. These on their horses vault; those yoke the car; The rest, with \
swords on high, run headlong to the war. Messapus, eager to confound the \
peace, Spurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting prease, At King Aulestes, \
by his purple known A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown; And, with a \
shock encount'ring, bore him down. Backward he fell; and, as his fate \
design'd, The ruins of an altar were behind: There, pitching on his shoulders \
and his head, Amid the scatt'ring fires he lay supinely spread. The beamy \
spear, descending from above, His cuirass pierc'd, and thro' his body drove. \
Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries: \"The gods have found a fitter \
sacrifice.\" Greedy of spoils, th' Italians strip the dead Of his rich armor, \
and uncrown his head. Priest Corynaeus, arm'd his better hand, From his own \
altar, with a blazing brand; And, as Ebusus with a thund'ring pace Advanc'd \
to battle, dash'd it on his face: His bristly beard shines out with sudden \
fires; The crackling crop a noisome scent expires. Following the blow, he \
seiz'd his curling crown With his left hand; his other cast him down. The \
prostrate body with his knees he press'd, And plung'd his holy poniard in his \
breast. While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued The shepherd Alsus thro' \
the flying crowd, Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow Full on the front \
of his unwary foe. The broad ax enters with a crashing sound, And cleaves the \
chin with one continued wound; Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his \
arms around An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress'd, And seal'd their heavy \
lids in endless rest. But good Aeneas rush'd amid the bands; Bare was his \
head, and naked were his hands, In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud: \
\"What sudden rage, what new desire of blood, Inflames your alter'd minds? O \
Trojans, cease From impious arms, nor violate the peace! By human sanctions, \
and by laws divine, The terms are all agreed; the war is mine. Dismiss your \
fears, and let the fight ensue; This hand alone shall right the gods and you: \
Our injur'd altars, and their broken vow, To this avenging sword the \
faithless Turnus owe.\" Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defense, A winged \
arrow struck the pious prince. But, whether from some human hand it came, Or \
hostile god, is left unknown by fame: No human hand or hostile god was found, \
To boast the triumph of so base a wound. When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the \
plain, His chiefs dismay'd, his troops a fainting train, Th' unhop'd event \
his heighten'd soul inspires: At once his arms and coursers he requires; \
Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains, And with a ready hand assumes the \
reins. He drives impetuous, and, where'er he goes, He leaves behind a lane of \
slaughter'd foes. These his lance reaches; over those he rolls His rapid car, \
and crushes out their souls: In vain the vanquish'd fly; the victor sends The \
dead men's weapons at their living friends. Thus, on the banks of Hebrus' \
freezing flood, The God of Battles, in his angry mood, Clashing his sword \
against his brazen shield, Let loose the reins, and scours along the field: \
Before the wind his fiery coursers fly; Groans the sad earth, resounds the \
rattling sky. Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair (Dire faces, and \
deform'd) surround the car; Friends of the god, and followers of the war. \
With fury not unlike, nor less disdain, Exulting Turnus flies along the \
plain: His smoking horses, at their utmost speed, He lashes on, and urges \
o'er the dead. Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound, The gore \
and gath'ring dust are dash'd around. Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the \
war, He kill'd at hand, but Sthenelus afar: From far the sons of Imbracus he \
slew, Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew; Both taught to fight on foot, in \
battle join'd, Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind. Meantime \
Eumedes, vaunting in the field, New fir'd the Trojans, and their foes \
repell'd. This son of Dolon bore his grandsire's name, But emulated more his \
father's fame; His guileful father, sent a nightly spy, The Grecian camp and \
order to descry: Hard enterprise! and well he might require Achilles' car and \
horses, for his hire: But, met upon the scout, th' Aetolian prince In death \
bestow'd a juster recompense. Fierce Turnus view'd the Trojan from afar, And \
launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car; Then lightly leaping down, pursued \
the blow, And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe, Wrench'd from his \
feeble hold the shining sword, And plung'd it in the bosom of its lord. \
\"Possess,\" said he, \"the fruit of all thy pains, And measure, at thy \
length, our Latian plains. Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand; Thus may \
they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!\" Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris \
he slew, Whom o'er his neck his flound'ring courser threw. As when loud \
Boreas, with his blust'ring train, Stoops from above, incumbent on the main; \
Where'er he flies, he drives the rack before, And rolls the billows on th' \
Aegaean shore: So, where resistless Turnus takes his course, The scatter'd \
squadrons bend before his force; His crest of horses' hair is blown behind By \
adverse air, and rustles in the wind. This haughty Phegeus saw with high \
disdain, And, as the chariot roll'd along the plain, Light from the ground he \
leapt, and seiz'd the rein. Thus hung in air, he still retain'd his hold, The \
coursers frighted, and their course controll'd. The lance of Turnus reach'd \
him as he hung, And pierc'd his plated arms, but pass'd along, And only raz'd \
the skin. He turn'd, and held Against his threat'ning foe his ample shield; \
Then call'd for aid: but, while he cried in vain, The chariot bore him \
backward on the plain. He lies revers'd; the victor king descends, And \
strikes so justly where his helmet ends, He lops the head. The Latian fields \
are drunk With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk. While he triumphs, \
and while the Trojans yield, The wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field: \
Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried, And young Ascanius, weeping by his \
side, Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear His limbs from earth, \
supported on his spear. Resolv'd in mind, regardless of the smart, He tugs \
with both his hands, and breaks the dart. The steel remains. No readier way \
he found To draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound. Eager of fight, \
impatient of delay, He begs; and his unwilling friends obey. Iapis was at \
hand to prove his art, Whose blooming youth so fir'd Apollo's heart, That, \
for his love, he proffer'd to bestow His tuneful harp and his unerring bow. \
The pious youth, more studious how to save His aged sire, now sinking to the \
grave, Preferr'd the pow'r of plants, and silent praise Of healing arts, \
before Phoebean bays. Propp'd on his lance the pensive hero stood, And heard \
and saw, unmov'd, the mourning crowd. The fam'd physician tucks his robes \
around With ready hands, and hastens to the wound. With gentle touches he \
performs his part, This way and that, soliciting the dart, And exercises all \
his heav'nly art. All soft'ning simples, known of sov'reign use, He presses \
out, and pours their noble juice. These first infus'd, to lenify the pain, He \
tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain. Then to the patron of his art he \
pray'd: The patron of his art refus'd his aid. Meantime the war approaches to \
the tents; Th' alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments: The driving dust \
proclaims the danger near; And first their friends, and then their foes \
appear: Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear. The camp is fill'd \
with terror and affright: The hissing shafts within the trench alight; An \
undistinguish'd noise ascends the sky, The shouts those who kill, and groans \
of those who die. But now the goddess mother, mov'd with grief, And pierc'd \
with pity, hastens her relief. A branch of healing dittany she brought, Which \
in the Cretan fields with care she sought: Rough is the stern, which woolly \
leafs surround; The leafs with flow'rs, the flow'rs with purple crown'd, Well \
known to wounded goats; a sure relief To draw the pointed steel, and ease the \
grief. This Venus brings, in clouds involv'd, and brews Th' extracted liquor \
with ambrosian dews, And odorous panacee. Unseen she stands, Temp'ring the \
mixture with her heav'nly hands, And pours it in a bowl, already crown'd With \
juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the wound. The leech, unknowing of \
superior art Which aids the cure, with this foments the part; And in a moment \
ceas'd the raging smart. Stanch'd is the blood, and in the bottom stands: The \
steel, but scarcely touch'd with tender hands, Moves up, and follows of its \
own accord, And health and vigor are at once restor'd. Iapis first perceiv'd \
the closing wound, And first the footsteps of a god he found. \"Arms! arms!\" \
he cries; \"the sword and shield prepare, And send the willing chief, \
renew'd, to war. This is no mortal work, no cure of mine, Nor art's effect, \
but done by hands divine. Some god our general to the battle sends; Some god \
preserves his life for greater ends.\" The hero arms in haste; his hands \
infold His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold: Inflam'd to fight, and \
rushing to the field, That hand sustaining the celestial shield, This gripes \
the lance, and with such vigor shakes, That to the rest the beamy weapon \
quakes. Then with a close embrace he strain'd his son, And, kissing thro' his \
helmet, thus begun: \"My son, from my example learn the war, In camps to \
suffer, and in fields to dare; But happier chance than mine attend thy care! \
This day my hand thy tender age shall shield, And crown with honors of the \
conquer'd field: Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth To toils of \
war, be mindful of my worth; Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known, For \
Hector's nephew, and Aeneas' son.\" He said; and, striding, issued on the \
plain. Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num'rous train, Attend his steps; the rest \
their weapons take, And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake. A cloud of \
blinding dust is rais'd around, Labors beneath their feet the trembling \
ground. Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far Beheld the progress of the \
moving war: With him the Latins view'd the cover'd plains, And the chill \
blood ran backward in their veins. Juturna saw th' advancing troops appear, \
And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear. Aeneas leads; and draws a \
sweeping train, Clos'd in their ranks, and pouring on the plain. As when a \
whirlwind, rushing to the shore From the mid ocean, drives the waves before; \
The painful hind with heavy heart foresees The flatted fields, and slaughter \
of the trees; With like impetuous rage the prince appears Before his doubled \
front, nor less destruction bears. And now both armies shock in open field; \
Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill'd. Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain \
(All fam'd in arms, and of the Latian train) By Gyas', Mnestheus', and \
Achates' hand. The fatal augur falls, by whose command The truce was broken, \
and whose lance, embrued With Trojan blood, th' unhappy fight renew'd. Loud \
shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky, And o'er the field the frighted \
Latins fly. The prince disdains the dastards to pursue, Nor moves to meet in \
arms the fighting few; Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain, He seeks, and to \
the combat calls in vain. Juturna heard, and, seiz'd with mortal fear, Forc'd \
from the beam her brother's charioteer; Assumes his shape, his armor, and his \
mien, And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen. As the black swallow near the \
palace plies; O'er empty courts, and under arches, flies; Now hawks aloft, \
now skims along the flood, To furnish her loquacious nest with food: So \
drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains; The smoking horses run with \
loosen'd reins. She steers a various course among the foes; Now here, now \
there, her conqu'ring brother shows; Now with a straight, now with a wheeling \
flight, She turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight. Aeneas, fir'd with \
fury, breaks the crowd, And seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud: He runs \
within a narrower ring, and tries To stop the chariot; but the chariot flies. \
If he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears, And far away the Daunian hero bears. \
What should he do! Nor arts nor arms avail; And various cares in vain his \
mind assail. The great Messapus, thund'ring thro' the field, In his left hand \
two pointed jav'lins held: Encount'ring on the prince, one dart he drew, And \
with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw. Aeneas saw it come, and, stooping \
low Beneath his buckler, shunn'd the threat'ning blow. The weapon hiss'd \
above his head, and tore The waving plume which on his helm he wore. Forced \
by this hostile act, and fir'd with spite, That flying Turnus still declin'd \
the fight, The Prince, whose piety had long repell'd His inborn ardor, now \
invades the field; Invokes the pow'rs of violated peace, Their rites and \
injur'd altars to redress; Then, to his rage abandoning the rein, With blood \
and slaughter'd bodies fills the plain. What god can tell, what numbers can \
display, The various labors of that fatal day; What chiefs and champions fell \
on either side, In combat slain, or by what deaths they died; Whom Turnus, \
whom the Trojan hero kill'd; Who shar'd the fame and fortune of the field! \
Jove, could'st thou view, and not avert thy sight, Two jarring nations join'd \
in cruel fight, Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite! Aeneas \
first Rutulian Sucro found, Whose valor made the Trojans quit their ground; \
Betwixt his ribs the jav'lin drove so just, It reach'd his heart, nor needs a \
second thrust. Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; First from his \
horse fierce Amycus he threw: Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail'd \
Diores, and in equal fight prevail'd. Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon \
the place; Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. Three cold on \
earth the Trojan hero threw, Whom without respite at one charge he slew: \
Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress'd, And sad Onythes, added to the rest, \
Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore. Turnus two brothers from the Lycian \
shore, And from Apollo's fane to battle sent, O'erthrew; nor Phoebus could \
their fate prevent. Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill'd, Who long had \
shunn'd the dangers of the field: On Lerna's lake a silent life he led, And \
with his nets and angle earn'd his bread; Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he \
knew, But wisely from th' infectious world withdrew: Poor was his house; his \
father's painful hand Discharg'd his rent, and plow'd another's land. As \
flames among the lofty woods are thrown On diff'rent sides, and both by winds \
are blown; The laurels crackle in the sputt'ring fire; The frighted sylvans \
from their shades retire: Or as two neighb'ring torrents fall from high; \
Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry; They roll to sea with unresisted force, \
And down the rocks precipitate their course: Not with less rage the rival \
heroes take Their diff'rent ways, nor less destruction make. With spears \
afar, with swords at hand, they strike; And zeal of slaughter fires their \
souls alike. Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field; And hearts \
are pierc'd, unknowing how to yield: They blow for blow return, and wound for \
wound; And heaps of bodies raise the level ground. Murranus, boasting of his \
blood, that springs From a long royal race of Latian kings, Is by the Trojan \
from his chariot thrown, Crush'd with the weight of an unwieldy stone: \
Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore His living load, his dying \
body tore. His starting steeds, to shun the glitt'ring sword, Paw down his \
trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord. Fierce Hyllus threaten'd high, and, \
face to face, Affronted Turnus in the middle space: The prince encounter'd \
him in full career, And at his temples aim'd the deadly spear; So fatally the \
flying weapon sped, That thro' his helm it pierc'd his head. Nor, Cisseus, \
couldst thou scape from Turnus' hand, In vain the strongest of th' Arcadian \
band: Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford Availing aid against th' Aenean \
sword, Which to his naked heart pursued the course; Nor could his plated \
shield sustain the force. Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow'rs, Nor great \
subverter of the Trojan tow'rs, Were doom'd to kill, while Heav'n prolong'd \
his date; But who can pass the bounds, prefix'd by fate? In high Lyrnessus, \
and in Troy, he held Two palaces, and was from each expell'd: Of all the \
mighty man, the last remains A little spot of foreign earth contains. And now \
both hosts their broken troops unite In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight. \
Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line: \
Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads The Latin squadrons, and to battle \
leads. They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space, Resolv'd on \
death, impatient of disgrace; And, where one falls, another fills his place. \
The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son To leave th' unfinish'd fight, and \
storm the town: For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain In quest of \
Turnus, whom he seeks in vain, He views th' unguarded city from afar, In \
careless quiet, and secure of war. Occasion offers, and excites his mind To \
dare beyond the task he first design'd. Resolv'd, he calls his chiefs; they \
leave the fight: Attended thus, he takes a neighb'ring height; The crowding \
troops about their gen'ral stand, All under arms, and wait his high command. \
Then thus the lofty prince: \"Hear and obey, Ye Trojan bands, without the \
least delay Jove is with us; and what I have decreed Requires our utmost \
vigor, and our speed. Your instant arms against the town prepare, The source \
of mischief, and the seat of war. This day the Latian tow'rs, that mate the \
sky, Shall level with the plain in ashes lie: The people shall be slaves, \
unless in time They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime. Twice have our \
foes been vanquish'd on the plain: Then shall I wait till Turnus will be \
slain? Your force against the perjur'd city bend. There it began, and there \
the war shall end. The peace profan'd our rightful arms requires; Cleanse the \
polluted place with purging fires.\" He finish'd; and, one soul inspiring \
all, Form'd in a wedge, the foot approach the wall. Without the town, an \
unprovided train Of gaping, gazing citizens are slain. Some firebrands, \
others scaling ladders bear, And those they toss aloft, and these they rear: \
The flames now launch'd, the feather'd arrows fly, And clouds of missive arms \
obscure the sky. Advancing to the front, the hero stands, And, stretching out \
to heav'n his pious hands, Attests the gods, asserts his innocence, Upbraids \
with breach of faith th' Ausonian prince; Declares the royal honor doubly \
stain'd, And twice the rites of holy peace profan'd. Dissenting clamors in \
the town arise; Each will be heard, and all at once advise. One part for \
peace, and one for war contends; Some would exclude their foes, and some \
admit their friends. The helpless king is hurried in the throng, And, \
whate'er tide prevails, is borne along. Thus, when the swain, within a hollow \
rock, Invades the bees with suffocating smoke, They run around, or labor on \
their wings, Disus'd to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings; To shun the \
bitter fumes in vain they try; Black vapors, issuing from the vent, involve \
the sky. But fate and envious fortune now prepare To plunge the Latins in the \
last despair. The queen, who saw the foes invade the town, And brands on tops \
of burning houses thrown, Cast round her eyes, distracted with her fear- No \
troops of Turnus in the field appear. Once more she stares abroad, but still \
in vain, And then concludes the royal youth is slain. Mad with her anguish, \
impotent to bear The mighty grief, she loathes the vital air. She calls \
herself the cause of all this ill, And owns the dire effects of her \
ungovern'd will; She raves against the gods; she beats her breast; She tears \
with both her hands her purple vest: Then round a beam a running noose she \
tied, And, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died. Soon as the fatal news by \
Fame was blown, And to her dames and to her daughter known, The sad Lavinia \
rends her yellow hair And rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share: With \
shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair. The spreading rumor fills \
the public place: Confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace, And silent \
shame, are seen in ev'ry face. Latinus tears his garments as he goes, Both \
for his public and his private woes; With filth his venerable beard besmears, \
And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs. And much he blames the softness of \
his mind, Obnoxious to the charms of womankind, And soon seduc'd to change \
what he so well design'd; To break the solemn league so long desir'd, Nor \
finish what his fates, and those of Troy, requir'd. Now Turnus rolls aloof \
o'er empty plains, And here and there some straggling foes he gleans. His \
flying coursers please him less and less, Asham'd of easy fight and cheap \
success. Thus half-contented, anxious in his mind, The distant cries come \
driving in the wind, Shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown'd; A \
jarring mixture, and a boding sound. \"Alas!\" said he, \"what mean these \
dismal cries? What doleful clamors from the town arise?\" Confus'd, he stops, \
and backward pulls the reins. She who the driver's office now sustains, \
Replies: \"Neglect, my lord, these new alarms; Here fight, and urge the \
fortune of your arms: There want not others to defend the wall. If by your \
rival's hand th' Italians fall, So shall your fatal sword his friends \
oppress, In honor equal, equal in success.\" To this, the prince: \"O sister- \
for I knew The peace infring'd proceeded first from you; I knew you, when you \
mingled first in fight; And now in vain you would deceive my sight- Why, \
goddess, this unprofitable care? Who sent you down from heav'n, involv'd in \
air, Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain, And see your brother bleeding \
on the plain? For to what pow'r can Turnus have recourse, Or how resist his \
fate's prevailing force? These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground: Mighty \
the man, and mighty was the wound. I heard my dearest friend, with dying \
breath, My name invoking to revenge his death. Brave Ufens fell with honor on \
the place, To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace. On earth supine, a \
manly corpse he lies; His vest and armor are the victor's prize. Then, shall \
I see Laurentum in a flame, Which only wanted, to complete my shame? How will \
the Latins hoot their champion's flight! How Drances will insult and point \
them to the sight! Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below, (Since those \
above so small compassion show,) Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame, \
Which not belies my great forefather's name!\" He said; and while he spoke, \
with flying speed Came Sages urging on his foamy steed: Fix'd on his wounded \
face a shaft he bore, And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before: \"Turnus, \
on you, on you alone, depends Our last relief: compassionate your friends! \
Like lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on, With arms invests, with flames \
invades the town: The brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire To drive \
along the deluge of the fire. All eyes are fix'd on you: your foes rejoice; \
Ev'n the king staggers, and suspends his choice; Doubts to deliver or defend \
the town, Whom to reject, or whom to call his son. The queen, on whom your \
utmost hopes were plac'd, Herself suborning death, has breath'd her last. 'T \
is true, Messapus, fearless of his fate, With fierce Atinas' aid, defends the \
gate: On ev'ry side surrounded by the foe, The more they kill, the greater \
numbers grow; An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow. You, far \
aloof from your forsaken bands, Your rolling chariot drive o'er empty Stupid \
he sate, his eyes on earth declin'd, And various cares revolving in his mind: \
Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast, And sorrow mix'd with shame, his \
soul oppress'd; And conscious worth lay lab'ring in his thought, And love by \
jealousy to madness wrought. By slow degrees his reason drove away The mists \
of passion, and resum'd her sway. Then, rising on his car, he turn'd his \
look, And saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke. A wooden tow'r with flames \
already blaz'd, Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd; And bridges \
laid above to join the space, And wheels below to roll from place to place. \
\"Sister, the Fates have vanquish'd: let us go The way which Heav'n and my \
hard fortune show. The fight is fix'd; nor shall the branded name Of a base \
coward blot your brother's fame. Death is my choice; but suffer me to try My \
force, and vent my rage before I die.\" He said; and, leaping down without \
delay, Thro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way. Striding he pass'd, \
impetuous as the wind, And left the grieving goddess far behind. As when a \
fragment, from a mountain torn By raging tempests, or by torrents borne, Or \
sapp'd by time, or loosen'd from the roots- Prone thro' the void the rocky \
ruin shoots, Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep; Down sink, at \
once, the shepherds and their sheep: Involv'd alike, they rush to nether \
ground; Stunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from earth rebound: So \
Turnus, hasting headlong to the town, Should'ring and shoving, bore the \
squadrons down. Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew, Where shafts, \
and spears, and darts promiscuous flew, And sanguine streams the slipp'ry \
ground embrue. First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace, He cries \
aloud, to make the combat cease: \"Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire! \
The fight is mine; and me the gods require. 'T is just that I should \
vindicate alone The broken truce, or for the breach atone. This day shall \
free from wars th' Ausonian state, Or finish my misfortunes in my fate.\" \
Both armies from their bloody work desist, And, bearing backward, form a \
spacious list. The Trojan hero, who receiv'd from fame The welcome sound, and \
heard the champion's name, Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls, \
Greedy of war where greater glory calls. He springs to fight, exulting in his \
force His jointed armor rattles in the course. Like Eryx, or like Athos, \
great he shows, Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows, His head divine \
obscure in clouds he hides, And shakes the sounding forest on his sides. The \
nations, overaw'd, surcease the fight; Immovable their bodies, fix'd their \
sight. Ev'n death stands still; nor from above they throw Their darts, nor \
drive their batt'ring-rams below. In silent order either army stands, And \
drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands. Th' Ausonian king beholds, \
with wond'ring sight, Two mighty champions match'd in single fight, Born \
under climes remote, and brought by fate, With swords to try their titles to \
the state. Now, in clos'd field, each other from afar They view; and, rushing \
on, begin the war. They launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet; The \
trembling soil resounds beneath their feet: Their bucklers clash; thick blows \
descend from high, And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly. Courage \
conspires with chance, and both ingage With equal fortune yet, and mutual \
rage. As when two bulls for their fair female fight In Sila's shades, or on \
Taburnus' height; With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies; Mute stands \
the herd; the heifers roll their eyes, And wait th' event; which victor they \
shall bear, And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year: With rage of \
love the jealous rivals burn, And push for push, and wound for wound return; \
Their dewlaps gor'd, their sides are lav'd in blood; Loud cries and roaring \
sounds rebellow thro' the wood: Such was the combat in the listed ground; So \
clash their swords, and so their shields resound. Jove sets the beam; in \
either scale he lays The champions' fate, and each exactly weighs. On this \
side, life and lucky chance ascends; Loaded with death, that other scale \
descends. Rais'd on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow Full on the helm of \
his unguarded foe: Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side, As hopes \
and fears their panting hearts divide. But all in pieces flies the traitor \
sword, And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord. Now is but death, or \
flight; disarm'd he flies, When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies. Fame \
says that Turnus, when his steeds he join'd, Hurrying to war, disorder'd in \
his mind, Snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find. 'T was not \
the fated sword his father bore, But that his charioteer Metiscus wore. This, \
while the Trojans fled, the toughness held; But, vain against the great \
Vulcanian shield, The mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand: The shiver'd \
fragments shone amid the sand. Surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field, \
And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd; For here the Trojan troops the \
list surround, And there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground. \
Aeneas hastens, tho' with heavier pace- His wound, so newly knit, retards the \
chase, And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse- Yet, pressing foot by \
foot, his foe pursues. Thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around With \
crimson toils, or in a river found, High on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound \
appears, Still opening, following still, where'er he steers; The persecuted \
creature, to and fro, Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe: Steep \
is th' ascent, and, if he gains the land, The purple death is pitch'd along \
the strand. His eager foe, determin'd to the chase, Stretch'd at his length, \
gains ground at ev'ry pace; Now to his beamy head he makes his way, And now \
he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey: Just at the pinch, the stag springs \
out with fear; He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air: The \
rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries; The mortal tumult mounts, and \
thunders in the skies. Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames His \
tardy troops, and, calling by their names, Demands his trusty sword. The \
Trojan threats The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats To lay in ashes, \
if they dare supply With arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy: Thus menacing, he \
still pursues the course, With vigor, tho' diminish'd of his force. Ten times \
already round the listed place One chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the \
chase: No trivial prize is play'd; for on the life Or death of Turnus now \
depends the strife. Within the space, an olive tree had stood, A sacred \
shade, a venerable wood, For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god. \
Here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd, Of sinking mariners from \
shipwrack sav'd. With heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the tree, To make the \
ground inclos'd for combat free. Deep in the root, whether by fate, or \
chance, Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance; Then stoop'd, and tugg'd \
with force immense, to free Th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree; \
That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain, His flying weapon might from \
far attain. Confus'd with fear, bereft of human aid, Then Turnus to the gods, \
and first to Faunus pray'd: \"O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth, Where I \
thy foster son receiv'd my birth, Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand \
Your plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd, Propitious hear my pious \
pray'r!\" He said, Nor with successless vows invok'd their aid. Th' incumbent \
hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd; But still the stubborn earth the \
steel detain'd. Juturna took her time; and, while in vain He strove, assum'd \
Meticus' form again, And, in that imitated shape, restor'd To the despairing \
prince his Daunian sword. The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief, Saw \
the bold nymph afford this prompt relief, T' assert her offspring with a \
greater deed, From the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed. Once more \
erect, the rival chiefs advance: One trusts the sword, and one the pointed \
lance; And both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance. Meantime imperial \
Jove to Juno spoke, Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock: \"What new \
arrest, O Queen of Heav'n, is sent To stop the Fates now lab'ring in th' \
event? What farther hopes are left thee to pursue? Divine Aeneas, (and thou \
know'st it too,) Foredoom'd, to these celestial seats are due. What more \
attempts for Turnus can be made, That thus thou ling'rest in this lonely \
shade? Is it becoming of the due respect And awful honor of a god elect, A \
wound unworthy of our state to feel, Patient of human hands and earthly \
steel? Or seems it just, the sister should restore A second sword, when one \
was lost before, And arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror? For what, \
without thy knowledge and avow, Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do? At \
last, in deference to my love, forbear To lodge within thy soul this anxious \
care; Reclin'd upon my breast, thy grief unload: Who should relieve the \
goddess, but the god? Now all things to their utmost issue tend, Push'd by \
the Fates to their appointed While leave was giv'n thee, and a lawful hour \
For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r, Toss'd on the seas, thou couldst \
thy foes distress, And, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms oppress; Deform the \
royal house; and, from the side Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted \
bride: Now cease at my command.\" The Thund'rer said; And, with dejected \
eyes, this answer Juno made: \"Because your dread decree too well I knew, \
From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew. Else should you not behold \
me here, alone, Involv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan, But, girt with \
vengeful flames, in open sight Engag'd against my foes in mortal fight. 'T is \
true, Juturna mingled in the strife By my command, to save her brother's \
life- At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake, (The most religious oath the \
gods can take,) With this restriction, not to bend the bow, Or toss the \
spear, or trembling dart to throw. And now, resign'd to your superior might, \
And tir'd with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight. This let me beg (and this \
no fates withstand) Both for myself and for your father's land, That, when \
the nuptial bed shall bind the peace, (Which I, since you ordain, consent to \
bless,) The laws of either nation be the same; But let the Latins still \
retain their name, Speak the same language which they spoke before, Wear the \
same habits which their grandsires wore. Call them not Trojans: perish the \
renown And name of Troy, with that detested town. Latium be Latium still; let \
Alba reign And Rome's immortal majesty remain.\" Then thus the founder of \
mankind replies (Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes) \"Can Saturn's \
issue, and heav'n's other heir, Such endless anger in her bosom bear? Be \
mistress, and your full desires obtain; But quench the choler you foment in \
vain. From ancient blood th' Ausonian people sprung, Shall keep their name, \
their habit, and their tongue. The Trojans to their customs shall be tied: I \
will, myself, their common rites provide; The natives shall command, the \
foreigners subside. All shall be Latium; Troy without a name; And her lost \
sons forget from whence they came. From blood so mix'd, a pious race shall \
flow, Equal to gods, excelling all below. No nation more respect to you shall \
pay, Or greater off'rings on your altars lay.\" Juno consents, well pleas'd \
that her desires Had found success, and from the cloud retires. The peace \
thus made, the Thund'rer next prepares To force the wat'ry goddess from the \
wars. Deep in the dismal regions void of light, Three daughters at a birth \
were born to Night: These their brown mother, brooding on her care, Indued \
with windy wings to flit in air, With serpents girt alike, and crown'd with \
hissing hair. In heav'n the Dirae call'd, and still at hand, Before the \
throne of angry Jove they stand, His ministers of wrath, and ready still The \
minds of mortal men with fears to fill, Whene'er the moody sire, to wreak his \
hate On realms or towns deserving of their fate, Hurls down diseases, death \
and deadly care, And terrifies the guilty world with war. One sister plague \
if these from heav'n he sent, To fright Juturna with a dire portent. The pest \
comes whirling down: by far more slow Springs the swift arrow from the \
Parthian bow, Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies, And drench'd in \
pois'nous juice, the sure destruction flies. With such a sudden and unseen a \
flight Shot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night. Soon as the field \
inclos'd she had in view, And from afar her destin'd quarry knew, Contracted, \
to the boding bird she turns, Which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd \
urns, And beats about the tombs with nightly wings, Where songs obscene on \
sepulchers she sings. Thus lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries The \
Fury round unhappy Turnus flies, Flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his \
eyes. A lazy chillness crept along his blood; Chok'd was his voice; his hair \
with horror stood. Juturna from afar beheld her fly, And knew th' ill omen, \
by her screaming cry And stridor of her wings. Amaz'd with fear, Her \
beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair. \"Ah me!\" she cries, \
\"in this unequal strife What can thy sister more to save thy life? Weak as I \
am, can I, alas! contend In arms with that inexorable fiend? Now, now, I quit \
the field! forbear to fright My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night; The \
lashing of your wings I know too well, The sounding flight, and fun'ral \
screams of hell! These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove, The worthy \
recompense of ravish'd love! Did he for this exempt my life from fate? O hard \
conditions of immortal state, Tho' born to death, not privileg'd to die, But \
forc'd to bear impos'd eternity! Take back your envious bribes, and let me go \
Companion to my brother's ghost below! The joys are vanish'd: nothing now \
remains, Of life immortal, but immortal pains. What earth will open her \
devouring womb, To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!\" She drew a length of \
sighs; nor more she said, But in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head, Then \
plung'd into her stream, with deep despair, And her last sobs came bubbling \
up in air. Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear Against his foe, and thus \
upbraids his fear: \"What farther subterfuge can Turnus find? What empty \
hopes are harbor'd in his mind? 'T is not thy swiftness can secure thy \
flight; Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight. Vary thy shape in \
thousand forms, and dare What skill and courage can attempt in war; Wish for \
the wings of winds, to mount the sky; Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!\
\" The champion shook his head, and made this short reply: \"No threats of \
thine my manly mind can move; 'T is hostile heav'n I dread, and partial Jove.\
\" He said no more, but, with a sigh, repress'd The mighty sorrow in his \
swelling breast. Then, as he roll'd his troubled eyes around, An antique \
stone he saw, the common bound Of neighb'ring fields, and barrier of the \
ground; So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days Th' enormous weight \
from earth could hardly raise. He heav'd it at a lift, and, pois'd on high, \
Ran stagg'ring on against his enemy, But so disorder'd, that he scarcely knew \
His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw. His knocking knees are bent \
beneath the load, And shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood. The stone \
drops from his arms, and, falling short For want of vigor, mocks his vain \
effort. And as, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight, The sickly fancy \
labors in the night; We seem to run; and, destitute of force, Our sinking \
limbs forsake us in the course: In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry; \
The nerves, unbrac'd, their usual strength deny; And on the tongue the \
falt'ring accents die: So Turnus far'd; whatever means he tried, All force of \
arms and points of art employ'd, The Fury flew athwart, and made th' endeavor \
void. A thousand various thoughts his soul confound; He star'd about, nor aid \
nor issue found; His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround. Once \
more he pauses, and looks out again, And seeks the goddess charioteer in \
vain. Trembling he views the thund'ring chief advance, And brandishing aloft \
the deadly lance: Amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe, Forgets to \
ward, and waits the coming blow. Astonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with \
fear, Aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear. The hero measur'd \
first, with narrow view, The destin'd mark; and, rising as he threw, With its \
full swing the fatal weapon flew. Not with less rage the rattling thunder \
falls, Or stones from batt'ring-engines break the walls: Swift as a \
whirlwind, from an arm so strong, The lance drove on, and bore the death \
along. Naught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail, Nor aught, beneath \
his arms, the coat of mail: It pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound \
Transfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground. With groans the Latins rend \
the vaulted sky: Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply. Now low on \
earth the lofty chief is laid, With eyes cast upward, and with arms \
display'd, And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd: \"I know my death \
deserv'd, nor hope to live: Use what the gods and thy good fortune give. Yet \
think, O think, if mercy may be shown- Thou hadst a father once, and hast a \
son- Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave; And for Anchises' sake old \
Daunus save! Or, if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death, Give to my friends my \
body void of breath! The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life; Thine is the \
conquest, thine the royal wife: Against a yielded man, 't is mean ignoble \
strife.\" In deep suspense the Trojan seem'd to stand, And, just prepar'd to \
strike, repress'd his hand. He roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt His \
manly soul with more compassion melt; When, casting down a casual glance, he \
spied The golden belt that glitter'd on his side, The fatal spoils which \
haughty Turnus tore From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore. Then, rous'd anew \
to wrath, he loudly cries (Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his \
eyes) \"Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend, Clad, as thou art, in \
trophies of my friend? To his sad soul a grateful off'ring go! 'T is Pallas, \
Pallas gives this deadly blow.\" He rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word, \
Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword. The streaming blood distain'd his \
arms around, And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.  I. THE \

buyer or exploiter, in the fourth year he shall fix their liberty. 118. If he \
has handed over a manservant or a maidservant to work off a debt, and the \
merchant shall remove and sell them for money, no one can object. 119. If a \
debt has seized a man, and he has handed over for the money a maidservant who \
has borne him children, the money the merchant paid him the owner of the maid \
shall pay, and he shall ransom his maid. 120. If a man has heaped up his corn \
in a heap in the house of a man, and in the granary a disaster has taken \

house, the owner of the corn shall recount his corn before God, the owner of \
the house shall make up and return the corn which he took and shall give to \

case has no remedy. 124. If a man has given silver, gold, or anything \
whatever to a man on deposit before witnesses and he has disputed with him, \

lost, he shall make good and render to the owner of the goods, the owner of \
the house shall seek out whatever of his is lost and take it from the thief. \
126. If a man has lost nothing of his, but has said that something of his is \
lost, has exaggerated his loss, since nothing of his is lost, his loss he \
shall recount before God, and whatever he has claimed he shall make up and \

account and throw her into the waters. 134. If a man has been taken captive \
and in his house there is no maintenance, and his wife has entered into the \
house of another, that woman has no blame. 135. If a man has been taken \
captive and in his house there is no maintenance before her, his wife has \
entered into the house of another and has borne children, afterwards her \
husband has returned and regained his city, that woman shall return to her \
bridegroom, the children shall go after their father. 136. If a man has left \
his city and fled, after him his wife has entered the house of another, if \
that man shall return and has seized his wife, because he hated his city and \
fled, the wife of the truant shall not return to her husband. 137. If a man \
has set his face to put away his concubine who has borne him children or his \
wife who has granted him children, to that woman he shall return her her \
marriage portion and shall give her the usufruct of field, garden, and goods, \
and she shall bring up her children. From the time that her children are \
grown up, from whatever is given to her children they shall give her a share \
like that of one son, and she shall marry the husband of her choice. 138. If \
a man has put away his bride who has not borne him children, he shall give \
her money as much as her dowry, and shall pay her the marriage portion which \
she brought from her father's house, and shall put her away. 139. If there \
was no dowry, he shall give her one mina of silver for a divorce. 140. If he \
is a poor man, he shall give her one-third of a mina of silver. 141. If the \

her away,' he shall put her away and she shall go her way, he shall not give \
her anything for her divorce. If her husband has not said 'I put her away,' \
her husband shall marry another woman, that woman as a maidservant shall \
dwell in the house of her husband. 142. If a woman hates her husband and has \
said 'Thou shalt not possess me,' one shall enquire into her past what is her \
lack, and if she has been economical and has no vice, and her husband has \
gone out and greatly belittled her, that woman has no blame, she shall take \
her marriage portion and go off to her father's house. 143. If she has not \
been economical, a goer about, has wasted her house, has belittled her \

idiots approbation, Lost labour will be thy reward, Though they'll pretend \
appreciation. They say a goodly shade he finds Who shelters 'neath a goodly \
tree; And such a one thy kindly star In Bejar bath provided thee: A royal \
tree whose spreading boughs A show of princely fruit display; A tree that \
bears a noble Duke, The Alexander of his day. Of a Manchegan gentleman Thy \
purpose is to tell the story, Relating how he lost his wits O'er idle tales \
of love and glory, Of \"ladies, arms, and cavaliers:\" A new Orlando Furioso- \
Innamorato, rather--who Won Dulcinea del Toboso. Put no vain emblems on thy \
shield; All figures--that is bragging play. A modest dedication make, And \
give no scoffer room to say, \"What! Alvaro de Luna here? Or is it Hannibal \
again? Or does King Francis at Madrid Once more of destiny complain?\" Since \
Heaven it hath not pleased on thee Deep erudition to bestow, Or black \
Latino's gift of tongues, No Latin let thy pages show. Ape not philosophy or \
wit, Lest one who cannot comprehend, Make a wry face at thee and ask, \"Why \
offer flowers to me, my friend?\" Be not a meddler; no affair Of thine the \
life thy neighbours lead: Be prudent; oft the random jest Recoils upon the \
jester's head. Thy constant labour let it be To earn thyself an honest name, \
For fooleries preserved in print Are perpetuity of shame. A further counsel \
bear in mind: If that thy roof be made of glass, It shows small wit to pick \
up stones To pelt the people as they pass. Win the attention of the wise, And \
give the thinker food for thought; Whoso indites frivolities, Will but by \
simpletons be sought. AMADIS OF GAUL To Don Quixote of la Mancha SONNET Thou \
that didst imitate that life of mine When I in lonely sadness on the great \
Rock Pena Pobre sat disconsolate, In self-imposed penance there to pine; \
Thou, whose sole beverage was the bitter brine Of thine own tears, and who \
withouten plate Of silver, copper, tin, in lowly state Off the bare earth and \
on earth's fruits didst dine; Live thou, of thine eternal glory sure. So long \
as on the round of the fourth sphere The bright Apollo shall his coursers \
steer, In thy renown thou shalt remain secure, Thy country's name in story \
shall endure, And thy sage author stand without a peer. DON BELIANIS OF \
GREECE To Don Quixote of la Mancha SONNET In slashing, hewing, cleaving, word \
and deed, I was the foremost knight of chivalry, Stout, bold, expert, as e'er \
the world did see; Thousands from the oppressor's wrong I freed; Great were \
my feats, eternal fame their meed; In love I proved my truth and loyalty; The \
hugest giant was a dwarf for me; Ever to knighthood's laws gave I good heed. \
My mastery the Fickle Goddess owned, And even Chance, submitting to control, \
Grasped by the forelock, yielded to my will. Yet--though above yon horned \
moon enthroned My fortune seems to sit--great Quixote, still Envy of thy \
achievements fills my soul. THE LADY OF ORIANA To Dulcinea del Toboso SONNET \
Oh, fairest Dulcinea, could it be! It were a pleasant fancy to suppose so-- \
Could Miraflores change to El Toboso, And London's town to that which \
shelters thee! Oh, could mine but acquire that livery Of countless charms thy \
mind and body show so! Or him, now famous grown--thou mad'st him grow so-- \
Thy knight, in some dread combat could I see! Oh, could I be released from \
Amadis By exercise of such coy chastity As led thee gentle Quixote to \
dismiss! Then would my heavy sorrow turn to joy; None would I envy, all would \
envy me, And happiness be mine without alloy. GANDALIN, SQUIRE OF AMADIS OF \
GAUL, To Sancho Panza, squire of Don Quixote SONNET All hail, illustrious \
man! Fortune, when she Bound thee apprentice to the esquire trade, Her care \
and tenderness of thee displayed, Shaping thy course from misadventure free. \
No longer now doth proud knight-errantry Regard with scorn the sickle and the \
spade; Of towering arrogance less count is made Than of plain esquire-like \
simplicity. I envy thee thy Dapple, and thy name, And those alforjas thou \
wast wont to stuff With comforts that thy providence proclaim. Excellent \
Sancho! hail to thee again! To thee alone the Ovid of our Spain Does homage \
with the rustic kiss and cuff. FROM EL DONOSO, THE MOTLEY POET, On Sancho \

of La Mancha SONNET If thou art not a Peer, peer thou hast none; Among a \
thousand Peers thou art a peer; Nor is there room for one when thou art near, \
Unvanquished victor, great unconquered one! Orlando, by Angelica undone, Am \
I; o'er distant seas condemned to steer, And to Fame's altars as an offering \
bear Valour respected by Oblivion. I cannot be thy rival, for thy fame And \
prowess rise above all rivalry, Albeit both bereft of wits we go. But, though \
the Scythian or the Moor to tame Was not thy lot, still thou dost rival me: \
Love binds us in a fellowship of woe. THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUS To Don Quixote of \
La Mancha My sword was not to be compared with thine Phoebus of Spain, marvel \
of courtesy, Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mine That smote from east \
to west as lightnings fly. I scorned all empire, and that monarchy The rosy \
east held out did I resign For one glance of Claridiana's eye, The bright \
Aurora for whose love I pine. A miracle of constancy my love; And banished by \
her ruthless cruelty, This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame. But, \
Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove, For thou dost live in Dulcinea's \
name, And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee. FROM SOLISDAN To Don \
Quixote of La Mancha SONNET Your fantasies, Sir Quixote, it is true, That \
crazy brain of yours have quite upset, But aught of base or mean hath never \
yet Been charged by any in reproach to you. Your deeds are open proof in all \
men's view; For you went forth injustice to abate, And for your pains sore \
drubbings did you get From many a rascally and ruffian crew. If the fair \
Dulcinea, your heart's queen, Be unrelenting in her cruelty, If still your \
woe be powerless to move her, In such hard case your comfort let it be That \
Sancho was a sorry go-between: A booby he, hard-hearted she, and you no \
lover. DIALOGUE Between Babieca and Rocinante SONNET B. \"How comes it, \
Rocinante, you're so lean?\" R. \"I'm underfed, with overwork I'm worn.\" B. \
\"But what becomes of all the hay and corn?\" R. \"My master gives me none; \
he's much too mean.\" B. \"Come, come, you show ill-breeding, sir, I ween; 'T \
is like an ass your master thus to scorn.\" R. He is an ass, will die an ass, \
an ass was born; Why, he's in love; what's what's plainer to be seen?\" B. \
\"To be in love is folly?\"--R. \"No great sense.\" B. \"You're metaphysical.\
\"--R. \"From want of food.\" B. \"Rail at the squire, then.\"--R. \"Why, \
what's the good? I might indeed complain of him, I grant ye, But, squire or \
master, where's the difference? They're both as sorry hacks as Rocinante.\" \
THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE Idle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath \
that I would this book, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, \
gayest, and cleverest that could be imagined. But I could not counteract \
Nature's law that everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could this \
sterile, illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry, shrivelled, \
whimsical offspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came \
into any other imagination--just what might be begotten in a prison, where \
every misery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling? \
Tranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, bright skies, murmuring \
brooks, peace of mind, these are the things that go far to make even the most \
barren muses fertile, and bring into the world births that fill it with \
wonder and delight. Sometimes when a father has an ugly, loutish son, the \
love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that he does not see his defects, \
or, rather, takes them for gifts and charms of mind and body, and talks of \
them to his friends as wit and grace. I, however--for though I pass for the \
father, I am but the stepfather to \"Don Quixote\"--have no desire to go with \
the current of custom, or to implore thee, dearest reader, almost with tears \
in my eyes, as others do, to pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceive \
in this child of mine. Thou art neither its kinsman nor its friend, thy soul \
is thine own and thy will as free as any man's, whate'er he be, thou art in \
thine own house and master of it as much as the king of his taxes and thou \
knowest the common saying, \"Under my cloak I kill the king;\" all which \
exempts and frees thee from every consideration and obligation, and thou \
canst say what thou wilt of the story without fear of being abused for any \
ill or rewarded for any good thou mayest say of it. My wish would be simply \
to present it to thee plain and unadorned, without any embellishment of \
preface or uncountable muster of customary sonnets, epigrams, and eulogies, \
such as are commonly put at the beginning of books. For I can tell thee, \
though composing it cost me some labour, I found none greater than the making \
of this Preface thou art now reading. Many times did I take up my pen to \
write it, and many did I lay it down again, not knowing what to write. One of \
these times, as I was pondering with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my \
elbow on the desk, and my cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say, \
there came in unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine, who, \
seeing me so deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, making no mystery \
of it, answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had to make for the \
story of \"Don Quixote,\" which so troubled me that I had a mind not to make \
any at all, nor even publish the achievements of so noble a knight. \"For, \
how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancient lawgiver \
they call the Public will say when it sees me, after slumbering so many years \
in the silence of oblivion, coming out now with all my years upon my back, \
and with a book as dry as a rush, devoid of invention, meagre in style, poor \
in thoughts, wholly wanting in learning and wisdom, without quotations in the \
margin or annotations at the end, after the fashion of other books I see, \
which, though all fables and profanity, are so full of maxims from Aristotle, \
and Plato, and the whole herd of philosophers, that they fill the readers \
with amazement and convince them that the authors are men of learning, \
erudition, and eloquence. And then, when they quote the Holy \
Scriptures!--anyone would say they are St. Thomases or other doctors of the \
Church, observing as they do a decorum so ingenious that in one sentence they \
describe a distracted lover and in the next deliver a devout little sermon \
that it is a pleasure and a treat to hear and read. Of all this there will be \
nothing in my book, for I have nothing to quote in the margin or to note at \
the end, and still less do I know what authors I follow in it, to place them \
at the beginning, as all do, under the letters A, B, C, beginning with \
Aristotle and ending with Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a \
slanderer and the other a painter. Also my book must do without sonnets at \
the beginning, at least sonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises, counts, \
bishops, ladies, or famous poets. Though if I were to ask two or three \
obliging friends, I know they would give me them, and such as the productions \
of those that have the highest reputation in our Spain could not equal. \"In \
short, my friend,\" I continued, \"I am determined that Senor Don Quixote \
shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha until Heaven provide \
some one to garnish him with all those things he stands in need of; because I \
find myself, through my shallowness and want of learning, unequal to \
supplying them, and because I am by nature shy and careless about hunting for \
authors to say what I myself can say without them. Hence the cogitation and \
abstraction you found me in, and reason enough, what you have heard from \
me.\" Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead and \
breaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, \"Before God, Brother, now am I \
disabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time I have \
known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd and sensible in \
all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as the heaven is from the \
earth. It is possible that things of so little moment and so easy to set \
right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours, fit to break through and \
crush far greater obstacles? By my faith, this comes, not of any want of \
ability, but of too much indolence and too little knowledge of life. Do you \
want to know if I am telling the truth? Well, then, attend to me, and you \
will see how, in the opening and shutting of an eye, I sweep away all your \
difficulties, and supply all those deficiencies which you say check and \
discourage you from bringing before the world the story of your famous Don \
Quixote, the light and mirror of all knight-errantry.\" \"Say on,\" said I, \
listening to his talk; \"how do you propose to make up for my diffidence, and \
reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I am in?\" To which he made answer, \
\"Your first difficulty about the sonnets, epigrams, or complimentary verses \
which you want for the beginning, and which ought to be by persons of \
importance and rank, can be removed if you yourself take a little trouble to \
make them; you can afterwards baptise them, and put any name you like to \
them, fathering them on Prester John of the Indies or the Emperor of \
Trebizond, who, to my knowledge, were said to have been famous poets: and \
even if they were not, and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and \
question the fact, never care two maravedis for that, for even if they prove \
a lie against you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with. \"As to \
references in the margin to the books and authors from whom you take the \
aphorisms and sayings you put into your story, it is only contriving to fit \
in nicely any sentences or scraps of Latin you may happen to have by heart, \
or at any rate that will not give you much trouble to look up; so as, when \
you speak of freedom and captivity, to insert _Non bene pro toto libertas \
venditur auro;_ and then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; \
or, if you allude to the power of death, to come in with-- _Pallida mors \
Aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas, Regumque turres._ \"If it be friendship \
and the love God bids us bear to our enemy, go at once to the Holy \
Scriptures, which you can do with a very small amount of research, and quote \
no less than the words of God himself: Ego autem dico vobis: diligite \
inimicos vestros. If you speak of evil thoughts, turn to the Gospel: De corde \
exeunt cogitationes malae. If of the fickleness of friends, there is Cato, \
who will give you his distich: _Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos, \
Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris._ \"With these and such like bits of \
Latin they will take you for a grammarian at all events, and that now-a-days \
is no small honour and profit. \"With regard to adding annotations at the end \
of the book, you may safely do it in this way. If you mention any giant in \
your book contrive that it shall be the giant Goliath, and with this alone, \
which will cost you almost nothing, you have a grand note, for you can \
put--The giant Golias or Goliath was a Philistine whom the shepherd David \
slew by a mighty stone-cast in the Terebinth valley, as is related in the \
Book of Kings--in the chapter where you find it written. \"Next, to prove \
yourself a man of erudition in polite literature and cosmography, manage that \
the river Tagus shall be named in your story, and there you are at once with \
another famous annotation, setting forth--The river Tagus was so called after \
a King of Spain: it has its source in such and such a place and falls into \
the ocean, kissing the walls of the famous city of Lisbon, and it is a common \
belief that it has golden sands, etc. If you should have anything to do with \
robbers, I will give you the story of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if with \
loose women, there is the Bishop of Mondonedo, who will give you the loan of \
Lamia, Laida, and Flora, any reference to whom will bring you great credit; \
if with hard-hearted ones, Ovid will furnish you with Medea; if with witches \
or enchantresses, Homer has Calypso, and Virgil Circe; if with valiant \
captains, Julius Caesar himself will lend you himself in his own \
'Commentaries,' and Plutarch will give you a thousand Alexanders. If you \
should deal with love, with two ounces you may know of Tuscan you can go to \
Leon the Hebrew, who will supply you to your heart's content; or if you \
should not care to go to foreign countries you have at home Fonseca's 'Of the \
Love of God,' in which is condensed all that you or the most imaginative mind \
can want on the subject. In short, all you have to do is to manage to quote \
these names, or refer to these stories I have mentioned, and leave it to me \
to insert the annotations and quotations, and I swear by all that's good to \
fill your margins and use up four sheets at the end of the book. \"Now let us \
come to those references to authors which other books have, and you want for \
yours. The remedy for this is very simple: You have only to look out for some \
book that quotes them all, from A to Z as you say yourself, and then insert \
the very same alphabet in your book, and though the imposition may be plain \
to see, because you have so little need to borrow from them, that is no \
matter; there will probably be some simple enough to believe that you have \
made use of them all in this plain, artless story of yours. At any rate, if \
it answers no other purpose, this long catalogue of authors will serve to \
give a surprising look of authority to your book. Besides, no one will \
trouble himself to verify whether you have followed them or whether you have \
not, being no way concerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book \
of yours has no need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it is, \
from beginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of which \
Aristotle never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero had any \
knowledge; nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations of astrology \
come within the range of its fanciful vagaries; nor have geometrical \
measurements or refutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to do \
with it; nor does it mean to preach to anybody, mixing up things human and \
divine, a sort of motley in which no Christian understanding should dress \
itself. It has only to avail itself of truth to nature in its composition, \
and the more perfect the imitation the better the work will be. And as this \
piece of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the authority and \
influence which books of chivalry have in the world and with the public, \
there is no need for you to go a-begging for aphorisms from philosophers, \
precepts from Holy Scripture, fables from poets, speeches from orators, or \
miracles from saints; but merely to take care that your style and diction run \
musically, pleasantly, and plainly, with clear, proper, and well-placed \
words, setting forth your purpose to the best of your power, and putting your \
ideas intelligibly, without confusion or obscurity. Strive, too, that in \
reading your story the melancholy may be moved to laughter, and the merry \
made merrier still; that the simple shall not be wearied, that the judicious \
shall admire the invention, that the grave shall not despise it, nor the wise \
fail to praise it. Finally, keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that \
ill-founded edifice of the books of chivalry, hated by some and praised by \
many more; for if you succeed in this you will have achieved no small \
success.\" In profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and his \
observations made such an impression on me that, without attempting to \
question them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them I determined to \
make this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou wilt perceive my friend's \
good sense, my good fortune in finding such an adviser in such a time of \
need, and what thou hast gained in receiving, without addition or alteration, \
the story of the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, who is held by all the \
inhabitants of the district of the Campo de Montiel to have been the chastest \
lover and the bravest knight that has for many years been seen in that \
neighbourhood. I have no desire to magnify the service I render thee in \
making thee acquainted with so renowned and honoured a knight, but I do \
desire thy thanks for the acquaintance thou wilt make with the famous Sancho \
Panza, his squire, in whom, to my thinking, I have given thee condensed all \
the squirely drolleries that are scattered through the swarm of the vain \
books of chivalry. And so--may God give thee health, and not forget me. Vale. \
DEDICATION OF VOLUME I TO THE DUKE OF BEJAR, MARQUIS OF GIBRALEON, COUNT OF \
BENALCAZAR AND BANARES, VICECOUNT OF THE PUEBLA DE ALCOCER, MASTER OF THE \
TOWNS OF CAPILLA, CURIEL AND BURGUILLOS In belief of the good reception and \
honours that Your Excellency bestows on all sort of books, as prince so \
inclined to favor good arts, chiefly those who by their nobleness do not \
submit to the service and bribery of the vulgar, I have determined bringing \
to light The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of la Mancha, in shelter of Your \
Excellency's glamorous name, to whom, with the obeisance I owe to such \
grandeur, I pray to receive it agreeably under his protection, so that in \
this shadow, though deprived of that precious ornament of elegance and \
erudition that clothe the works composed in the houses of those who know, it \
dares appear with assurance in the judgment of some who, trespassing the \
bounds of their own ignorance, use to condemn with more rigour and less \
justice the writings of others. It is my earnest hope that Your Excellency's \
good counsel in regard to my honourable purpose, will not disdain the \
littleness of so humble a service. Miguel de Cervantes VOLUME I. CHAPTER I. \
WHICH TREATS OF THE CHARACTER AND PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS GENTLEMAN DON \
QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no \
desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen \
that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a \
greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on \
most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so \
extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it \
went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for \
holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He \
had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad \
for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle \
the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he \
was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great \
sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here \
there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the \
subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was \
called Quexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; it \
will be enough not to stray a hair's breadth from the truth in the telling of \
it. You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at \
leisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to reading \
books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely \
neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his \
property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that he \
sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and \
brought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were none he \
liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva's composition, for \
their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, \
particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships and cartels, where \
he often found passages like \"the reason of the unreason with which my \
reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your \
beauty;\" or again, \"the high heavens, that of your divinity divinely \
fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness \
deserves.\" Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his wits, and \
used to lie awake striving to understand them and worm the meaning out of \
them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or extracted had he come \
to life again for that special purpose. He was not at all easy about the \
wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because it seemed to him that, great \
as were the surgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body \
covered all over with seams and scars. He commended, however, the author's \
way of ending his book with the promise of that interminable adventure, and \
many a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is \
there proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a successful \
piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing thoughts \
prevented him. Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a \
learned man, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better \
knight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village \
barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of \
Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with him it was Don \
Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that was equal \
to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose like his \
brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him. In \
short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from \
sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring over them; and what \
with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost his \
wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read about in his books, \
enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, \
and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the \
whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no \
history in the world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz \
was a very good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight of \
the Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce and \
monstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because at \
Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himself of the \
artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his arms. \
He approved highly of the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant \
breed which is always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and \
well-bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when \
he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and \
when beyond the seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history \
says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a \
Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain. \
In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that \
ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it was right \
and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for the service \
of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the \
world over in full armour and on horseback in quest of adventures, and \
putting in practice himself all that he had read of as being the usual \
practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing \
himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he was to reap eternal \
renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might of his \
arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment \
he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his \
scheme into execution. The first thing he did was to clean up some armour \
that had belonged to his great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying \
forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and \
polished it as best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that \
it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, \
however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of \
pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is \
true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew \
his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an \
instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had knocked \
it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he \
set to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he was satisfied \
with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments with it, \
he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction. He \
next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a real and \
more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that \"tantum pellis et ossa fuit,\" \
surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid. \
Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said \
to himself) it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so famous, \
and one with such merits of his own, should be without some distinctive name, \
and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before belonging \
to a knight-errant, and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, \
his master taking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it \
should be a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and \
calling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck out, \
rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his memory \
and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his thinking, \
lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack before he became \
what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world. Having \
got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to get one for \
himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this point, till at last \
he made up his mind to call himself \"Don Quixote,\" whence, as has been \
already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his \
name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and not Quesada as others would \
have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was not content to \
call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his \
kingdom and country to make it famous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, \
like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself \
Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his \
origin and country, and did honour to it in taking his surname from it. So \
then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack \
christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that nothing \
more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with; for a \
knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body \
without a soul. As he said to himself, \"If, for my sins, or by my good \
fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with \
knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to \
the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have \
some one I may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his \
knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, 'I am the \
giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania, vanquished in single \
combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, \
who has commanded me to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness \
dispose of me at your pleasure'?\" Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the \
delivery of this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call \
his Lady! There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very \
good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though, so \
far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name \
was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady \
of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not be out of \
harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of a princess and \
great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Toboso--she being of El \
Toboso--a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon, and significant, like all \
those he had already bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him. \
CHAPTER II. WHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE \
FROM HOME These preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer \
the execution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world \
was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right, grievances \
to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties to discharge. \
So, without giving notice of his intention to anyone, and without anybody \
seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day (which was one of the \
hottest of the month of July) he donned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante \
with his patched-up helmet on, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by the \
back door of the yard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment \
and satisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with his \
grand purpose. But scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain, when a \
terrible thought struck him, one all but enough to make him abandon the \
enterprise at the very outset. It occurred to him that he had not been dubbed \
a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry he neither could nor \
ought to bear arms against any knight; and that even if he had been, still he \
ought, as a novice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the \
shield until by his prowess he had earned one. These reflections made him \
waver in his purpose, but his craze being stronger than any reasoning, he \
made up his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came \
across, following the example of others in the same case, as he had read in \
the books that brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on \
the first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and \
so comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his horse chose, \
for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures. Thus setting out, our \
new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to himself and saying, \"Who \
knows but that in time to come, when the veracious history of my famous deeds \
is made known, the sage who writes it, when he has to set forth my first \
sally in the early morning, will do it after this fashion? 'Scarce had the \
rubicund Apollo spread o'er the face of the broad spacious earth the golden \
threads of his bright hair, scarce had the little birds of painted plumage \
attuned their notes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of \
the rosy Dawn, that, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was \
appearing to mortals at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan horizon, \
when the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, \
mounted his celebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and \
famous Campo de Montiel;'\" which in fact he was actually traversing. \"Happy \
the age, happy the time,\" he continued, \"in which shall be made known my \
deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble, limned in \
pictures, for a memorial for ever. And thou, O sage magician, whoever thou \
art, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this wondrous history, \
forget not, I entreat thee, my good Rocinante, the constant companion of my \
ways and wanderings.\" Presently he broke out again, as if he were \
love-stricken in earnest, \"O Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive heart, \
a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me forth with scorn, and with \
inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy beauty. O lady, deign \
to hold in remembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for \
love of thee.\" So he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, \
all in the style of those his books had taught him, imitating their language \
as well as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted \
so rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he \
had any. Nearly all day he travelled without anything remarkable happening to \
him, at which he was in despair, for he was anxious to encounter some one at \
once upon whom to try the might of his strong arm. Writers there are who say \
the first adventure he met with was that of Puerto Lapice; others say it was \
that of the windmills; but what I have ascertained on this point, and what I \
have found written in the annals of La Mancha, is that he was on the road all \
day, and towards nightfall his hack and he found themselves dead tired and \
hungry, when, looking all around to see if he could discover any castle or \
shepherd's shanty where he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, \
he perceived not far out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star \
guiding him to the portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and \
quickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting in. At the door \
were standing two young women, girls of the district as they call them, on \
their way to Seville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at \
the inn; and as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or \
imaged seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read \
of, the moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its \
four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the drawbridge \
and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort. To \
this inn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at a short distance \
from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would show himself upon \
the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight was \
approaching the castle. But seeing that they were slow about it, and that \
Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he made for the inn door, and \
perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there, and who seemed to him \
to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate. \
At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the \
stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that is what \
they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together, and \
forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was expecting, the signal of \
some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious satisfaction he \
rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man of this sort \
approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were turning in dismay \
into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by their flight, raising \
his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty visage, and with courteous \
bearing and gentle voice addressed them, \"Your ladyships need not fly or \
fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to the order of knighthood which I \
profess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as your appearance \
proclaims you to be.\" The girls were looking at him and straining their eyes \
to make out the features which the clumsy visor obscured, but when they heard \
themselves called maidens, a thing so much out of their line, they could not \
restrain their laughter, which made Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, \
\"Modesty becomes the fair, and moreover laughter that has little cause is \
great silliness; this, however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire \
is none other than to serve you.\" The incomprehensible language and the \
unpromising looks of our cavalier only increased the ladies' laughter, and \
that increased his irritation, and matters might have gone farther if at that \
moment the landlord had not come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very \
peaceful one. He, seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not \
match any more than his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not \
at all indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; \
but, in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it \
best to speak him fairly, so he said, \"Senor Caballero, if your worship \
wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is \
plenty of everything else here.\" Don Quixote, observing the respectful \
bearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed in \
his eyes), made answer, \"Sir Castellan, for me anything will suffice, for \
'My armour is my only wear, My only rest the fray.'\" The host fancied he \
called him Castellan because he took him for a \"worthy of Castile,\" though \
he was in fact an Andalusian, and one from the strand of San Lucar, as crafty \
a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks as a student or a page. \"In that \
case,\" said he, \"'Your bed is on the flinty rock, Your sleep to watch \
alway;' and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of \
sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a single \
night.\" So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who got \
down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken his fast all \
day), and then charged the host to take great care of his horse, as he was \
the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. The landlord eyed \
him over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote said, nor even half as \
good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to see what might be \
wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this time made their peace \
with him, were now relieving of his armour. They had taken off his \
breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his \
gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it with green \
ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut. This, \
however, he would not by any means consent to, so he remained all the evening \
with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that can be imagined; and \
while they were removing his armour, taking the baggages who were about it \
for ladies of high degree belonging to the castle, he said to them with great \
sprightliness: \"Oh, never, surely, was there knight So served by hand of \
dame, As served was he, Don Quixote hight, When from his town he came; With \
maidens waiting on himself, Princesses on his hack-- or Rocinante, for that, \
ladies mine, is my horse's name, and Don Quixote of La Mancha is my own; for \
though I had no intention of declaring myself until my achievements in your \
service and honour had made me known, the necessity of adapting that old \
ballad of Lancelot to the present occasion has given you the knowledge of my \
name altogether prematurely. A time, however, will come for your ladyships to \
command and me to obey, and then the might of my arm will show my desire to \
serve you.\" The girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, \
had nothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to \
eat. \"I would gladly eat a bit of something,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I \
feel it would come very seasonably.\" The day happened to be a Friday, and in \
the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call in \
Castile \"abadejo,\" in Andalusia \"bacallao,\" and in some places \
\"curadillo,\" and in others \"troutlet;\" so they asked him if he thought he \
could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. \"If there be \
troutlets enough,\" said Don Quixote, \"they will be the same thing as a \
trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight reals in small change \
or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that these troutlets are like veal, \
which is better than beef, or kid, which is better than goat. But whatever it \
be let it come quickly, for the burden and pressure of arms cannot be borne \
without support to the inside.\" They laid a table for him at the door of the \
inn for the sake of the air, and the host brought him a portion of ill-soaked \
and worse cooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his \
own armour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating, for having his \
helmet on and the beaver up, he could not with his own hands put anything \
into his mouth unless some one else placed it there, and this service one of \
the ladies rendered him. But to give him anything to drink was impossible, or \
would have been so had not the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in \
his mouth poured the wine into him through the other; all which he bore with \
patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet. While this was going on \
there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he approached, sounded his reed \
pipe four or five times, and thereby completely convinced Don Quixote that he \
was in some famous castle, and that they were regaling him with music, and \
that the stockfish was trout, the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and \
the landlord the castellan of the castle; and consequently he held that his \
enterprise and sally had been to some purpose. But still it distressed him to \
think he had not been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could not \
lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood. \
CHAPTER III. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD \
HIMSELF DUBBED A KNIGHT Harassed by this reflection, he made haste with his \
scanty pothouse supper, and having finished it called the landlord, and \
shutting himself into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, \
saying, \"From this spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy \
grants me the boon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and the \
benefit of the human race.\" The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and \
hearing a speech of this kind, stood staring at him in bewilderment, not \
knowing what to do or say, and entreating him to rise, but all to no purpose \
until he had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him. \"I looked for no \
less, my lord, from your High Magnificence,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and I \
have to tell you that the boon I have asked and your liberality has granted \
is that you shall dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall \
watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle; thus tomorrow, as I have \
said, will be accomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to \
roam through all the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalf \
of those in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errant like \
myself, whose ambition is directed to such deeds.\" The landlord, who, as has \
been mentioned, was something of a wag, and had already some suspicion of his \
guest's want of wits, was quite convinced of it on hearing talk of this kind \
from him, and to make sport for the night he determined to fall in with his \
humour. So he told him he was quite right in pursuing the object he had in \
view, and that such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers as \
distinguished as he seemed and his gallant bearing showed him to be; and that \
he himself in his younger days had followed the same honourable calling, \
roaming in quest of adventures in various parts of the world, among others \
the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, \
the Little Market of Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of \
Granada, the Strand of San Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, \
and divers other quarters, where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and \
the lightness of his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, \
ruining maids and swindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the \
notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last \
he had retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon his property \
and upon that of others; and where he received all knights-errant of whatever \
rank or condition they might be, all for the great love he bore them and that \
they might share their substance with him in return for his benevolence. He \
told him, moreover, that in this castle of his there was no chapel in which \
he could watch his armour, as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, \
but that in a case of necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and \
he might watch it that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the \
morning, God willing, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to \
have him dubbed a knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more \
so. He asked if he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote replied that \
he had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he had never \
read of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord told him he was \
mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories, because in the author's \
opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and necessary as \
money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore that they did not \
carry them, and he might regard it as certain and established that all \
knights-errant (about whom there were so many full and unimpeachable books) \
carried well-furnished purses in case of emergency, and likewise carried \
shirts and a little box of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in \
those plains and deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, \
it was not always that there was some one to cure them, unless indeed they \
had for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetching \
through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of \
such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of their hurts and \
wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had not received any damage \
whatever. But in case this should not occur, the knights of old took care to \
see that their squires were provided with money and other requisites, such as \
lint and ointments for healing purposes; and when it happened that knights \
had no squires (which was rarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried \
everything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse's croup, \
as if it were something else of more importance, because, unless for some \
such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regarded among \
knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson so soon to be, \
he might even command him) never from that time forth to travel without money \
and the usual requirements, and he would find the advantage of them when he \
least expected it. Don Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, \
and it was arranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard \
at one side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it \
on a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his \
arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and down in \
front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to fall. The \
landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of his \
guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he contemplated. \
Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they flocked to see it from a \
distance, and observed with what composure he sometimes paced up and down, or \
sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on his armour without taking his eyes \
off it for ever so long; and as the night closed in with a light from the \
moon so brilliant that it might vie with his that lent it, everything the \
novice knight did was plainly seen by all. Meanwhile one of the carriers who \
were in the inn thought fit to water his team, and it was necessary to remove \
Don Quixote's armour as it lay on the trough; but he seeing the other \
approach hailed him in a loud voice, \"O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight \
that comest to lay hands on the armour of the most valorous errant that ever \
girt on sword, have a care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst \
lay down thy life as the penalty of thy rashness.\" The carrier gave no heed \
to these words (and he would have done better to heed them if he had been \
heedful of his health), but seizing it by the straps flung the armour some \
distance from him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and \
fixing his thoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, \"Aid me, \
lady mine, in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast \
which thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail me \
in this first jeopardy;\" and, with these words and others to the same \
purpose, dropping his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and with it \
smote such a blow on the carrier's head that he stretched him on the ground, \
so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there would have been no \
need of a surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and \
returned to his beat with the same serenity as before. Shortly after this, \
another, not knowing what had happened (for the carrier still lay senseless), \
came with the same object of giving water to his mules, and was proceeding to \
remove the armour in order to clear the trough, when Don Quixote, without \
uttering a word or imploring aid from anyone, once more dropped his buckler \
and once more lifted his lance, and without actually breaking the second \
carrier's head into pieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open \
in four. At the noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among \
them the landlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, \
and with his hand on his sword exclaimed, \"O Lady of Beauty, strength and \
support of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy \
greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an \
adventure.\" By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have \
flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. The comrades of \
the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance to \
shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best he could with his \
buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour unprotected. The \
landlord shouted to them to leave him alone, for he had already told them \
that he was mad, and as a madman he would not be accountable even if he \
killed them all. Still louder shouted Don Quixote, calling them knaves and \
traitors, and the lord of the castle, who allowed knights-errant to be \
treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born knight whom, had he \
received the order of knighthood, he would call to account for his treachery. \
\"But of you,\" he cried, \"base and vile rabble, I make no account; fling, \
strike, come on, do all ye can against me, ye shall see what the reward of \
your folly and insolence will be.\" This he uttered with so much spirit and \
boldness that he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much for \
this reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning him, \
and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same calmness and \
composure as before resumed the watch over his armour. But these freaks of \
his guest were not much to the liking of the landlord, so he determined to \
cut matters short and confer upon him at once the unlucky order of knighthood \
before any further misadventure could occur; so, going up to him, he \
apologised for the rudeness which, without his knowledge, had been offered to \
him by these low people, who, however, had been well punished for their \
audacity. As he had already told him, he said, there was no chapel in the \
castle, nor was it needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood \
the ceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in \
the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered \
in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to \
watching the armour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two \
hours only, while he had been more than four about it. Don Quixote believed \
it all, and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of \
it with as much despatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, and \
felt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul \
alive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his \
bidding. Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book \
in which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the carriers, \
and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels already mentioned, \
he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him kneel down. Then, \
reading from his account-book as if he were repeating some devout prayer, in \
the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and gave him a sturdy blow on \
the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart slap on the shoulder, all the \
while muttering between his teeth as if he was saying his prayers. Having \
done this, he directed one of the ladies to gird on his sword, which she did \
with great self-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to \
prevent a burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had \
already seen of the novice knight's prowess kept their laughter within \
bounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, \"May God \
make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success in battle.\" \
Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that time forward know \
to whom he was beholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer \
upon her some portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm. She \
answered with great humility that she was called La Tolosa, and that she was \
the daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, \
and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. \
Don Quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she \
assumed the \"Don\" and called herself Dona Tolosa. She promised she would, \
and then the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost the same \
conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, and she said \
it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of a respectable miller of \
Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote requested that she would adopt the \
\"Don\" and call herself Dona Molinera, making offers to her further services \
and favours. Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion \
these never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw \
himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling \
Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned thanks \
for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language so \
extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it. The \
landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric though \
with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay the reckoning let him \
go with a Godspeed. CHAPTER IV. OF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT \
THE INN Day was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, \
so exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was like \
to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his host as to \
the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring to money \
and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with all, and also \
with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a farm-labourer, a neighbour of \
his, a poor man with a family, but very well qualified for the office of \
squire to a knight. With this object he turned his horse's head towards his \
village, and Rocinante, thus reminded of his old quarters, stepped out so \
briskly that he hardly seemed to tread the earth. He had not gone far, when \
out of a thicket on his right there seemed to come feeble cries as of some \
one in distress, and the instant he heard them he exclaimed, \"Thanks be to \
heaven for the favour it accords me, that it so soon offers me an opportunity \
of fulfilling the obligation I have undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my \
ambition. These cries, no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, \
and needing my aid and protection;\" and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the \
direction whence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces \
into the wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and \
stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age, from \
whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer was \
flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings and \
commands, repeating, \"Your mouth shut and your eyes open!\" while the youth \
made answer, \"I won't do it again, master mine; by God's passion I won't do \
it again, and I'll take more care of the flock another time.\" Seeing what \
was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice, \"Discourteous knight, it \
ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend himself; mount your steed and \
take your lance\" (for there was a lance leaning against the oak to which the \
mare was tied), \"and I will make you know that you are behaving as a coward.\
\" The farmer, seeing before him this figure in full armour brandishing a \
lance over his head, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, \"Sir \
Knight, this youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to \
watch a flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose \
one every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says \
I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and \
before God, and on my soul, he lies.\" \"Lies before me, base clown!\" said \
Don Quixote. \"By the sun that shines on us I have a mind to run you through \
with this lance. Pay him at once without another word; if not, by the God \
that rules us I will make an end of you, and annihilate you on the spot; \
release him instantly.\" The farmer hung his head, and without a word untied \
his servant, of whom Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him. He \
replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up, found \
that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay it down \
immediately, if he did not want to die for it. The trembling clown replied \
that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn (though he had not sworn any) \
it was not so much; for there were to be taken into account and deducted \
three pairs of shoes he had given him, and a real for two blood-lettings when \
he was sick. \"All that is very well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but let the shoes \
and the blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him \
without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid for, \
you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from him when \
he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on that score he owes \
you nothing.\" \"The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; \
let Andres come home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.\" \"I go \
with him!\" said the youth. \"Nay, God forbid! No, senor, not for the world; \
for once alone with me, he would ray me like a Saint Bartholomew.\" \"He will \
do nothing of the kind,\" said Don Quixote; \"I have only to command, and he \
will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of knighthood which he \
has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the payment.\" \"Consider \
what you are saying, senor,\" said the youth; \"this master of mine is not a \
knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for he is Juan Haldudo \
the Rich, of Quintanar.\" \"That matters little,\" replied Don Quixote; \
\"there may be Haldudos knights; moreover, everyone is the son of his \
works.\" \"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but this master of mine--of what \
works is he the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?\" \
\"I do not refuse, brother Andres,\" said the farmer, \"be good enough to \
come along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there are in \
the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed.\" \"For \
the perfumery I excuse you,\" said Don Quixote; \"give it to him in reals, \
and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn; if not, by \
the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish you; and I \
shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. And if you desire \
to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you be more firmly bound \
to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer \
of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you, and keep in mind what you \
have promised and sworn under those penalties that have been already declared \
to you.\" So saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. \
The farmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared \
the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said, \
\"Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of \
wrongs has commanded me.\" \"My oath on it,\" said Andres, \"your worship \
will be well advised to obey the command of that good knight--may he live a \
thousand years--for, as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do \
not pay me, he will come back and do as he said.\" \"My oath on it, too,\" \
said the farmer; \"but as I have a strong affection for you, I want to add to \
the debt in order to add to the payment;\" and seizing him by the arm, he \
tied him up again, and gave him such a flogging that he left him for dead. \
\"Now, Master Andres,\" said the farmer, \"call on the undoer of wrongs; you \
will find he won't undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite done \
with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.\" But at last he untied \
him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence \
pronounced into execution. Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing \
he would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him \
exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be repaid him \
sevenfold; but for all that, he went off weeping, while his master stood \
laughing. Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly \
satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a very \
happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road towards his \
village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, \"Well mayest thou \
this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, \
fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to hold subject and \
submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned as is and will \
be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as all the world knows, yesterday received \
the order of knighthood, and hath to-day righted the greatest wrong and \
grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath \
to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly \
lashing that tender child.\" He now came to a road branching in four \
directions, and immediately he was reminded of those cross-roads where \
knights-errant used to stop to consider which road they should take. In \
imitation of them he halted for a while, and after having deeply considered \
it, he gave Rocinante his head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, \
who followed out his first intention, which was to make straight for his own \
stable. After he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party \
of people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their \
way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their \
sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot. Scarcely \
had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that this must be \
some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he could those \
passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one made on \
purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing and \
determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance ready, \
brought his buckler before his breast, and planting himself in the middle of \
the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant, for such he now \
considered and held them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and \
hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, \"All the world stand, unless all \
the world confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the \
Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\" The traders halted \
at the sound of this language and the sight of the strange figure that \
uttered it, and from both figure and language at once guessed the craze of \
their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly what was the object of \
this confession that was demanded of them, and one of them, who was rather \
fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to him, \"Sir Knight, we do \
not know who this good lady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she \
be of such beauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any \
pressure we will confess the truth that is on your part required of us.\" \
\"If I were to show her to you,\" replied Don Quixote, \"what merit would you \
have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that without \
seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend it; else ye \
have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant rabble that ye are; \
and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood requires, or all \
together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed, here do I bide and \
await you relying on the justice of the cause I maintain.\" \"Sir Knight,\" \
replied the trader, \"I entreat your worship in the name of this present \
company of princes, that, to save us from charging our consciences with the \
confession of a thing we have never seen or heard of, and one moreover so \
much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens of the Alcarria and \
Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us some portrait of this \
lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat; for by the thread one \
gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be satisfied and easy, and you \
will be content and pleased; nay, I believe we are already so far agreed with \
you that even though her portrait should show her blind of one eye, and \
distilling vermilion and sulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to \
gratify your worship, say all in her favour that you desire.\" \"She distils \
nothing of the kind, vile rabble,\" said Don Quixote, burning with rage, \
\"nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and civet in cotton; nor is she \
one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a Guadarrama spindle: but ye must \
pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered against beauty like that of my lady.\" \
And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had spoken, \
with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived that Rocinante \
should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone hard with the rash \
trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his master, rolling along the \
ground for some distance; and when he tried to rise he was unable, so \
encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and the weight of his \
old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get up he kept saying, \
\"Fly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by my fault, but my horse's, \
am I stretched here.\" One of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have \
had much good nature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in \
this style, was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and \
coming up to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with \
one of them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and \
in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. His masters \
called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but the muleteers \
blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game until he had vented the \
rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remaining fragments of the lance he \
finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim, who all through the storm \
of sticks that rained on him never ceased threatening heaven, and earth, and \
the brigands, for such they seemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, \
and the traders continued their journey, taking with them matter for talk \
about the poor fellow who had been cudgelled. He when he found himself alone \
made another effort to rise; but if he was unable when whole and sound, how \
was he to rise after having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? \
And yet he esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to him that this was a \
regular knight-errant's mishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his \
horse. However, battered in body as he was, to rise was beyond his power. \
CHAPTER V. IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT'S MISHAP IS CONTINUED \
Finding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of having \
recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passage in his \
books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin and the Marquis \
of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the mountain side, a story known \
by heart by the children, not forgotten by the young men, and lauded and even \
believed by the old folk; and for all that not a whit truer than the miracles \
of Mahomet. This seemed to him to fit exactly the case in which he found \
himself, so, making a show of severe suffering, he began to roll on the \
ground and with feeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight \
of the wood is said to have uttered: Where art thou, lady mine, that thou My \
sorrow dost not rue? Thou canst not know it, lady mine, Or else thou art \
untrue. And so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines: O noble \
Marquis of Mantua, My Uncle and liege lord! As chance would have it, when he \
had got to this line there happened to come by a peasant from his own \
village, a neighbour of his, who had been with a load of wheat to the mill, \
and he, seeing the man stretched there, came up to him and asked him who he \
was and what was the matter with him that he complained so dolefully. Don \
Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his uncle, \
so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in which he told the \
tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor's son and his wife \
all exactly as the ballad sings it. The peasant stood amazed at hearing such \
nonsense, and relieving him of the visor, already battered to pieces by \
blows, he wiped his face, which was covered with dust, and as soon as he had \
done so he recognised him and said, \"Senor Quixada\" (for so he appears to \
have been called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from a \
quiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), \"who has brought your worship \
to this pass?\" But to all questions the other only went on with his ballad. \
Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and \
backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood nor any \
mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the ground, and with no \
little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him to be the \
easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms, even to the splinters of the \
lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and leading him by the bridle and the ass \
by the halter he took the road for the village, very sad to hear what absurd \
stuff Don Quixote was talking. Nor was Don Quixote less so, for what with \
blows and bruises he could not sit upright on the ass, and from time to time \
he sent up sighs to heaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask \
what ailed him. And it could have been only the devil himself that put into \
his head tales to match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he \
bethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, \
Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him away to his castle; so \
that when the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed him, he gave \
him for reply the same words and phrases that the captive Abindarraez gave to \
Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had read the story in the \"Diana\" of Jorge \
de Montemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case so aptly that \
the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot \
of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the conclusion that his \
neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the \
wearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote's; who, at the end of it, said, \
\"Senor Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa \
I have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I have done, \
am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in this world \
have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.\" To this the peasant \
answered, \"Senor--sinner that I am!--cannot your worship see that I am not \
Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of Mantua, but Pedro Alonso your \
neighbour, and that your worship is neither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the \
worthy gentleman Senor Quixada?\" \"I know who I am,\" replied Don Quixote, \
\"and I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the Twelve \
Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass \
all that they have done all together and each of them on his own account.\" \
With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as \
night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a little \
later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a \
miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time he entered the \
village and went to Don Quixote's house, which he found all in confusion, and \
there were the curate and the village barber, who were great friends of Don \
Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to them in a loud voice, \"What does \
your worship think can have befallen my master, Senor Licentiate Pero \
Perez?\" for so the curate was called; \"it is three days now since anything \
has been seen of him, or the hack, or the buckler, lance, or armour. \
Miserable me! I am certain of it, and it is as true as that I was born to \
die, that these accursed books of chivalry he has, and has got into the way \
of reading so constantly, have upset his reason; for now I remember having \
often heard him saying to himself that he would turn knight-errant and go all \
over the world in quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such \
books, that have brought to ruin in this way the finest understanding there \
was in all La Mancha!\" The niece said the same, and, more: \"You must know, \
Master Nicholas\"--for that was the name of the barber--\"it was often my \
uncle's way to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy \
books of misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up \
his sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he would \
say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat that flowed \
from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had \
received in battle; and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and \
become calm and quiet, saying that this water was a most precious potion \
which the sage Esquife, a great magician and friend of his, had brought him. \
But I take all the blame upon myself for never having told your worships of \
my uncle's vagaries, that you might put a stop to them before things had come \
to this pass, and burn all these accursed books--for he has a great \
number--that richly deserve to be burned like heretics.\" \"So say I too,\" \
said the curate, \"and by my faith to-morrow shall not pass without public \
judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to the flames lest they lead \
those that read to behave as my good friend seems to have behaved.\" All this \
the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was the matter with \
his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, \"Open, your worships, to Senor \
Baldwin and to Senor the Marquis of Mantua, who comes badly wounded, and to \
Senor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the valiant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide \
of Antequera, brings captive.\" At these words they all hurried out, and when \
they recognised their friend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted \
from the ass because he could not, they ran to embrace him. \"Hold!\" said \
he, \"for I am badly wounded through my horse's fault; carry me to bed, and \
if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and see to my wounds.\" \"See \
there! plague on it!\" cried the housekeeper at this: \"did not my heart tell \
the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed with your worship \
at once, and we will contrive to cure you here without fetching that Hurgada. \
A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more, on those books of chivalry \
that have brought your worship to such a pass.\" They carried him to bed at \
once, and after searching for his wounds could find none, but he said they \
were all bruises from having had a severe fall with his horse Rocinante when \
in combat with ten giants, the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth. \
\"So, so!\" said the curate, \"are there giants in the dance? By the sign of \
the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day over.\" They put a host \
of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all was--give him \
something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was what he needed most. \
They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at great length as to how \
he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the nonsense he had talked when \
found and on the way home, all which made the licentiate the more eager to do \
what he did the next day, which was to summon his friend the barber, Master \
Nicholas, and go with him to Don Quixote's house. CHAPTER VI. OF THE \
DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER MADE IN THE \
LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN He was still sleeping; so the curate asked \
the niece for the keys of the room where the books, the authors of all the \
mischief, were, and right willingly she gave them. They all went in, the \
housekeeper with them, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books \
very well bound, and some other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw \
them she turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediately with \
a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, \"Here, your worship, senor \
licentiate, sprinkle this room; don't leave any magician of the many there \
are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them \
from the world.\" The simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate \
laugh, and he directed the barber to give him the books one by one to see \
what they were about, as there might be some to be found among them that did \
not deserve the penalty of fire. \"No,\" said the niece, \"there is no reason \
for showing mercy to any of them; they have every one of them done mischief; \
better fling them out of the window into the court and make a pile of them \
and set fire to them; or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire \
can be made without the smoke giving any annoyance.\" The housekeeper said \
the same, so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but \
the curate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate the \
titles. The first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was \"The four books \
of Amadis of Gaul.\" \"This seems a mysterious thing,\" said the curate, \
\"for, as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed in \
Spain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin; so it \
seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames as the \
founder of so vile a sect.\" \"Nay, sir,\" said the barber, \"I too, have \
heard say that this is the best of all the books of this kind that have been \
written, and so, as something singular in its line, it ought to be \
pardoned.\" \"True,\" said the curate; \"and for that reason let its life be \
spared for the present. Let us see that other which is next to it.\" \"It is,\
\" said the barber, \"the 'Sergas de Esplandian,' the lawful son of Amadis of \
Gaul.\" \"Then verily,\" said the curate, \"the merit of the father must not \
be put down to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; open \
the window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for \
the bonfire we are to make.\" The housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, \
and the worthy \"Esplandian\" went flying into the yard to await with all \
patience the fire that was in store for him. \"Proceed,\" said the curate. \
\"This that comes next,\" said the barber, \"is 'Amadis of Greece,' and, \
indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis lineage.\" \
\"Then to the yard with the whole of them,\" said the curate; \"for to have \
the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and his \
eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author, I would \
burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about in the guise of \
a knight-errant.\" \"I am of the same mind,\" said the barber. \"And so am I,\
\" added the niece. \"In that case,\" said the housekeeper, \"here, into the \
yard with them!\" They were handed to her, and as there were many of them, \
she spared herself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window. \
\"Who is that tub there?\" said the curate. \"This,\" said the barber, \"is \
'Don Olivante de Laura.'\" \"The author of that book,\" said the curate, \
\"was the same that wrote 'The Garden of Flowers,' and truly there is no \
deciding which of the two books is the more truthful, or, to put it better, \
the less lying; all I can say is, send this one into the yard for a \
swaggering fool.\" \"This that follows is 'Florismarte of Hircania,'\" said \
the barber. \"Senor Florismarte here?\" said the curate; \"then by my faith \
he must take up his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth \
and visionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style deserve \
nothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistress housekeeper.\" \
\"With all my heart, senor,\" said she, and executed the order with great \
delight. \"This,\" said the barber, \"is The Knight Platir.'\" \"An old book \
that,\" said the curate, \"but I find no reason for clemency in it; send it \
after the others without appeal;\" which was done. Another book was opened, \
and they saw it was entitled, \"The Knight of the Cross.\" \"For the sake of \
the holy name this book has,\" said the curate, \"its ignorance might be \
excused; but then, they say, 'behind the cross there's the devil; to the fire \
with it.\" Taking down another book, the barber said, \"This is 'The Mirror \
of Chivalry.'\" \"I know his worship,\" said the curate; \"that is where \
Senor Reinaldos of Montalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater \
thieves than Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious \
historian Turpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than \
perpetual banishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the \
invention of the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet \
Ludovico Ariosto wove his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any \
language but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he speaks his \
own tongue I will put him upon my head.\" \"Well, I have him in Italian,\" \
said the barber, \"but I do not understand him.\" \"Nor would it be well that \
you should understand him,\" said the curate, \"and on that score we might \
have excused the Captain if he had not brought him into Spain and turned him \
into Castilian. He robbed him of a great deal of his natural force, and so do \
all those who try to turn books written in verse into another language, for, \
with all the pains they take and all the cleverness they show, they never can \
reach the level of the originals as they were first produced. In short, I say \
that this book, and all that may be found treating of those French affairs, \
should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until after more \
consideration it is settled what is to be done with them; excepting always \
one 'Bernardo del Carpio' that is going about, and another called \
'Roncesvalles;' for these, if they come into my hands, shall pass at once \
into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into the fire without any \
reprieve.\" To all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as \
right and proper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith \
and loyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed \
to them. Opening another book he saw it was \"Palmerin de Oliva,\" and beside \
it was another called \"Palmerin of England,\" seeing which the licentiate \
said, \"Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned until no ashes \
even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and preserved as a thing \
that stands alone, and let such another case be made for it as that which \
Alexander found among the spoils of Darius and set aside for the safe keeping \
of the works of the poet Homer. This book, gossip, is of authority for two \
reasons, first because it is very good, and secondly because it is said to \
have been written by a wise and witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at \
the Castle of Miraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the \
language is polished and clear, studying and observing the style befitting \
the speaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good to \
you, Master Nicholas, I say let this and 'Amadis of Gaul' be remitted the \
penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without further \
question or query.\" \"Nay, gossip,\" said the barber, \"for this that I have \
here is the famous 'Don Belianis.'\" \"Well,\" said the curate, \"that and \
the second, third, and fourth parts all stand in need of a little rhubarb to \
purge their excess of bile, and they must be cleared of all that stuff about \
the Castle of Fame and other greater affectations, to which end let them be \
allowed the over-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or \
justice be meted out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them \
in your house and let no one read them.\" \"With all my heart,\" said the \
barber; and not caring to tire himself with reading more books of chivalry, \
he told the housekeeper to take all the big ones and throw them into the \
yard. It was not said to one dull or deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning \
them more than weaving the broadest and finest web that could be; and seizing \
about eight at a time, she flung them out of the window. In carrying so many \
together she let one fall at the feet of the barber, who took it up, curious \
to know whose it was, and found it said, \"History of the Famous Knight, \
Tirante el Blanco.\" \"God bless me!\" said the curate with a shout, \
\"'Tirante el Blanco' here! Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have \
found a treasury of enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don \
Kyrieleison of Montalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of \
Montalvan, and the knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought \
with the mastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the \
loves and wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the \
squire Hipolito--in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best book \
in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds, and make \
their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which there is nothing in \
all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it, for deliberately \
composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the galleys for life. Take \
it home with you and read it, and you will see that what I have said is true.\
\" \"As you will,\" said the barber; \"but what are we to do with these \
little books that are left?\" \"These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,\" \
said the curate; and opening one he saw it was the \"Diana\" of Jorge de \
Montemayor, and, supposing all the others to be of the same sort, \"these,\" \
he said, \"do not deserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do \
nor can do the mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books of \
entertainment that can hurt no one.\" \"Ah, senor!\" said the niece, \"your \
worship had better order these to be burned as well as the others; for it \
would be no wonder if, after being cured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, \
by reading these, took a fancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and \
fields singing and piping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which \
they say is an incurable and infectious malady.\" \"The damsel is right,\" \
said the curate, \"and it will be well to put this stumbling-block and \
temptation out of our friend's way. To begin, then, with the 'Diana' of \
Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be burned, but that it should be \
cleared of all that about the sage Felicia and the magic water, and of almost \
all the longer pieces of verse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the \
honour of being the first of books of the kind.\" \"This that comes next,\" \
said the barber, \"is the 'Diana,' entitled the 'Second Part, by the \
Salamancan,' and this other has the same title, and its author is Gil Polo.\" \
\"As for that of the Salamancan,\" replied the curate, \"let it go to swell \
the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo's be preserved as \
if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and make haste, for it is \
growing late.\" \"This book,\" said the barber, opening another, \"is the ten \
books of the 'Fortune of Love,' written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian \
poet.\" \"By the orders I have received,\" said the curate, \"since Apollo \
has been Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets, so \
droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it is \
the best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet \
appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read what is \
delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more account of having found it \
than if they had given me a cassock of Florence stuff.\" He put it aside with \
extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on, \"These that come next are 'The \
Shepherd of Iberia,' 'Nymphs of Henares,' and 'The Enlightenment of \
Jealousy.'\" \"Then all we have to do,\" said the curate, \"is to hand them \
over to the secular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall \
never have done.\" \"This next is the 'Pastor de Filida.'\" \"No Pastor that,\
\" said the curate, \"but a highly polished courtier; let it be preserved as \
a precious jewel.\" \"This large one here,\" said the barber, \"is called \
'The Treasury of various Poems.'\" \"If there were not so many of them,\" \
said the curate, \"they would be more relished: this book must be weeded and \
cleansed of certain vulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be \
preserved because the author is a friend of mine, and out of respect for \
other more heroic and loftier works that he has written.\" \"This,\" \
continued the barber, \"is the 'Cancionero' of Lopez de Maldonado.\" \"The \
author of that book, too,\" said the curate, \"is a great friend of mine, and \
his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who hear them, for \
such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when he chants them: it \
gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is good was never yet \
plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been set apart. But what book \
is that next it?\" \"The 'Galatea' of Miguel de Cervantes,\" said the barber. \
\"That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my \
knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His book has \
some good invention in it, it presents us with something but brings nothing \
to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it promises: perhaps with \
amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of grace that is now \
denied it; and in the mean time do you, senor gossip, keep it shut up in your \
own quarters.\" \"Very good,\" said the barber; \"and here come three \
together, the 'Araucana' of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the 'Austriada' of Juan \
Rufo, Justice of Cordova, and the 'Montserrate' of Christobal de Virues, the \
Valencian poet.\" \"These three books,\" said the curate, \"are the best that \
have been written in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the \
most famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of \
poetry that Spain possesses.\" The curate was tired and would not look into \
any more books, and so he decided that, \"contents uncertified,\" all the \
rest should be burned; but just then the barber held open one, called \"The \
Tears of Angelica.\" \"I should have shed tears myself,\" said the curate \
when he heard the title, \"had I ordered that book to be burned, for its \
author was one of the famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was \
very happy in the translation of some of Ovid's fables.\" CHAPTER VII. OF THE \
SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA At this instant \
Don Quixote began shouting out, \"Here, here, valiant knights! here is need \
for you to put forth the might of your strong arms, for they of the Court are \
gaining the mastery in the tourney!\" Called away by this noise and outcry, \
they proceeded no farther with the scrutiny of the remaining books, and so it \
is thought that \"The Carolea,\" \"The Lion of Spain,\" and \"The Deeds of \
the Emperor,\" written by Don Luis de Avila, went to the fire unseen and \
unheard; for no doubt they were among those that remained, and perhaps if the \
curate had seen them they would not have undergone so severe a sentence. When \
they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still shouting \
and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake as if he had \
never slept. They closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when \
he had become a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, \"Of a \
truth, Senor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call \
ourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court \
to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having carried off \
the honour on the three former days.\" \"Hush, gossip,\" said the curate; \
\"please God, the luck may turn, and what is lost to-day may be won \
to-morrow; for the present let your worship have a care of your health, for \
it seems to me that you are over-fatigued, if not badly wounded.\" \"Wounded \
no,\" said Don Quixote, \"but bruised and battered no doubt, for that bastard \
Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree, and all for envy, \
because he sees that I alone rival him in his achievements. But I should not \
call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did he not pay me for it in spite of all \
his enchantments as soon as I rise from this bed. For the present let them \
bring me something to eat, for that, I feel, is what will be more to my \
purpose, and leave it to me to avenge myself.\" They did as he wished; they \
gave him something to eat, and once more he fell asleep, leaving them \
marvelling at his madness. That night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the \
books that were in the yard and in the whole house; and some must have been \
consumed that deserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate \
and the laziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was \
verified the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty. One of the \
remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied to their \
friend's disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where the books were, \
so that when he got up he should not find them (possibly the cause being \
removed the effect might cease), and they might say that a magician had \
carried them off, room and all; and this was done with all despatch. Two days \
later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he did was to go and look at \
his books, and not finding the room where he had left it, he wandered from \
side to side looking for it. He came to the place where the door used to be, \
and tried it with his hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every \
direction without saying a word; but after a good while he asked his \
housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held his books. The housekeeper, \
who had been already well instructed in what she was to answer, said, \"What \
room or what nothing is it that your worship is looking for? There are \
neither room nor books in this house now, for the devil himself has carried \
all away.\" \"It was not the devil,\" said the niece, \"but a magician who \
came on a cloud one night after the day your worship left this, and \
dismounting from a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did \
there I know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the \
roof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had \
done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the housekeeper \
and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice that, for a \
private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room, he had done \
mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he said too that \
his name was the Sage Munaton.\" \"He must have said Friston,\" said Don \
Quixote. \"I don't know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,\" said \
the housekeeper, \"I only know that his name ended with 'ton.'\" \"So it \
does,\" said Don Quixote, \"and he is a sage magician, a great enemy of mine, \
who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore that in \
process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight whom he \
befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to prevent it; and \
for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns that he can; but I \
promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what is decreed by \
Heaven.\" \"Who doubts that?\" said the niece; \"but, uncle, who mixes you up \
in these quarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your own \
house instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came of \
wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?\" \"Oh, \
niece of mine,\" replied Don Quixote, \"how much astray art thou in thy \
reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped off the \
beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.\" The two \
were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his anger was \
kindling. In short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly \
without showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, \
and during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the \
curate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant were \
what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be accomplished \
the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes contradicted him, \
sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed this precaution he \
would have been unable to bring him to reason. Meanwhile Don Quixote worked \
upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, an honest man (if indeed that title \
can be given to him who is poor), but with very little wit in his pate. In a \
word, he so talked him over, and with such persuasions and promises, that the \
poor clown made up his mind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. \
Don Quixote, among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him \
gladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island \
in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On these and the \
like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and \
children, and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour. Don Quixote next \
set about getting some money; and selling one thing and pawning another, and \
making a bad bargain in every case, he got together a fair sum. He provided \
himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan from a friend, and, \
restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he warned his squire Sancho \
of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he might provide himself with \
what he thought most needful. Above all, he charged him to take alforjas with \
him. The other said he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass \
he had, as he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote \
hesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind any knight-errant \
taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to \
his memory. For all that, however, he determined to take him, intending to \
furnish him with a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented \
itself, by appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he \
encountered. Himself he provided with shirts and such other things as he \
could, according to the advice the host had given him; all which being done, \
without taking leave, Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote \
of his housekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the \
village one night, and made such good way in the course of it that by \
daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even should search be made \
for them. Sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and \
bota, and longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had \
promised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he had \
taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he \
travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was \
early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat did \
not distress them. And now said Sancho Panza to his master, \"Your worship \
will take care, Senor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have \
promised me, for be it ever so big I'll be equal to governing it.\" To which \
Don Quixote replied, \"Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza, that it was a \
practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old to make their \
squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and I am determined \
that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a custom; on the \
contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes, and perhaps most \
frequently, waited until their squires were old, and then when they had had \
enough of service and hard days and worse nights, they gave them some title \
or other, of count, or at the most marquis, of some valley or province more \
or less; but if thou livest and I live, it may well be that before six days \
are over, I may have won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, \
which will be just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of \
them. Nor needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to \
the lot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might \
easily give thee even more than I promise thee.\" \"In that case,\" said \
Sancho Panza, \"if I should become a king by one of those miracles your \
worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old woman, would come to be queen \
and my children infantes.\" \"Well, who doubts it?\" said Don Quixote. \"I \
doubt it,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"because for my part I am persuaded that \
though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them would fit \
the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, senor, she is not worth two \
maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that only with God's \
help.\" \"Leave it to God, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"for he will give \
her what suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to \
be content with anything less than being governor of a province.\" \"I will \
not, senor,\" answered Sancho, \"specially as I have a man of such quality \
for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all that will be \
suitable for me and that I can bear.\" CHAPTER VIII. OF THE GOOD FORTUNE \
WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE \
OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY TO BE FITLY RECORDED At this \
point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there are on plain, \
and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire, \"Fortune is \
arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires \
ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or more \
monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in battle \
and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this \
is righteous warfare, and it is God's good service to sweep so evil a breed \
from off the face of the earth.\" \"What giants?\" said Sancho Panza. \"Those \
thou seest there,\" answered his master, \"with the long arms, and some have \
them nearly two leagues long.\" \"Look, your worship,\" said Sancho; \"what \
we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are \
the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go.\" \"It is easy to \
see,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that thou art not used to this business of \
adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of \
this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and unequal \
combat.\" So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the \
cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they \
were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however, was so \
positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor \
perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting, \"Fly \
not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.\" A slight \
breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move, seeing \
which Don Quixote exclaimed, \"Though ye flourish more arms than the giant \
Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.\" So saying, and commending himself with \
all his heart to his lady Dulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a \
peril, with lance in rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at \
Rocinante's fullest gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front \
of him; but as he drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it \
round with such force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it \
horse and rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. \
Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he \
came up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with \
him. \"God bless me!\" said Sancho, \"did I not tell your worship to mind \
what you were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have made \
any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his \
head.\" \"Hush, friend Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"the fortunes of war \
more than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I \
think, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off my \
study and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the \
glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end his \
wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword.\" \"God order it as \
he may,\" said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise got him up again on \
Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then, discussing the late \
adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice, for there, said Don \
Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in abundance and variety, as \
it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, he was much grieved at the loss of \
his lance, and saying so to his squire, he added, \"I remember having read \
how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de Vargas by name, having broken his sword \
in battle, tore from an oak a ponderous bough or branch, and with it did such \
things that day, and pounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of \
Machuca, and he and his descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y \
Machuca. I mention this because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such \
another branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determined and \
resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in \
being found worthy to come and see them, and be an eyewitness of things that \
will with difficulty be believed.\" \"Be that as God will,\" said Sancho, \"I \
believe it all as your worship says it; but straighten yourself a little, for \
you seem all on one side, may be from the shaking of the fall.\" \"That is \
the truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"and if I make no complaint of the pain it is \
because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of any wound, even \
though their bowels be coming out through it.\" \"If so,\" said Sancho, \"I \
have nothing to say; but God knows I would rather your worship complained \
when anything ailed you. For my part, I confess I must complain however small \
the ache may be; unless this rule about not complaining extends to the \
squires of knights-errant also.\" Don Quixote could not help laughing at his \
squire's simplicity, and he assured him he might complain whenever and \
however he chose, just as he liked, for, so far, he had never read of \
anything to the contrary in the order of knighthood. Sancho bade him remember \
it was dinner-time, to which his master answered that he wanted nothing \
himself just then, but that he might eat when he had a mind. With this \
permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably as he could on his beast, \
and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed away in them, he jogged \
along behind his master munching deliberately, and from time to time taking a \
pull at the bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might \
have envied; and while he went on in this way, gulping down draught after \
draught, he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made \
him, nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest \
of adventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed the night \
among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve \
him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from \
the broken one. All that night Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his lady \
Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had read in his books, how many a \
night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless supported by \
the memory of their mistresses. Not so did Sancho Panza spend it, for having \
his stomach full of something stronger than chicory water he made but one \
sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him, neither the rays of the \
sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the \
approach of day would have had power to waken him. On getting up he tried the \
bota and found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grieved his \
heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the deficiency \
readily. Don Quixote did not care to break his fast, for, as has been already \
said, he confined himself to savoury recollections for nourishment. They \
returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto Lapice, and at \
three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. \"Here, brother Sancho \
Panza,\" said Don Quixote when he saw it, \"we may plunge our hands up to the \
elbows in what they call adventures; but observe, even shouldst thou see me \
in the greatest danger in the world, thou must not put a hand to thy sword in \
my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest that those who assail me are rabble \
or base folk; for in that case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they \
be knights it is on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of \
knighthood to help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.\" \"Most \
certainly, senor,\" replied Sancho, \"your worship shall be fully obeyed in \
this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no friend to mixing \
in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the defence of my own \
person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for laws human and divine \
allow each one to defend himself against any assailant whatever.\" \"That I \
grant,\" said Don Quixote, \"but in this matter of aiding me against knights \
thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity.\" \"I will do so, I \
promise you,\" answered Sancho, \"and will keep this precept as carefully as \
Sunday.\" While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars \
of the order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less tall \
were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles and carried \
sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons on \
horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there was, as afterwards \
appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where her husband was about to \
take passage for the Indies with an appointment of high honour. The friars, \
though going the same road, were not in her company; but the moment Don \
Quixote perceived them he said to his squire, \"Either I am mistaken, or this \
is going to be the most famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those \
black bodies we see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are \
carrying off some stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must \
undo this wrong.\" \"This will be worse than the windmills,\" said Sancho. \
\"Look, senor; those are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly \
belongs to some travellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and \
don't let the devil mislead you.\" \"I have told thee already, Sancho,\" \
replied Don Quixote, \"that on the subject of adventures thou knowest little. \
What I say is the truth, as thou shalt see presently.\" So saying, he \
advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along which the friars \
were coming, and as soon as he thought they had come near enough to hear what \
he said, he cried aloud, \"Devilish and unnatural beings, release instantly \
the highborn princesses whom you are carrying off by force in this coach, \
else prepare to meet a speedy death as the just punishment of your evil \
deeds.\" The friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don \
Quixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, \"Senor Caballero, we \
are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict following our \
road, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses coming \
in this coach.\" \"No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,\" \
said Don Quixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and \
with levelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, \
that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought \
him to the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright. \
The second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels into \
his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the wind. \
Sancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly from \
his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At that instant \
the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him for. Sancho \
answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the battle which his \
lord Don Quixote had won. The muleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did \
not understand all this about battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was \
some distance off talking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, \
knocked him down, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with \
kicks and left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and \
without any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, \
and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurred after his \
companion, who was standing at a distance looking on, watching the result of \
the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, \
they pursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil \
after them. Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the \
coach: \"Your beauty, lady mine,\" said he, \"may now dispose of your person \
as may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your \
ravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and \
lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that I am \
called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and captive to \
the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in return for the \
service you have received of me I ask no more than that you should return to \
El Toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her \
what I have done to set you free.\" One of the squires in attendance upon the \
coach, a Biscayan, was listening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, \
perceiving that he would not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must \
return at once to El Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed \
him in bad Castilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, \"Begone, \
caballero, and ill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou \
quittest coach, slayest thee as art here a Biscayan.\" Don Quixote understood \
him quite well, and answered him very quietly, \"If thou wert a knight, as \
thou art none, I should have already chastised thy folly and rashness, \
miserable creature.\" To which the Biscayan returned, \"I no gentleman!--I \
swear to God thou liest as I am Christian: if thou droppest lance and drawest \
sword, soon shalt thou see thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on \
land, hidalgo at sea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou sayest \
otherwise thou liest.\" \"'\"You will see presently,\" said Agrajes,'\" \
replied Don Quixote; and throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, \
braced his buckler on his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking \
his life. The Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to \
dismount from his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for \
hire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky \
for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to \
snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at one another \
as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove to make peace \
between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in his disjointed \
phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he would kill his \
mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The lady in the coach, \
amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the coachman to draw aside a \
little, and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in the course of which \
the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top \
of his buckler, which, given to one without armour, would have cleft him to \
the waist. Don Quixote, feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried \
aloud, saying, \"O lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the \
aid of this your knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, \
finds himself in this extreme peril.\" To say this, to lift his sword, to \
shelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was the \
work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon a single blow. \
The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, was convinced of his courage by \
his spirited bearing, and resolved to follow his example, so he waited for \
him keeping well under cover of his cushion, being unable to execute any sort \
of manoeuvre with his mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind \
of game, could not stir a step. On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote \
against the wary Biscayan, with uplifted sword and a firm intention of \
splitting him in half, while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in \
hand, and under the protection of his cushion; and all present stood \
trembling, waiting in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to \
fall, and the lady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a \
thousand vows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God \
might deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which they \
found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis the author \
of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as excuse that he could \
find nothing more written about these achievements of Don Quixote than what \
has been already set forth. It is true the second author of this work was \
unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to \
fall under the sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of La Mancha could have \
been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries some \
documents referring to this famous knight; and this being his persuasion, he \
did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, \
heaven favouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the \
Second Part. CHAPTER IX. IN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC \
BATTLE BETWEEN THE GALLANT BISCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGAN In the First \
Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the renowned Don \
Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two such furious \
slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they would at least have \
split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them open like a \
pomegranate; and at this so critical point the delightful history came to a \
stop and stood cut short without any intimation from the author where what \
was missing was to be found. This distressed me greatly, because the pleasure \
derived from having read such a small portion turned to vexation at the \
thought of the poor chance that presented itself of finding the large part \
that, so it seemed to me, was missing of such an interesting tale. It \
appeared to me to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so \
good a knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task of \
writing his marvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting to any of \
those knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for every one of \
them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only recorded their \
deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies, however secret \
they might be; and such a good knight could not have been so unfortunate as \
not to have what Platir and others like him had in abundance. And so I could \
not bring myself to believe that such a gallant tale had been left maimed and \
mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time, the devourer and destroyer of all \
things, that had either concealed or consumed it. On the other hand, it \
struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there had been found such modern \
ones as \"The Enlightenment of Jealousy\" and the \"Nymphs and Shepherds of \
Henares,\" his story must likewise be modern, and that though it might not be \
written, it might exist in the memory of the people of his village and of \
those in the neighbourhood. This reflection kept me perplexed and longing to \
know really and truly the whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous \
Spaniard, Don Quixote of La Mancha, light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry, \
and the first that in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to \
the labour and exercise of the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs, \
succouring widows, and protecting damsels of that sort that used to ride \
about, whip in hand, on their palfreys, with all their virginity about them, \
from mountain to mountain and valley to valley--for, if it were not for some \
ruffian, or boor with a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced \
them, there were in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years, in \
all which time they had never slept a day under a roof, went to their graves \
as much maids as the mothers that bore them. I say, then, that in these and \
other respects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable \
praise, nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains spent \
in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I know \
well that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, the world \
would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure that for a \
couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it attentively. The \
discovery of it occurred in this way. One day, as I was in the Alcana of \
Toledo, a boy came up to sell some pamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, \
and, as I am fond of reading even the very scraps of paper in the streets, \
led by this natural bent of mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had \
for sale, and saw that it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and \
as I was unable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to \
see if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me; \
nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even \
had I sought one for an older and better language I should have found him. In \
short, chance provided me with one, who when I told him what I wanted and put \
the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a little \
in it began to laugh. I asked him what he was laughing at, and he replied \
that it was at something the book had written in the margin by way of a note. \
I bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, \"In the margin, as I \
told you, this is written: 'This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in \
this history, had, they say, the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for \
salting pigs.'\" When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with \
surprise and amazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets \
contained the history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read \
the beginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he \
told me it meant, \"History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cide \
Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian.\" It required great caution to hide the \
joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatching it from \
the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets from the boy for half \
a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had known how eager I was \
for them, he might have safely calculated on making more than six reals by \
the bargain. I withdrew at once with the Morisco into the cloister of the \
cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don \
Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to \
them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with two \
arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them \
faithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, and not to \
let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to my house, where in \
little more than a month and a half he translated the whole just as it is set \
down here. In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the \
Biscayan was drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the \
history describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, \
the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan's mule so true to nature that it \
could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The Biscayan had an \
inscription under his feet which said, \"Don Sancho de Azpeitia,\" which no \
doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of Rocinante was another that \
said, \"Don Quixote.\" Rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long and \
thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in consumption, \
that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante \
had been bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of \
his ass, at whose feet was another label that said, \"Sancho Zancas,\" and \
according to the picture, he must have had a big belly, a short body, and \
long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza and Zancas were \
given him, for by these two surnames the history several times calls him. \
Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned, but they are all of \
slight importance and have nothing to do with the true relation of the \
history; and no history can be bad so long as it is true. If against the \
present one any objection be raised on the score of its truth, it can only be \
that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very common propensity with those \
of that nation; though, as they are such enemies of ours, it is conceivable \
that there were omissions rather than additions made in the course of it. And \
this is my own opinion; for, where he could and should give freedom to his \
pen in praise of so worthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it \
over in silence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the \
business and duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from \
passion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them \
swerve from the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, \
storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel for the \
present, and warning for the future. In this I know will be found all that \
can be desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting in any good quality, \
I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault of the \
subject. To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation, began in \
this way: With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as \
though the two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and \
earth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear \
themselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was \
delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its \
course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the bitter \
struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good fortune which \
reserved him for greater things, turned aside the sword of his adversary, so \
that although it smote him upon the left shoulder, it did him no more harm \
than to strip all that side of its armour, carrying away a great part of his \
helmet with half of his ear, all which with fearful ruin fell to the ground, \
leaving him in a sorry plight. Good God! Who is there that could properly \
describe the rage that filled the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself \
dealt with in this fashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he \
again raised himself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly \
with both hands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him \
full over the cushion and over the head, that--even so good a shield proving \
useless--as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from nose, \
mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule, as no \
doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at the \
same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then \
unclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow, made \
off across the plain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the ground. \
Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he saw him fall, leaped \
from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and, presenting the point \
of his sword to his eyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off. \
The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word, and it \
would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the ladies \
in the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in great terror, \
hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest entreaties to grant \
them the great grace and favour of sparing their squire's life; to which Don \
Quixote replied with much gravity and dignity, \"In truth, fair ladies, I am \
well content to do what ye ask of me; but it must be on one condition and \
understanding, which is that this knight promise me to go to the village of \
El Toboso, and on my behalf present himself before the peerless lady \
Dulcinea, that she deal with him as shall be most pleasing to her.\" The \
terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote's demand or \
asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire should do all that \
had been commanded. \"Then, on the faith of that promise,\" said Don Quixote, \
\"I shall do him no further harm, though he well deserves it of me.\" CHAPTER \
X. OF THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE \
SANCHO PANZA Now by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the \
handling of the friars' muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his \
master, Don Quixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his \
will to grant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to \
make him governor of, as he had promised. Seeing, therefore, that the \
struggle was now over, and that his master was returning to mount Rocinante, \
he approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he could mount, he \
went on his knees before him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying, \"May it \
please your worship, Senor Don Quixote, to give me the government of that \
island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big I feel \
myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as well as \
anyone in the world who has ever governed islands.\" To which Don Quixote \
replied, \"Thou must take notice, brother Sancho, that this adventure and \
those like it are not adventures of islands, but of cross-roads, in which \
nothing is got except a broken head or an ear the less: have patience, for \
adventures will present themselves from which I may make you, not only a \
governor, but something more.\" Sancho gave him many thanks, and again \
kissing his hand and the skirt of his hauberk, helped him to mount Rocinante, \
and mounting his ass himself, proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk \
pace, without taking leave, or saying anything further to the ladies \
belonging to the coach, turned into a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed \
him at his ass's best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself \
left behind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote \
did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching \
him said, \"It seems to me, senor, it would be prudent in us to go and take \
refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has \
been left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the \
Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we come out of \
gaol we shall have to sweat for it.\" \"Peace,\" said Don Quixote; \"where \
hast thou ever seen or heard that a knight-errant has been arraigned before a \
court of justice, however many homicides he may have committed?\" \"I know \
nothing about omecils,\" answered Sancho, \"nor in my life have had anything \
to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks after those who \
fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not meddle.\" \"Then thou \
needst have no uneasiness, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will \
deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out of those of the \
Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou seen a more valiant \
knight than I in all the known world; hast thou read in history of any who \
has or had higher mettle in attack, more spirit in maintaining it, more \
dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing?\" \"The truth is,\" answered \
Sancho, \"that I have never read any history, for I can neither read nor \
write, but what I will venture to bet is that a more daring master than your \
worship I have never served in all the days of my life, and God grant that \
this daring be not paid for where I have said; what I beg of your worship is \
to dress your wound, for a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I \
have here some lint and a little white ointment in the alforjas.\" \"All that \
might be well dispensed with,\" said Don Quixote, \"if I had remembered to \
make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time and medicine are saved by \
one single drop.\" \"What vial and what balsam is that?\" said Sancho Panza. \
\"It is a balsam,\" answered Don Quixote, \"the receipt of which I have in my \
memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of any \
wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to do when \
in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middle of the \
body--as is wont to happen frequently,--but neatly and with great nicety, ere \
the blood congeal, to place that portion of the body which shall have fallen \
to the ground upon the other half which remains in the saddle, taking care to \
fit it on evenly and exactly. Then thou shalt give me to drink but two drops \
of the balsam I have mentioned, and thou shalt see me become sounder than an \
apple.\" \"If that be so,\" said Panza, \"I renounce henceforth the \
government of the promised island, and desire nothing more in payment of my \
many and faithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this \
supreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals an \
ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease and \
honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it.\" \"With less \
than three reals, six quarts of it may be made,\" said Don Quixote. \"Sinner \
that I am!\" said Sancho, \"then why does your worship put off making it and \
teaching it to me?\" \"Peace, friend,\" answered Don Quixote; \"greater \
secrets I mean to teach thee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for \
the present let us see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could \
wish.\" Sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when \
Don Quixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose his senses, \
and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven, be said, \
\"I swear by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in their fullest \
extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua did when he swore to avenge the \
death of his nephew Baldwin (and that was not to eat bread from a \
table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and other points which, though I cannot \
now call them to mind, I here grant as expressed) until I take complete \
vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against me.\" Hearing \
this, Sancho said to him, \"Your worship should bear in mind, Senor Don \
Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded him in going to \
present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he will have done all \
that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further punishment unless he \
commits some new offence.\" \"Thou hast said well and hit the point,\" \
answered Don Quixote; and so I recall the oath in so far as relates to taking \
fresh vengeance on him, but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I \
have said until such time as I take by force from some knight another helmet \
such as this and as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with \
straw in doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very \
same thing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino's helmet, which cost \
Sacripante so dear.\" \"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"let your worship send all \
such oaths to the devil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and \
prejudicial to the conscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come \
we fall in with no man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to \
be observed in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to \
sleep in your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand other \
mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis of Mantua, \
which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your worship observe that \
there are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads, nothing but \
carriers and carters, who not only do not wear helmets, but perhaps never \
heard tell of them all their lives.\" \"Thou art wrong there,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"for we shall not have been above two hours among these cross-roads \
before we see more men in armour than came to Albraca to win the fair \
Angelica.\" \"Enough,\" said Sancho; \"so be it then, and God grant us \
success, and that the time for winning that island which is costing me so \
dear may soon come, and then let me die.\" \"I have already told thee, \
Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"not to give thyself any uneasiness on that \
score; for if an island should fail, there is the kingdom of Denmark, or of \
Sobradisa, which will fit thee as a ring fits the finger, and all the more \
that, being on terra firma, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let \
us leave that to its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in \
those alforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we \
may lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I swear to thee by \
God, this ear is giving me great pain.\" \"I have here an onion and a little \
cheese and a few scraps of bread,\" said Sancho, \"but they are not victuals \
fit for a valiant knight like your worship.\" \"How little thou knowest about \
it,\" answered Don Quixote; \"I would have thee to know, Sancho, that it is \
the glory of knights-errant to go without eating for a month, and even when \
they do eat, that it should be of what comes first to hand; and this would \
have been clear to thee hadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, \
though they are very many, among them all I have found no mention made of \
knights-errant eating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets \
prepared for them, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And \
though it is plain they could not do without eating and performing all the \
other natural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it \
is plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives through \
woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would be rustic \
viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend Sancho, let not that \
distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to make a new world or \
pervert knight-errantry.\" \"Pardon me, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"for, \
as I cannot read or write, as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend \
the rules of the profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the \
alforjas with every kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; \
and for myself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other \
things more substantial.\" \"I do not say, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \
\"that it is imperative on knights-errant not to eat anything else but the \
fruits thou speakest of; only that their more usual diet must be those, and \
certain herbs they found in the fields which they knew and I know too.\" \"A \
good thing it is,\" answered Sancho, \"to know those herbs, for to my \
thinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into practice.\" \
And here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their repast \
peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for the night, they with \
all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted at once, and made \
haste to reach some habitation before night set in; but daylight and the hope \
of succeeding in their object failed them close by the huts of some \
goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there, and it was as much to \
Sancho's discontent not to have reached a house, as it was to his master's \
satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for he fancied that each time \
this happened to him he performed an act of ownership that helped to prove \
his chivalry. CHAPTER XI. WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS He \
was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best he could \
put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that came from some \
pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and though he would \
have liked at once to try if they were ready to be transferred from the pot \
to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as the goatherds removed them from \
the fire, and laying sheepskins on the ground, quickly spread their rude \
table, and with signs of hearty good-will invited them both to share what \
they had. Round the skins six of the men belonging to the fold seated \
themselves, having first with rough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a \
seat upon a trough which they placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated \
himself, and Sancho remained standing to serve the cup, which was made of \
horn. Seeing him standing, his master said to him: \"That thou mayest see, \
Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains in itself, and how those who \
fill any office in it are on the high road to be speedily honoured and \
esteemed by the world, I desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in \
the company of these worthy people, and that thou be one with me who am thy \
master and natural lord, and that thou eat from my plate and drink from \
whatever I drink from; for the same may be said of knight-errantry as of \
love, that it levels all.\" \"Great thanks,\" said Sancho, \"but I may tell \
your worship that provided I have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or \
better, standing, and by myself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And \
indeed, if the truth is to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or \
fuss has much more relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than \
the turkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink \
little, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I want or \
do other things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude. So, senor, \
as for these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and \
follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for other things which may be of \
more use and advantage to me; for these, though I fully acknowledge them as \
received, I renounce from this moment to the end of the world.\" \"For all \
that,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou must seat thyself, because him who humbleth \
himself God exalteth;\" and seizing him by the arm he forced him to sit down \
beside himself. The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires \
and knights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their \
guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as big \
as one's fist. The course of meat finished, they spread upon the sheepskins a \
great heap of parched acorns, and with them they put down a half cheese \
harder than if it had been made of mortar. All this while the horn was not \
idle, for it went round so constantly, now full, now empty, like the bucket \
of a water-wheel, that it soon drained one of the two wine-skins that were in \
sight. When Don Quixote had quite appeased his appetite he took up a handful \
of the acorns, and contemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat \
in this fashion: \"Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave \
the name of golden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in \
this our iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it \
knew not the two words \"mine\" and \"thine\"! In that blessed age all things \
were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to \
stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood \
generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The clear streams and \
running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble abundance. The \
busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts of the rocks and \
hollows of the trees, offering without usance the plenteous produce of their \
fragrant toil to every hand. The mighty cork trees, unenforced save of their \
own courtesy, shed the broad light bark that served at first to roof the \
houses supported by rude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of \
heaven alone. Then all was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the \
dull share of the crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender \
bowels of our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portion \
of her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight the \
children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent and fair \
young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with flowing \
locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover what modesty \
seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornaments like those in use \
to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured in endless fashions, but \
the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy, wherewith they went as bravely \
and becomingly decked as our Court dames with all the rare and far-fetched \
artifices that idle curiosity has taught them. Then the love-thoughts of the \
heart clothed themselves simply and naturally as the heart conceived them, \
nor sought to commend themselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, \
deceit, or malice had then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice \
held her ground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of \
interest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary law had \
not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then there was no \
cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and modesty, as I have said, \
wandered at will alone and unattended, without fear of insult from \
lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were undone it was of their own \
will and pleasure. But now in this hateful age of ours not one is safe, not \
though some new labyrinth like that of Crete conceal and surround her; even \
there the pestilence of gallantry will make its way to them through chinks or \
on the air by the zeal of its accursed importunity, and, despite of all \
seclusion, lead them to ruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and \
wickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend \
maidens, to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this \
order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for the \
hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by \
natural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet, \
seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and feasted me, \
it is right that with all the good-will in my power I should thank you for \
yours.\" All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our \
knight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the golden \
age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary argument to the \
goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a word in \
reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ate acorns, and paid repeated \
visits to the second wine-skin, which they had hung up on a cork tree to keep \
the wine cool. Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in \
finishing, at the end of which one of the goatherds said, \"That your \
worship, senor knight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you \
hospitality with ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by \
making one of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a \
very intelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and \
write and play on the rebeck to perfection.\" The goatherd had hardly done \
speaking, when the notes of the rebeck reached their ears; and shortly after, \
the player came up, a very good-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. \
His comrades asked him if he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he \
who had already made the offer said to him: \"In that case, Antonio, thou \
mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing a little, that the gentleman, \
our guest, may see that even in the mountains and woods there are musicians: \
we have told him of thy accomplishments, and we want thee to show them and \
prove that we say true; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that \
ballad about thy love that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was \
so much liked in the town.\" \"With all my heart,\" said the young man, and \
without waiting for more pressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled \
oak, and tuning his rebeck, presently began to sing to these words. ANTONIO'S \
BALLAD Thou dost love me well, Olalla; Well I know it, even though Love's \
mute tongues, thine eyes, have never By their glances told me so. For I know \
my love thou knowest, Therefore thine to claim I dare: Once it ceases to be \
secret, Love need never feel despair. True it is, Olalla, sometimes Thou hast \
all too plainly shown That thy heart is brass in hardness, And thy snowy \
bosom stone. Yet for all that, in thy coyness, And thy fickle fits between, \
Hope is there--at least the border Of her garment may be seen. Lures to faith \
are they, those glimpses, And to faith in thee I hold; Kindness cannot make \
it stronger, Coldness cannot make it cold. If it be that love is gentle, In \
thy gentleness I see Something holding out assurance To the hope of winning \
thee. If it be that in devotion Lies a power hearts to move, That which every \
day I show thee, Helpful to my suit should prove. Many a time thou must have \
noticed-- If to notice thou dost care-- How I go about on Monday Dressed in \
all my Sunday wear. Love's eyes love to look on brightness; Love loves what \
is gaily drest; Sunday, Monday, all I care is Thou shouldst see me in my \
best. No account I make of dances, Or of strains that pleased thee so, \
Keeping thee awake from midnight Till the cocks began to crow; Or of how I \
roundly swore it That there's none so fair as thou; True it is, but as I said \
it, By the girls I'm hated now. For Teresa of the hillside At my praise of \
thee was sore; Said, \"You think you love an angel; It's a monkey you adore; \
\"Caught by all her glittering trinkets, And her borrowed braids of hair, And \
a host of made-up beauties That would Love himself ensnare.\" 'T was a lie, \
and so I told her, And her cousin at the word Gave me his defiance for it; \
And what followed thou hast heard. Mine is no high-flown affection, Mine no \
passion par amours-- As they call it--what I offer Is an honest love, and \
pure. Cunning cords the holy Church has, Cords of softest silk they be; Put \
thy neck beneath the yoke, dear; Mine will follow, thou wilt see. Else--and \
once for all I swear it By the saint of most renown-- If I ever quit the \
mountains, 'T will be in a friar's gown. Here the goatherd brought his song \
to an end, and though Don Quixote entreated him to sing more, Sancho had no \
mind that way, being more inclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so \
said he to his master, \"Your worship will do well to settle at once where \
you mean to pass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does \
not allow them to spend the night in singing.\" \"I understand thee, \
Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"I perceive clearly that those visits to the \
wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather than in music.\" \"It's sweet \
to us all, blessed be God,\" said Sancho. \"I do not deny it,\" replied Don \
Quixote; \"but settle thyself where thou wilt; those of my calling are more \
becomingly employed in watching than in sleeping; still it would be as well \
if thou wert to dress this ear for me again, for it is giving me more pain \
than it need.\" Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing \
the wound, told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which \
it would be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which \
there was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a little \
salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage, \
assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so it proved. \
CHAPTER XII. OF WHAT A GOATHERD RELATED TO THOSE WITH DON QUIXOTE Just then \
another young man, one of those who fetched their provisions from the \
village, came up and said, \"Do you know what is going on in the village, \
comrades?\" \"How could we know it?\" replied one of them. \"Well, then, you \
must know,\" continued the young man, \"this morning that famous \
student-shepherd called Chrysostom died, and it is rumoured that he died of \
love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of Guillermo the Rich, she \
that wanders about the wolds here in the dress of a shepherdess.\" \"You mean \
Marcela?\" said one. \"Her I mean,\" answered the goatherd; \"and the best of \
it is, he has directed in his will that he is to be buried in the fields like \
a Moor, and at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is, because, \
as the story goes (and they say he himself said so), that was the place where \
he first saw her. And he has also left other directions which the clergy of \
the village say should not and must not be obeyed because they savour of \
paganism. To all which his great friend Ambrosio the student, he who, like \
him, also went dressed as a shepherd, replies that everything must be done \
without any omission according to the directions left by Chrysostom, and \
about this the village is all in commotion; however, report says that, after \
all, what Ambrosio and all the shepherds his friends desire will be done, and \
to-morrow they are coming to bury him with great ceremony where I said. I am \
sure it will be something worth seeing; at least I will not fail to go and \
see it even if I knew I should not return to the village tomorrow.\" \"We \
will do the same,\" answered the goatherds, \"and cast lots to see who must \
stay to mind the goats of all.\" \"Thou sayest well, Pedro,\" said one, \
\"though there will be no need of taking that trouble, for I will stay behind \
for all; and don't suppose it is virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is \
that the splinter that ran into my foot the other day will not let me walk.\" \
\"For all that, we thank thee,\" answered Pedro. Don Quixote asked Pedro to \
tell him who the dead man was and who the shepherdess, to which Pedro replied \
that all he knew was that the dead man was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a \
village in those mountains, who had been a student at Salamanca for many \
years, at the end of which he returned to his village with the reputation of \
being very learned and deeply read. \"Above all, they said, he was learned in \
the science of the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the \
sun and the moon, for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact \
time.\" \"Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two \
luminaries,\" said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with \
trifles, went on with his story, saying, \"Also he foretold when the year was \
going to be one of abundance or estility.\" \"Sterility, you mean,\" said Don \
Quixote. \"Sterility or estility,\" answered Pedro, \"it is all the same in \
the end. And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who believed \
him grew very rich because they did as he advised them, bidding them 'sow \
barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow pulse and not barley; the \
next there will be a full oil crop, and the three following not a drop will \
be got.'\" \"That science is called astrology,\" said Don Quixote. \"I do not \
know what it is called,\" replied Pedro, \"but I know that he knew all this \
and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months had passed after he \
returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared dressed as a shepherd with \
his crook and sheepskin, having put off the long gown he wore as a scholar; \
and at the same time his great friend, Ambrosio by name, who had been his \
companion in his studies, took to the shepherd's dress with him. I forgot to \
say that Chrysostom, who is dead, was a great man for writing verses, so much \
so that he made carols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which \
the young men of our village acted, and all said they were excellent. When \
the villagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd's \
dress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them to \
make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of our Chrysostom \
died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property in chattels as well \
as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a large sum of money, of \
all of which the young man was left dissolute owner, and indeed he was \
deserving of it all, for he was a very good comrade, and kind-hearted, and a \
friend of worthy folk, and had a countenance like a benediction. Presently it \
came to be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to \
wander about these wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a \
while ago, with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must \
tell you now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps, \
and even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it all \
the days of your life, though you should live more years than sarna.\" \"Say \
Sarra,\" said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd's confusion of \
words. \"The sarna lives long enough,\" answered Pedro; \"and if, senor, you \
must go finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of \
it this twelvemonth.\" \"Pardon me, friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"but, as \
there is such a difference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; \
however, you have answered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: \
so continue your story, and I will not object any more to anything.\" \"I say \
then, my dear sir,\" said the goatherd, \"that in our village there was a \
farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was named Guillermo, \
and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great wealth, a daughter at whose \
birth her mother died, the most respected woman there was in this \
neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with that countenance which had the \
sun on one side and the moon on the other; and moreover active, and kind to \
the poor, for which I trust that at the present moment her soul is in bliss \
with God in the other world. Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death \
of so good a wife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the \
care of an uncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl \
grew up with such beauty that it reminded us of her mother's, which was very \
great, and yet it was thought that the daughter's would exceed it; and so \
when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but \
blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater number were in \
love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and \
retirement, but for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as \
well for it as for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and \
importuned, to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of \
those many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them. But \
he, being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in marriage at \
once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so without her \
consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which the custody of \
the girl's property brought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, \
this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. \
For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages \
everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as \
I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners \
to speak well of him, especially in villages.\" \"That is the truth,\" said \
Don Quixote; \"but go on, for the story is very good, and you, good Pedro, \
tell it with very good grace.\" \"May that of the Lord not be wanting to \
me,\" said Pedro; \"that is the one to have. To proceed; you must know that \
though the uncle put before his niece and described to her the qualities of \
each one in particular of the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her \
to marry and make a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any \
other answer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so \
young she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At \
these, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle ceased \
to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could \
mate herself to her own liking. For, said he--and he said quite \
right--parents are not to settle children in life against their will. But \
when one least looked for it, lo and behold! one day the demure Marcela makes \
her appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite of her uncle and all those \
of the town that strove to dissuade her, took to going a-field with the other \
shepherd-lasses of the village, and tending her own flock. And so, since she \
appeared in public, and her beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well \
tell you how many rich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the \
costume of Chrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of \
these, as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they say \
that he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose, because Marcela \
chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so little or rather no \
retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even the semblance of one, \
for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on the contrary, such and so \
great is the vigilance with which she watches over her honour, that of all \
those that court and woo her not one has boasted, or can with truth boast, \
that she has given him any hope however small of obtaining his desire. For \
although she does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the \
shepherds, and treats them courteously and kindly, should any one of them \
come to declare his intention to her, though it be one as proper and holy as \
that of matrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with this \
kind of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague had \
got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts of those \
that associate with her to love her and to court her, but her scorn and her \
frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so they know not what to \
say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted, and other names of the \
same sort which well describe the nature of her character; and if you should \
remain here any time, senor, you would hear these hills and valleys \
resounding with the laments of the rejected ones who pursue her. Not far from \
this there is a spot where there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and \
there is not one of them but has carved and written on its smooth bark the \
name of Marcela, and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her \
lover would say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human \
beauty. Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there love \
songs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the hours of the \
night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there, without having \
closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the morning bemused and bereft \
of sense; and another without relief or respite to his sighs, stretched on \
the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer noontide, makes his \
appeal to the compassionate heavens, and over one and the other, over these \
and all, the beautiful Marcela triumphs free and careless. And all of us that \
know her are waiting to see what her pride will come to, and who is to be the \
happy man that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gaining \
possession of a beauty so supreme. All that I have told you being such \
well-established truth, I am persuaded that what they say of the cause of \
Chrysostom's death, as our lad told us, is the same. And so I advise you, \
senor, fail not to be present to-morrow at his burial, which will be well \
worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends, and it is not half a league \
from this place to where he directed he should be buried.\" \"I will make a \
point of it,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I thank you for the pleasure you have \
given me by relating so interesting a tale.\" \"Oh,\" said the goatherd, \"I \
do not know even the half of what has happened to the lovers of Marcela, but \
perhaps to-morrow we may fall in with some shepherd on the road who can tell \
us; and now it will be well for you to go and sleep under cover, for the \
night air may hurt your wound, though with the remedy I have applied to you \
there is no fear of an untoward result.\" Sancho Panza, who was wishing the \
goatherd's loquacity at the devil, on his part begged his master to go into \
Pedro's hut to sleep. He did so, and passed all the rest of the night in \
thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in imitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho \
Panza settled himself between Rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a \
lover who had been discarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked. \
CHAPTER XIII. IN WHICH IS ENDED THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS MARCELA, WITH \
OTHER INCIDENTS Bit hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies \
of the east, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and \
tell him that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of \
Chrysostom they would bear him company. Don Quixote, who desired nothing \
better, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once, which he did \
with all despatch, and with the same they all set out forthwith. They had not \
gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they saw coming \
towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins and with their \
heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter oleander. Each of them \
carried a stout holly staff in his hand, and along with them there came two \
men of quality on horseback in handsome travelling dress, with three servants \
on foot accompanying them. Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, \
and inquiring one of the other which way each party was going, they learned \
that all were bound for the scene of the burial, so they went on all \
together. One of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, \
\"It seems to me, Senor Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay \
we shall incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable it cannot \
but be judging by the strange things these shepherds have told us, of both \
the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.\" \"So I think too,\" replied \
Vivaldo, \"and I would delay not to say a day, but four, for the sake of \
seeing it.\" Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela and \
Chrysostom. The traveller answered that the same morning they had met these \
shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they had asked \
them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one of them gave, \
describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a shepherdess called Marcela, \
and the loves of many who courted her, together with the death of that \
Chrysostom to whose burial they were going. In short, he repeated all that \
Pedro had related to Don Quixote. This conversation dropped, and another was \
commenced by him who was called Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the \
reason that led him to go armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. To \
which Don Quixote replied, \"The pursuit of my calling does not allow or \
permit me to go in any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were \
invented for soft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and \
made for those alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though \
unworthy, am the least of all.\" The instant they heard this all set him down \
as mad, and the better to settle the point and discover what kind of madness \
his was, Vivaldo proceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant. \"Have not \
your worships,\" replied Don Quixote, \"read the annals and histories of \
England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of King Arthur, whom we in \
our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus, with regard to whom it is \
an ancient tradition, and commonly received all over that kingdom of Great \
Britain, that this king did not die, but was changed by magic art into a \
raven, and that in process of time he is to return to reign and recover his \
kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it cannot be proved that from that time \
to this any Englishman ever killed a raven? Well, then, in the time of this \
good king that famous order of chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table was \
instituted, and the amour of Don Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen \
Guinevere occurred, precisely as is there related, the go-between and \
confidante therein being the highly honourable dame Quintanona, whence came \
that ballad so well known and widely spread in our Spain-- O never surely was \
there knight So served by hand of dame, As served was he Sir Lancelot hight \
When he from Britain came-- with all the sweet and delectable course of his \
achievements in love and war. Handed down from that time, then, this order of \
chivalry went on extending and spreading itself over many and various parts \
of the world; and in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mighty \
Amadis of Gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth generation, and \
the valiant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the never sufficiently praised \
Tirante el Blanco, and in our own days almost we have seen and heard and \
talked with the invincible knight Don Belianis of Greece. This, then, sirs, \
is to be a knight-errant, and what I have spoken of is the order of his \
chivalry, of which, as I have already said, I, though a sinner, have made \
profession, and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do I profess, \
and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking adventures, resolved in \
soul to oppose my arm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer \
me in aid of the weak and needy.\" By these words of his the travellers were \
able to satisfy themselves of Don Quixote's being out of his senses and of \
the form of madness that overmastered him, at which they felt the same \
astonishment that all felt on first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, \
who was a person of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to \
beguile the short journey which they said was required to reach the mountain, \
the scene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of going on with \
his absurdities. So he said to him, \"It seems to me, Senor Knight-errant, \
that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions in \
the world, and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not so austere.\
\" \"As austere it may perhaps be,\" replied our Don Quixote, \"but so \
necessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if the truth \
is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain orders does no less \
than the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning, is, that churchmen \
in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of the world, but we \
soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray for, defending it with \
the might of our arms and the edge of our swords, not under shelter but in \
the open air, a target for the intolerable rays of the sun in summer and the \
piercing frosts of winter. Thus are we God's ministers on earth and the arms \
by which his justice is done therein. And as the business of war and all that \
relates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding great sweat, \
toil, and exertion, it follows that those who make it their profession have \
undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil peace and quiet are \
engaged in praying to God to help the weak. I do not mean to say, nor does it \
enter into my thoughts, that the knight-errant's calling is as good as that \
of the monk in his cell; I would merely infer from what I endure myself that \
it is beyond a doubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier \
and thirstier, a wretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to \
doubt that the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of \
their lives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be \
emperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat; and if \
those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages to help them \
they would have been completely baulked in their ambition and disappointed in \
their hopes.\" \"That is my own opinion,\" replied the traveller; \"but one \
thing among many others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is \
that when they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous \
adventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they never \
at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to God, as is \
the duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead of which they commend \
themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if these were their gods, \
a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of heathenism.\" \"Sir,\" \
answered Don Quixote, \"that cannot be on any account omitted, and the \
knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is usual and \
customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on engaging in any \
great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn his eyes towards her \
softly and lovingly, as though with them entreating her to favour and protect \
him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake, and even though no one \
hear him, he is bound to say certain words between his teeth, commending \
himself to her with all his heart, and of this we have innumerable instances \
in the histories. Nor is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit \
commending themselves to God, for there will be time and opportunity for \
doing so while they are engaged in their task.\" \"For all that,\" answered \
the traveller, \"I feel some doubt still, because often I have read how words \
will arise between two knights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes \
about that their anger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a \
good stretch of field, and then without any more ado at the top of their \
speed they come to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commend \
themselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter is that \
one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through and through by his \
antagonist's lance, and as for the other, it is only by holding on to the \
mane of his horse that he can help falling to the ground; but I know not how \
the dead man had time to commend himself to God in the course of such rapid \
work as this; it would have been better if those words which he spent in \
commending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been devoted to \
his duty and obligation as a Christian. Moreover, it is my belief that all \
knights-errant have not ladies to commend themselves to, for they are not all \
in love.\" \"That is impossible,\" said Don Quixote: \"I say it is impossible \
that there could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as \
natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most \
certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a \
knight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that without one he \
would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who had gained \
entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by the door, but \
over the wall like a thief and a robber.\" \"Nevertheless,\" said the \
traveller, \"if I remember rightly, I think I have read that Don Galaor, the \
brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul, never had any special lady to whom he \
might commend himself, and yet he was not the less esteemed, and was a very \
stout and famous knight.\" To which our Don Quixote made answer, \"Sir, one \
solitary swallow does not make summer; moreover, I know that knight was in \
secret very deeply in love; besides which, that way of falling in love with \
all that took his fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. \
But, in short, it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made \
mistress of his will, to whom he commended himself very frequently and very \
secretly, for he prided himself on being a reticent knight.\" \"Then if it be \
essential that every knight-errant should be in love,\" said the traveller, \
\"it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so, as you are of the order; \
and if you do not pride yourself on being as reticent as Don Galaor, I \
entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the name of all this company and in my \
own, to inform us of the name, country, rank, and beauty of your lady, for \
she will esteem herself fortunate if all the world knows that she is loved \
and served by such a knight as your worship seems to be.\" At this Don \
Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I cannot say positively whether my \
sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know I serve her; I can \
only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked of me, that her name \
is Dulcinea, her country El Toboso, a village of La Mancha, her rank must be \
at least that of a princess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty \
superhuman, since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which \
the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs are gold, \
her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks \
roses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom \
marble, her hands ivory, her fairness snow, and what modesty conceals from \
sight such, I think and imagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not \
compare.\" \"We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry,\" said \
Vivaldo. To which Don Quixote replied, \"She is not of the ancient Roman \
Curtii, Caii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of the \
Moncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas or Villanovas of \
Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas, Alagones, Urreas, \
Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques, Mendozas, or Guzmans of \
Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses of Portugal; but she is of those of \
El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage that though modern, may furnish a source of \
gentle blood for the most illustrious families of the ages that are to come, \
and this let none dispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino placed \
at the foot of the trophy of Orlando's arms, saying, 'These let none move Who \
dareth not his might with Roland prove.'\" \"Although mine is of the \
Cachopins of Laredo,\" said the traveller, \"I will not venture to compare it \
with that of El Toboso of La Mancha, though, to tell the truth, no such \
surname has until now ever reached my ears.\" \"What!\" said Don Quixote, \
\"has that never reached them?\" The rest of the party went along listening \
with great attention to the conversation of the pair, and even the very \
goatherds and shepherds perceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don \
Quixote was. Sancho Panza alone thought that what his master said was the \
truth, knowing who he was and having known him from his birth; and all that \
he felt any difficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del \
Toboso, because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to \
his knowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso. They were going along \
conversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap between two high \
mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in sheepskins of black wool, and \
crowned with garlands which, as afterwards appeared, were, some of them of \
yew, some of cypress. Six of the number were carrying a bier covered with a \
great variety of flowers and branches, on seeing which one of the goatherds \
said, \"Those who come there are the bearers of Chrysostom's body, and the \
foot of that mountain is the place where he ordered them to bury him.\" They \
therefore made haste to reach the spot, and did so by the time those who came \
had laid the bier upon the ground, and four of them with sharp pickaxes were \
digging a grave by the side of a hard rock. They greeted each other \
courteously, and then Don Quixote and those who accompanied him turned to \
examine the bier, and on it, covered with flowers, they saw a dead body in \
the dress of a shepherd, to all appearance of one thirty years of age, and \
showing even in death that in life he had been of comely features and gallant \
bearing. Around him on the bier itself were laid some books, and several \
papers open and folded; and those who were looking on as well as those who \
were opening the grave and all the others who were there preserved a strange \
silence, until one of those who had borne the body said to another, \"Observe \
carefully, Ambrosia if this is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are \
anxious that what he directed in his will should be so strictly complied \
with.\" \"This is the place,\" answered Ambrosia \"for in it many a time did \
my poor friend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he told \
me, that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race, and \
here, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, as honourable \
as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcela ended by scorning and \
rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his wretched life to a close; \
here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he desired to be laid in the bowels \
of eternal oblivion.\" Then turning to Don Quixote and the travellers he went \
on to say, \"That body, sirs, on which you are looking with compassionate \
eyes, was the abode of a soul on which Heaven bestowed a vast share of its \
riches. That is the body of Chrysostom, who was unrivalled in wit, unequalled \
in courtesy, unapproached in gentle bearing, a phoenix in friendship, \
generous without limit, grave without arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, \
in short, first in all that constitutes goodness and second to none in all \
that makes up misfortune. He loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, he was \
scorned; he wooed a wild beast, he pleaded with marble, he pursued the wind, \
he cried to the wilderness, he served ingratitude, and for reward was made \
the prey of death in the mid-course of life, cut short by a shepherdess whom \
he sought to immortalise in the memory of man, as these papers which you see \
could fully prove, had he not commanded me to consign them to the fire after \
having consigned his body to the earth.\" \"You would deal with them more \
harshly and cruelly than their owner himself,\" said Vivaldo, \"for it is \
neither right nor proper to do the will of one who enjoins what is wholly \
unreasonable; it would not have been reasonable in Augustus Caesar had he \
permitted the directions left by the divine Mantuan in his will to be carried \
into effect. So that, Senor Ambrosia while you consign your friend's body to \
the earth, you should not consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave \
the order in bitterness of heart, it is not right that you should \
irrationally obey it. On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let \
the cruelty of Marcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come \
to all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of us who \
have come here know already the story of this your love-stricken and \
heart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and the cause of his \
death, and the directions he gave at the close of his life; from which sad \
story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of Marcela, the love of \
Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship, together with the end \
awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens to their \
eyes. Last night we learned the death of Chrysostom and that he was to be \
buried here, and out of curiosity and pity we left our direct road and \
resolved to come and see with our eyes that which when heard of had so moved \
our compassion, and in consideration of that compassion and our desire to \
prove it if we might by condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosia, or at \
least I on my own account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers \
you allow me to carry away some of them.\" And without waiting for the \
shepherd's answer, he stretched out his hand and took up some of those that \
were nearest to him; seeing which Ambrosio said, \"Out of courtesy, senor, I \
will grant your request as to those you have taken, but it is idle to expect \
me to abstain from burning the remainder.\" Vivaldo, who was eager to see \
what the papers contained, opened one of them at once, and saw that its title \
was \"Lay of Despair.\" Ambrosio hearing it said, \"That is the last paper \
the unhappy man wrote; and that you may see, senor, to what an end his \
misfortunes brought him, read it so that you may be heard, for you will have \
time enough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug.\" \"I will \
do so very willingly,\" said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanders were equally \
eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loud voice, found that it \
ran as follows. CHAPTER XIV. WHEREIN ARE INSERTED THE DESPAIRING VERSES OF \
THE DEAD SHEPHERD, TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS NOT LOOKED FOR THE LAY OF \
CHRYSOSTOM Since thou dost in thy cruelty desire The ruthless rigour of thy \
tyranny From tongue to tongue, from land to land proclaimed, The very Hell \
will I constrain to lend This stricken breast of mine deep notes of woe To \
serve my need of fitting utterance. And as I strive to body forth the tale Of \
all I suffer, all that thou hast done, Forth shall the dread voice roll, and \
bear along Shreds from my vitals torn for greater pain. Then listen, not to \
dulcet harmony, But to a discord wrung by mad despair Out of this bosom's \
depths of bitterness, To ease my heart and plant a sting in thine. The lion's \
roar, the fierce wolf's savage howl, The horrid hissing of the scaly snake, \
The awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed, The crow's ill-boding croak, the \
hollow moan Of wild winds wrestling with the restless sea, The wrathful \
bellow of the vanquished bull, The plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove, The \
envied owl's sad note, the wail of woe That rises from the dreary choir of \
Hell, Commingled in one sound, confusing sense, Let all these come to aid my \
soul's complaint, For pain like mine demands new modes of song. No echoes of \
that discord shall be heard Where Father Tagus rolls, or on the banks Of \
olive-bordered Betis; to the rocks Or in deep caverns shall my plaint be \
told, And by a lifeless tongue in living words; Or in dark valleys or on \
lonely shores, Where neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls; Or in among the \
poison-breathing swarms Of monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile. For, \
though it be to solitudes remote The hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows sound \
Thy matchless cruelty, my dismal fate Shall carry them to all the spacious \
world. Disdain hath power to kill, and patience dies Slain by suspicion, be \
it false or true; And deadly is the force of jealousy; Long absence makes of \
life a dreary void; No hope of happiness can give repose To him that ever \
fears to be forgot; And death, inevitable, waits in hall. But I, by some \
strange miracle, live on A prey to absence, jealousy, disdain; Racked by \
suspicion as by certainty; Forgotten, left to feed my flame alone. And while \
I suffer thus, there comes no ray Of hope to gladden me athwart the gloom; \
Nor do I look for it in my despair; But rather clinging to a cureless woe, \
All hope do I abjure for evermore. Can there be hope where fear is? Were it \
well, When far more certain are the grounds of fear? Ought I to shut mine \
eyes to jealousy, If through a thousand heart-wounds it appears? Who would \
not give free access to distrust, Seeing disdain unveiled, and--bitter \
change!-- All his suspicions turned to certainties, And the fair truth \
transformed into a lie? Oh, thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love, Oh, \
Jealousy! put chains upon these hands, And bind me with thy strongest cord, \
Disdain. But, woe is me! triumphant over all, My sufferings drown the memory \
of you. And now I die, and since there is no hope Of happiness for me in life \
or death, Still to my fantasy I'll fondly cling. I'll say that he is wise who \
loveth well, And that the soul most free is that most bound In thraldom to \
the ancient tyrant Love. I'll say that she who is mine enemy In that fair \
body hath as fair a mind, And that her coldness is but my desert, And that by \
virtue of the pain he sends Love rules his kingdom with a gentle sway. Thus, \
self-deluding, and in bondage sore, And wearing out the wretched shred of \
life To which I am reduced by her disdain, I'll give this soul and body to \
the winds, All hopeless of a crown of bliss in store. Thou whose injustice \
hath supplied the cause That makes me quit the weary life I loathe, As by \
this wounded bosom thou canst see How willingly thy victim I become, Let not \
my death, if haply worth a tear, Cloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy \
bright eyes; I would not have thee expiate in aught The crime of having made \
my heart thy prey; But rather let thy laughter gaily ring And prove my death \
to be thy festival. Fool that I am to bid thee! well I know Thy glory gains \
by my untimely end. And now it is the time; from Hell's abyss Come thirsting \
Tantalus, come Sisyphus Heaving the cruel stone, come Tityus With vulture, \
and with wheel Ixion come, And come the sisters of the ceaseless toil; And \
all into this breast transfer their pains, And (if such tribute to despair be \
due) Chant in their deepest tones a doleful dirge Over a corse unworthy of a \
shroud. Let the three-headed guardian of the gate, And all the monstrous \
progeny of hell, The doleful concert join: a lover dead Methinks can have no \
fitter obsequies. Lay of despair, grieve not when thou art gone Forth from \
this sorrowing heart: my misery Brings fortune to the cause that gave thee \
birth; Then banish sadness even in the tomb. The \"Lay of Chrysostom\" met \
with the approbation of the listeners, though the reader said it did not seem \
to him to agree with what he had heard of Marcela's reserve and propriety, \
for Chrysostom complained in it of jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to \
the prejudice of the good name and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied \
as one who knew well his friend's most secret thoughts, \"Senor, to remove \
that doubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was \
away from Marcela, from whom he had voluntarily separated himself, to try if \
absence would act with him as it is wont; and as everything distresses and \
every fear haunts the banished lover, so imaginary jealousies and suspicions, \
dreaded as if they were true, tormented Chrysostom; and thus the truth of \
what report declares of the virtue of Marcela remains unshaken, and with her \
envy itself should not and cannot find any fault save that of being cruel, \
somewhat haughty, and very scornful.\" \"That is true,\" said Vivaldo; and as \
he was about to read another paper of those he had preserved from the fire, \
he was stopped by a marvellous vision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly \
presented itself to their eyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were \
digging the grave there appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that \
her beauty exceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her \
gazed upon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see \
her were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. But the \
instant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifest indignation: \"Art \
thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if in thy \
presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being thy cruelty \
has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work of thy humours that \
thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to look down from that height \
upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or in thy arrogance to trample on this \
ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful daughter trampled on her father \
Tarquin's? Tell us quickly for what thou art come, or what it is thou wouldst \
have, for, as I know the thoughts of Chrysostom never failed to obey thee in \
life, I will make all these who call themselves his friends obey thee, though \
he be dead.\" \"I come not, Ambrosia for any of the purposes thou hast named,\
\" replied Marcela, \"but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are \
all those who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom's death; and \
therefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for will \
not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to persons of sense. \
Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so much so that in spite of \
yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and for the love you show me you \
say, and even urge, that I am bound to love you. By that natural \
understanding which God has given me I know that everything beautiful \
attracts love, but I cannot see how, by reason of being loved, that which is \
loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it; besides, it may \
happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness \
being detestable, it is very absurd to say, \"I love thee because thou art \
beautiful, thou must love me though I be ugly.\" But supposing the beauty \
equal on both sides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be \
therefore alike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but \
pleasing the eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beauty \
excited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to and fro \
unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of beautiful \
objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and true love, I have \
heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and not compelled. If \
this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire me to bend my will by \
force, for no other reason but that you say you love me? Nay--tell me--had \
Heaven made me ugly, as it has made me beautiful, could I with justice \
complain of you for not loving me? Moreover, you must remember that the \
beauty I possess was no choice of mine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its \
bounty gave it me without my asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though \
it kills with it, does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as \
it is a gift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; \
for beauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword; the \
one does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not come too near. \
Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, without which the body, \
though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful; but if modesty is one of \
the virtues that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and body, why \
should she who is loved for her beauty part with it to gratify one who for \
his pleasure alone strives with all his might and energy to rob her of it? I \
was born free, and that I might live in freedom I chose the solitude of the \
fields; in the trees of the mountains I find society, the clear waters of the \
brooks are my mirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts \
and charms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whom I have \
inspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words undeceived, and if \
their longings live on hope--and I have given none to Chrysostom or to any \
other--it cannot justly be said that the death of any is my doing, for it was \
rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killed him; and if it be made a \
charge against me that his wishes were honourable, and that therefore I was \
bound to yield to them, I answer that when on this very spot where now his \
grave is made he declared to me his purity of purpose, I told him that mine \
was to live in perpetual solitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the \
fruits of my retirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open \
avowal, he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what \
wonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If I had \
encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should have \
acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was persistent in \
spite of warning, he despaired without being hated. Bethink you now if it be \
reasonable that his suffering should be laid to my charge. Let him who has \
been deceived complain, let him give way to despair whose encouraged hopes \
have proved vain, let him flatter himself whom I shall entice, let him boast \
whom I shall receive; but let not him call me cruel or homicide to whom I \
make no promise, upon whom I practise no deception, whom I neither entice nor \
receive. It has not been so far the will of Heaven that I should love by \
fate, and to expect me to love by choice is idle. Let this general \
declaration serve for each of my suitors on his own account, and let it be \
understood from this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of \
jealousy or misery he dies, for she who loves no one can give no cause for \
jealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded with scorn. Let him who \
calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone as something noxious and \
evil; let him who calls me ungrateful, withhold his service; who calls me \
wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls me cruel, pursue me not; for \
this wild beast, this basilisk, this ungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no \
kind of desire to seek, serve, know, or follow them. If Chrysostom's \
impatience and violent passion killed him, why should my modest behaviour and \
circumspection be blamed? If I preserve my purity in the society of the \
trees, why should he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me \
of it? I have, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of others; \
my taste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I neither love \
nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, or trifle with one \
or play with another. The modest converse of the shepherd girls of these \
hamlets and the care of my goats are my recreations; my desires are bounded \
by these mountains, and if they ever wander hence it is to contemplate the \
beauty of the heavens, steps by which the soul travels to its primeval abode.\
\" With these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned and passed \
into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving all who were there \
lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of her beauty. Some--those \
wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her bright eyes--made as \
though they would follow her, heedless of the frank declaration they had \
heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fitting occasion for the exercise of \
his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels, Don Quixote, laying his hand on \
the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in a loud and distinct voice: \"Let no one, \
whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow the beautiful Marcela, under \
pain of incurring my fierce indignation. She has shown by clear and \
satisfactory arguments that little or no fault is to be found with her for \
the death of Chrysostom, and also how far she is from yielding to the wishes \
of any of her lovers, for which reason, instead of being followed and \
persecuted, she should in justice be honoured and esteemed by all the good \
people of the world, for she shows that she is the only woman in it that \
holds to such a virtuous resolution.\" Whether it was because of the threats \
of Don Quixote, or because Ambrosio told them to fulfil their duty to their \
good friend, none of the shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until, \
having finished the grave and burned Chrysostom's papers, they laid his body \
in it, not without many tears from those who stood by. They closed the grave \
with a heavy stone until a slab was ready which Ambrosio said he meant to \
have prepared, with an epitaph which was to be to this effect: Beneath the \
stone before your eyes The body of a lover lies; In life he was a shepherd \
swain, In death a victim to disdain. Ungrateful, cruel, coy, and fair, Was \
she that drove him to despair, And Love hath made her his ally For spreading \
wide his tyranny. They then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and \
branches, and all expressing their condolence with his friend ambrosio, took \
their Vivaldo and his companion did the same; and Don Quixote bade farewell \
to his hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him to come with them to \
Seville, as being such a convenient place for finding adventures, for they \
presented themselves in every street and round every corner oftener than \
anywhere else. Don Quixote thanked them for their advice and for the \
disposition they showed to do him a favour, and said that for the present he \
would not, and must not go to Seville until he had cleared all these \
mountains of highwaymen and robbers, of whom report said they were full. \
Seeing his good intention, the travellers were unwilling to press him \
further, and once more bidding him farewell, they left him and pursued their \
journey, in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the story of \
Marcela and Chrysostom as well as the madness of Don Quixote. He, on his \
part, resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and make offer to \
her of all the service he could render her; but things did not fall out with \
him as he expected, according to what is related in the course of this \
veracious history, of which the Second Part ends here. CHAPTER XV. IN WHICH \
IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL IN WITH WHEN HE \
FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANS The sage Cide Hamete Benengeli \
relates that as soon as Don Quixote took leave of his hosts and all who had \
been present at the burial of Chrysostom, he and his squire passed into the \
same wood which they had seen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having \
wandered for more than two hours in all directions in search of her without \
finding her, they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside \
which ran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass \
there the hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning to \
come on oppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning \
Rocinante and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, \
they ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very peacefully and \
sociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them. Sancho \
had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling sure, from what \
he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence, that all the mares in \
the Cordova pastures would not lead him into an impropriety. Chance, however, \
and the devil, who is not always asleep, so ordained it that feeding in this \
valley there was a drove of Galician ponies belonging to certain Yanguesan \
carriers, whose way it is to take their midday rest with their teams in \
places and spots where grass and water abound; and that where Don Quixote \
chanced to be suited the Yanguesans' purpose very well. It so happened, then, \
that Rocinante took a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the \
ponies, and abandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them, he, \
without asking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot and \
hastened to make known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, \
preferred their pasture to him, and received him with their heels and teeth \
to such effect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked without a \
saddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was that the \
carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to their mares, came running up \
armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that they brought him sorely \
battered to the ground. By this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had \
witnessed the drubbing of Rocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to \
Sancho: \"So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base \
folk of low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking \
due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our eyes.\" \"What \
the devil vengeance can we take,\" answered Sancho, \"if they are more than \
twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more than one and a \
half?\" \"I count for a hundred,\" replied Don Quixote, and without more \
words he drew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled \
by the example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don \
Quixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather jerkin he \
wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. The Yanguesans, seeing \
themselves assaulted by only two men while they were so many, betook \
themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the middle they began to \
lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the second blow they brought \
Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote fared the same way, all his skill and \
high mettle availing him nothing, and fate willed it that he should fall at \
the feet of Rocinante, who had not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how \
furiously stakes can pound in angry boorish hands. Then, seeing the mischief \
they had done, the Yanguesans with all the haste they could loaded their team \
and pursued their journey, leaving the two adventurers a sorry sight and in \
sorrier mood. Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to \
his master he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, \"Senor Don Quixote, \
ah, Senor Don Quixote!\" \"What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?\" answered Don \
Quixote in the same feeble suffering tone as Sancho. \"I would like, if it \
were possible,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"your worship to give me a couple of \
sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it be that you have any to hand \
there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as well as for wounds.\" \"If I \
only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?\" said Don \
Quixote; \"but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a \
knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, I mean \
to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.\" \"But \
in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet?\" \
answered Sancho Panza. \"For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,\" \
said the battered knight Don Quixote; \"but I take all the blame upon myself, \
for I had no business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed \
knights like myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having \
transgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this \
chastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it \
is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to \
mention to thee, for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us. \
It is at when thou shalt see rabble of this sort offering us insult thou art \
not to wait till I draw sword against them, for I shall not do so at all; but \
do thou draw sword and chastise them to thy heart's content, and if any \
knights come to their aid and defence I will take care to defend thee and \
assail them with all my might; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs \
and proofs what the might of this strong arm of mine is equal to\"--so \
uplifted had the poor gentleman become through the victory over the stout \
Biscayan. But Sancho did not so fully approve of his master's admonition as \
to let it pass without saying in reply, \"Senor, I am a man of peace, meek \
and quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and \
children to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your \
worship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw sword \
either against clown or against knight, and that here before God I forgive \
the insults that have been offered me, whether they have been, are, or shall \
be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble or commoner, not excepting \
any rank or condition whatsoever.\" To all which his master said in reply, \
\"I wish I had breath enough to speak somewhat easily, and that the pain I \
feel on this side would abate so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the \
mistake thou makest. Come now, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto \
so adverse, should turn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so \
that safely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those \
islands I have promised thee, how would it be with thee if on winning it I \
made thee lord of it? Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not \
being a knight nor having any desire to be one, nor possessing the courage \
nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know \
that in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants \
are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is no fear \
of their making some move to change matters once more, and try, as they say, \
what chance may do for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should \
have good sense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend \
himself, whatever may befall him.\" \"In what has now befallen us,\" answered \
Sancho, \"I'd have been well pleased to have that good sense and that valour \
your worship speaks of, but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit \
for plasters than for arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us \
help Rocinante, though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of \
all this thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to be a \
virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right that it \
takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing sure in \
this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as your \
worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling post \
and at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks as has fallen \
upon our shoulders?\" \"And yet thine, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"ought \
to be used to such squalls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it \
is plain they must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were \
not that I imagine--why do I say imagine?--know of a certainty that all these \
annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, I would \
lay me down here to die of pure vexation.\" To this the squire replied, \
\"Senor, as these mishaps are what one reaps of chivalry, tell me if they \
happen very often, or if they have their own fixed times for coming to pass; \
because it seems to me that after two harvests we shall be no good for the \
third, unless God in his infinite mercy helps us.\" \"Know, friend Sancho,\" \
answered Don Quixote, \"that the life of knights-errant is subject to a \
thousand dangers and reverses, and neither more nor less is it within \
immediate possibility for knights-errant to become kings and emperors, as \
experience has shown in the case of many different knights with whose \
histories I am thoroughly acquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain \
would let me, of some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high \
stations I have mentioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced \
divers misfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself \
in the power of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively \
asserted, holding him captive, gave him more than two hundred lashes with the \
reins of his horse while tied to one of the pillars of a court; and moreover \
there is a certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the \
Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pitfall, which opened under his \
feet in a certain castle, on falling found himself bound hand and foot in a \
deep pit underground, where they administered to him one of those things they \
call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he \
had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of \
his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well suffer \
in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities which they \
had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have thee know, Sancho, \
that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be in hand \
inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in express \
words: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he \
has in his hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for \
that reason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this \
lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray \
we have therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, \
with which they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one \
of them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.\" \"They \
gave me no time to see that much,\" answered Sancho, \"for hardly had I laid \
hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with their \
sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength \
out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether \
all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, \
which the pain of the blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on \
my memory as on my shoulders.\" \"For all that let me tell thee, brother \
Panza,\" said Don Quixote, \"that there is no recollection which time does \
not put an end to, and no pain which death does not remove.\" \"And what \
greater misfortune can there be,\" replied Panza, \"than the one that waits \
for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our mishap were one \
of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; \
but I am beginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't \
be enough to put us right.\" \"No more of that: pluck strength out of \
weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,\" returned Don Quixote, \"and let us see \
how Rocinante is, for it seems to me that not the least share of this mishap \
has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.\" \"There is nothing wonderful in \
that,\" replied Sancho, \"since he is a knight-errant too; what I wonder at \
is that my beast should have come off scot-free where we come out scotched.\" \
\"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to \
it,\" said Don Quixote; \"I say so because this little beast may now supply \
the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured \
of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so \
mounted, for I remember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and \
instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the \
hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass.\" \"It may be \
true that he went mounted as your worship says,\" answered Sancho, \"but \
there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung like a sack \
of manure.\" To which Don Quixote replied, \"Wounds received in battle confer \
honour instead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as \
I told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy \
beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night \
come on and surprise us in these wilds.\" \"And yet I have heard your worship \
say,\" observed Panza, \"that it is very meet for knights-errant to sleep in \
wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it very good fortune.\" \"That is,\" \
said Don Quixote, \"when they cannot help it, or when they are in love; and \
so true is this that there have been knights who have remained two years on \
rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, without \
their ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under \
the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre for--I know \
not if it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the \
reckoning; at any rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what \
pique the Princess Oriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, \
and make haste before a mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.\" \"The very \
devil would be in it in that case,\" said Sancho; and letting off thirty \
\"ohs,\" and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and \
execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raised \
himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring \
himself upright, but with all his pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone \
astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the day; he next raised \
up Rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a tongue to complain with, \
most assuredly neither Sancho nor his master would have been behind him. To \
be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante with a \
leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded more or less in \
the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might be; and, as \
chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to better, he had not \
gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he perceived an \
inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote must needs be a \
castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was not \
one, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was \
settled they had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his \
team without any further controversy. CHAPTER XVI. OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE \
INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE The innkeeper, \
seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho what was amiss with \
him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had fallen down from a \
rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper had a wife whose \
disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have, for she was \
by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she \
at once set about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a very \
comely girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the \
inn, as servant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub \
nose, blind of one eye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her \
shape, to be sure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven \
palms from head to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, \
made her contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass, \
then, helped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for Don \
Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served for \
many years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a carrier whose \
bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and, though only made of \
the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the advantage of it, as \
Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not very even \
trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, full \
of pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to \
the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler \
leather, and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have \
counted without missing one in the reckoning. On this accursed bed Don \
Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and her daughter soon covered him \
with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes--for that was the name of the \
Asturian--held the light for them, and while plastering him, the hostess, \
observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that \
this had more the look of blows than of a fall. It was not blows, Sancho \
said, but that the rock had many points and projections, and that each of \
them had left its mark. \"Pray, senora,\" he added, \"manage to save some \
tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins too are \
rather sore.\" \"Then you must have fallen too,\" said the hostess. \"I did \
not fall,\" said Sancho Panza, \"but from the shock I got at seeing my master \
fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.\" \
\"That may well be,\" said the young girl, \"for it has many a time happened \
to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to the \
ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken as \
if I had really fallen.\" \"There is the point, senora,\" replied Sancho \
Panza, \"that I without dreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, \
find myself with scarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.\" \"How is \
the gentleman called?\" asked Maritornes the Asturian. \"Don Quixote of La \
Mancha,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of \
the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world this long time past.\" \
\"What is a knight-adventurer?\" said the lass. \"Are you so new in the world \
as not to know?\" answered Sancho Panza. \"Well, then, you must know, sister, \
that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in two words is seen drubbed and \
emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needy being in the world, and \
to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.\" \
\"Then how is it,\" said the hostess, \"that belonging to so good a master as \
this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?\" \"It \
is too soon yet,\" answered Sancho, \"for we have only been a month going in \
quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be called \
one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is \
found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, \
and I am left none the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best \
title in Spain.\" To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very \
attentively, and sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the \
hostess by the hand he said to her, \"Believe me, fair lady, you may call \
yourself fortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, \
which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is \
commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I \
am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the \
service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitude while life \
shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled and subject \
to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between my \
teeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my \
liberty.\" The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in \
bewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as \
much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they \
were all meant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being \
accustomed to this kind of language, they stared at him and wondered to \
themselves, for he seemed to them a man of a different sort from those they \
were used to, and thanking him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left \
him, while the Asturian gave her attention to Sancho, who needed it no less \
than his master. The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation \
that night, and she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet \
and the family asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes \
unreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never made promises \
of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made them in a forest \
and without any witness present, for she plumed herself greatly on being a \
lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an employment as servant in an \
inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck had brought her to that \
position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Quixote stood first \
in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sancho made his, \
which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was \
of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that of \
the carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the \
trappings of the two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, \
sleek, plump, and in prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of \
Arevalo, according to the author of this history, who particularly mentions \
this carrier because he knew him very well, and they even say was in some \
degree a relation of his; besides which Cide Hamete Benengeli was a historian \
of great research and accuracy in all things, as is very evident since he \
would not pass over in silence those that have been already mentioned, \
however trifling and insignificant they might be, an example that might be \
followed by those grave historians who relate transactions so curtly and \
briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the work \
being left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A \
thousand blessings on the author of \"Tablante de Ricamonte\" and that of the \
other book in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what \
minuteness they describe everything! To proceed, then: after having paid a \
visit to his team and given them their second feed, the carrier stretched \
himself on his pack-saddles and lay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. \
Sancho was by this time plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to \
sleep the pain of his ribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain \
of his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The inn was all in silence, and \
in the whole of it there was no light except that given by a lantern that \
hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange stillness, and the \
thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described at \
every turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to \
his imagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which \
was that he fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been \
said, all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the \
daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and that \
she, won by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him, and had \
promised to come to his bed for a while that night without the knowledge of \
her parents; and holding all this fantasy that he had constructed as solid \
fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilous risk which his \
virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to commit no \
treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevere \
herself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him. While \
he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour--an unlucky \
one for him--arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her smock, with bare \
feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious \
steps entered the chamber where the three were quartered, in quest of the \
carrier; but scarcely had she gained the door when Don Quixote perceived her, \
and sitting up in his bed in spite of his plasters and the pain of his ribs, \
he stretched out his arms to receive his beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who \
went all doubled up and in silence with her hands before her feeling for her \
lover, encountered the arms of Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly by the \
wrist, and drawing her towards him, while she dared not utter a word, made \
her sit down on the bed. He then felt her smock, and although it was of \
sackcloth it appeared to him to be of the finest and softest silk: on her \
wrists she wore some glass beads, but to him they had the sheen of precious \
Orient pearls: her hair, which in some measure resembled a horse's mane, he \
rated as threads of the brightest gold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed the \
sun himself: her breath, which no doubt smelt of yesterday's stale salad, \
seemed to him to diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and, in \
short, he drew her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in \
the same style as that which he had seen in his books of the other princesses \
who, smitten by love, came with all the adornments that are here set down, to \
see the sorely wounded knight; and so great was the poor gentleman's \
blindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anything else about the good \
lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit, were enough to undeceive \
him; on the contrary, he was persuaded he had the goddess of beauty in his \
arms, and holding her firmly in his grasp he went on to say in low, tender \
voice: \"Would that found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position to \
repay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of your great beauty, \
have granted me; but fortune, which is never weary of persecuting the good, \
has chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie so bruised and broken that \
though my inclination would gladly comply with yours it is impossible; \
besides, to this impossibility another yet greater is to be added, which is \
the faith that I have pledged to the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady \
of my most secret thoughts; and were it not that this stood in the way I \
should not be so insensible a knight as to miss the happy opportunity which \
your great goodness has offered me.\" Maritornes was fretting and sweating at \
finding herself held so fast by Don Quixote, and not understanding or heeding \
the words he addressed to her, she strove without speaking to free herself. \
The worthy carrier, whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his \
doxy the moment she entered the door, and was listening attentively to all \
Don Quixote said; and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word \
with him for another, drew nearer to Don Quixote's bed and stood still to see \
what would come of this talk which he could not understand; but when he \
perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote striving to hold \
her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and delivered such a terrible \
cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed all his mouth in \
blood, and not content with this he mounted on his ribs and with his feet \
tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot. The bed which was \
somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet, unable to support the \
additional weight of the carrier, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash \
of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl \
of Maritornes', because after calling loudly to her he got no answer. With \
this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarter where \
he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that her master was coming \
and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened and panic-stricken made \
for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and crouching upon it made a \
ball of herself. The innkeeper came in exclaiming, \"Where art thou, \
strumpet? Of course this is some of thy work.\" At this Sancho awoke, and \
feeling this mass almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began \
to distribute fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon \
Maritornes, who, irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back \
so many in return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself. He \
then, finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as \
well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and he and she between them began \
the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world. The carrier, however, \
perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared with his \
ladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her the help she needed; and the \
innkeeper did the same but with a different intention, for his was to \
chastise the lass, as he believed that beyond a doubt she alone was the cause \
of all the harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to rope, rope \
to stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him, and the \
innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that they did not give \
themselves a moment's rest; and the best of it was that the innkeeper's lamp \
went out, and as they were left in the dark they all laid on one upon the \
other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a sound spot left where a \
hand could light. It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn \
a caudrillero of what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who, also \
hearing the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff and the tin \
case with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into the room crying: \
\"Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the name of the Holy \
Brotherhood!\" The first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who \
lay stretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his hand \
falling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, \"Help for the \
Jurisdiction!\" but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did not move \
or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in the room were his \
murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voice still higher, calling \
out, \"Shut the inn gate; see that no one goes out; they have killed a man \
here!\" This cry startled them all, and each dropped the contest at the point \
at which the voice reached him. The innkeeper retreated to his room, the \
carrier to his pack-saddles, the lass to her crib; the unlucky Don Quixote \
and Sancho alone were unable to move from where they were. The cuadrillero on \
this let go Don Quixote's beard, and went out to look for a light to search \
for and apprehend the culprits; but not finding one, as the innkeeper had \
purposely extinguished the lantern on retreating to his room, he was \
compelled to have recourse to the hearth, where after much time and trouble \
he lit another lamp. CHAPTER XVII. IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE \
TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON QUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED \
IN THE INN, WHICH TO HIS MISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE By this time Don \
Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the same tone of voice in which \
he had called to his squire the day before when he lay stretched \"in the \
vale of the stakes,\" he began calling to him now, \"Sancho, my friend, art \
thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend Sancho?\" \"How can I sleep, curses on it!\
\" returned Sancho discontentedly and bitterly, \"when it is plain that all \
the devils have been at me this night?\" \"Thou mayest well believe that,\" \
answered Don Quixote, \"because, either I know little, or this castle is \
enchanted, for thou must know-but this that I am now about to tell thee thou \
must swear to keep secret until after my death.\" \"I swear it,\" answered \
Sancho. \"I say so,\" continued Don Quixote, \"because I hate taking away \
anyone's good name.\" \"I say,\" replied Sancho, \"that I swear to hold my \
tongue about it till the end of your worship's days, and God grant I may be \
able to let it out tomorrow.\" \"Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho,\" said \
Don Quixote, \"that thou wouldst see me dead so soon?\" \"It is not for that,\
\" replied Sancho, \"but because I hate keeping things long, and I don't want \
them to grow rotten with me from over-keeping.\" \"At any rate,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"I have more confidence in thy affection and good nature; and so I \
would have thee know that this night there befell me one of the strangest \
adventures that I could describe, and to relate it to thee briefly thou must \
know that a little while ago the daughter of the lord of this castle came to \
me, and that she is the most elegant and beautiful damsel that could be found \
in the wide world. What I could tell thee of the charms of her person! of her \
lively wit! of other secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe to my \
lady Dulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in silence! I will \
only tell thee that, either fate being envious of so great a boon placed in \
my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and this is more probable) this castle \
being, as I have already said, enchanted, at the time when I was engaged in \
the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her, there came, without my \
seeing or knowing whence it came, a hand attached to some arm of some huge \
giant, that planted such a cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in \
blood, and then pummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight than \
yesterday when the carriers, on account of Rocinante's misbehaviour, \
inflicted on us the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there must \
be some enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel's beauty, and \
that it is not for me.\" \"Not for me either,\" said Sancho, \"for more than \
four hundred Moors have so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was \
cakes and fancy-bread to it. But tell me, senor, what do you call this \
excellent and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your \
worship was not so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable beauty \
you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks I think I \
had in all my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me! for I am not a \
knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the mishaps, the greater \
part falls to my share.\" \"Then thou hast been thrashed too?\" said Don \
Quixote. \"Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!\" said Sancho. \"Be not \
distressed, friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will now make the precious \
balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an eye.\" By \
this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and came in to \
see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho caught sight of \
him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a cloth on his head, \
and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding countenance, he said to his \
master, \"Senor, can it be that this is the enchanted Moor coming back to \
give us more castigation if there be anything still left in the ink-bottle?\" \
\"It cannot be the Moor,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for those under \
enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.\" \"If they don't let \
themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,\" said Sancho; \"if not, let \
my shoulders speak to the point.\" \"Mine could speak too,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"but that is not a sufficient reason for believing that what we see \
is the enchanted Moor.\" The officer came up, and finding them engaged in \
such a peaceful conversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, \
still lay on his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. The \
officer turned to him and said, \"Well, how goes it, good man?\" \"I would \
speak more politely if I were you,\" replied Don Quixote; \"is it the way of \
this country to address knights-errant in that style, you booby?\" The \
cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a \
sorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full of oil, \
smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him a badly \
broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and Sancho Panza said, \
\"That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Senor, and he keeps the treasure for \
others, and for us only the cuffs and lamp-whacks.\" \"That is the truth,\" \
answered Don Quixote, \"and there is no use in troubling oneself about these \
matters of enchantment or being angry or vexed at them, for as they are \
invisible and visionary we shall find no one on whom to avenge ourselves, do \
what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou canst, and call the alcaide of this \
fortress, and get him to give me a little oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to \
make the salutiferous balsam, for indeed I believe I have great need of it \
now, because I am losing much blood from the wound that phantom gave me.\" \
Sancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the innkeeper in \
the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see what had become of \
his enemy, he said to him, \"Senor, whoever you are, do us the favour and \
kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt, and wine, for it is wanted \
to cure one of the best knights-errant on earth, who lies on yonder bed \
wounded by the hands of the enchanted Moor that is in this inn.\" When the \
officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out of his senses, \
and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn gate, and calling \
the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The host furnished him with \
what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don Quixote, who, with his hand to \
his head, was bewailing the pain of the blow of the lamp, which had done him \
no more harm than raising a couple of rather large lumps, and what he fancied \
blood was only the sweat that flowed from him in his sufferings during the \
late storm. To be brief, he took the materials, of which he made a compound, \
mixing them all and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had \
come to perfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as there \
was not one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tin oil-bottle or \
flask of which the host made him a free gift; and over the flask he repeated \
more than eighty paternosters and as many more ave-marias, salves, and \
credos, accompanying each word with a cross by way of benediction, at all \
which there were present Sancho, the innkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the \
carrier was now peacefully engaged in attending to the comfort of his mules. \
This being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the spot, \
of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and so he drank \
near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and remained in the \
pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had he done drinking when \
he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was left in his stomach, and \
with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke into a profuse sweat, on \
account of which he bade them cover him up and leave him alone. They did so, \
and he lay sleeping more than three hours, at the end of which he awoke and \
felt very great bodily relief and so much ease from his bruises that he \
thought himself quite cured, and verily believed he had hit upon the balsam \
of Fierabras; and that with this remedy he might thenceforward, without any \
fear, face any kind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it \
might be. Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as \
miraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which was no \
small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with both hands, in \
good faith and with a better will, gulped down and drained off very little \
less than his master. But the fact is, that the stomach of poor Sancho was of \
necessity not so delicate as that of his master, and so, before vomiting, he \
was seized with such gripings and retchings, and such sweats and faintness, \
that verily and truly be believed his last hour had come, and finding himself \
so racked and tormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it \
to him. Don Quixote seeing him in this state said, \"It is my belief, Sancho, \
that this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am persuaded \
this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.\" \"If your worship knew \
that,\" returned Sancho--\"woe betide me and all my kindred!--why did you let \
me taste it?\" At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire \
began to discharge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had \
thrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for \
nothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and \
convulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end had \
come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end of \
which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he \
could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt himself \
relieved and well, was eager to take his departure at once in quest of \
adventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered there was a \
fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his help and \
protection, all the more when he had the security and confidence his balsam \
afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and \
put the pack-saddle on his squire's beast, whom likewise he helped to dress \
and mount the ass; after which he mounted his horse and turning to a corner \
of the inn he laid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a \
lance. All that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood \
watching him; the innkeeper's daughter was likewise observing him, and he too \
never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched a sigh that he \
seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but they all thought it \
must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any rate they who had seen him \
plastered the night before thought so. As soon as they were both mounted, at \
the gate of the inn, he called to the host and said in a very grave and \
measured voice, \"Many and great are the favours, Senor Alcaide, that I have \
received in this castle of yours, and I remain under the deepest obligation \
to be grateful to you for them all the days of my life; if I can repay them \
in avenging you of any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my \
calling is no other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, \
and to chastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this \
kind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of \
knighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation \
to the utmost of your desire.\" The innkeeper replied to him with equal \
calmness, \"Sir Knight, I do not want your worship to avenge me of any wrong, \
because when any is done me I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the \
only thing I want is that you pay me the score that you have run up in the \
inn last night, as well for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for \
supper and beds.\" \"Then this is an inn?\" said Don Quixote. \"And a very \
respectable one,\" said the innkeeper. \"I have been under a mistake all this \
time,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for in truth I thought it was a castle, and \
not a bad one; but since it appears that it is not a castle but an inn, all \
that can be done now is that you should excuse the payment, for I cannot \
contravene the rule of knights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to \
the present I have read nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for \
lodging or anything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality \
that might be offered them is their due by law and right in return for the \
insufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day, in \
summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst, cold \
and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the hardships of \
earth.\" \"I have little to do with that,\" replied the innkeeper; \"pay me \
what you owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care \
about is to get my money.\" \"You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,\" said Don \
Quixote, and putting spurs to Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he \
rode out of the inn before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance \
without looking to see if his squire was following him. The innkeeper when he \
saw him go without paying him ran to get payment of Sancho, who said that as \
his master would not pay neither would he, because, being as he was squire to \
a knight-errant, the same rule and reason held good for him as for his master \
with regard to not paying anything in inns and hostelries. At this the \
innkeeper waxed very wroth, and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in \
a way that he would not like. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of \
chivalry his master had received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him \
his life; for the excellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was not going \
to be violated by him, nor should the squires of such as were yet to come \
into the world ever complain of him or reproach him with breaking so just a \
privilege. The ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among \
the company in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, three \
needle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair of \
Seville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and playful, who, \
almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse, made up to Sancho and \
dismounted him from his ass, while one of them went in for the blanket of the \
host's bed; but on flinging him into it they looked up, and seeing that the \
ceiling was somewhat lower what they required for their work, they decided \
upon going out into the yard, which was bounded by the sky, and there, \
putting Sancho in the middle of the blanket, they began to raise him high, \
making sport with him as they would with a dog at Shrovetide. The cries of \
the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his \
master, who, halting to listen attentively, was persuaded that some new \
adventure was coming, until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who \
uttered them. Wheeling about he came up to the inn with a laborious gallop, \
and finding it shut went round it to see if he could find some way of getting \
in; but as soon as he came to the wall of the yard, which was not very high, \
he discovered the game that was being played with his squire. He saw him \
rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that, had his \
rage allowed him, it is my belief he would have laughed. He tried to climb \
from his horse on to the top of the wall, but he was so bruised and battered \
that he could not even dismount; and so from the back of his horse he began \
to utter such maledictions and objurgations against those who were blanketing \
Sancho as it would be impossible to write down accurately: they, however, did \
not stay their laughter or their work for this, nor did the flying Sancho \
cease his lamentations, mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all \
to little purpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off. \
They then brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it they put his \
jacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him so exhausted, \
thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that it might be all the \
cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took it, and as he was raising it \
to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming, \"Sancho, \
my son, drink not water; drink it not, my son, for it will kill thee; see, \
here I have the blessed balsam (and he held up the flask of liquor), and with \
drinking two drops of it thou wilt certainly be restored.\" At these words \
Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still louder voice said, \"Can it be \
your worship has forgotten that I am not a knight, or do you want me to end \
by vomiting up what bowels I have left after last night? Keep your liquor in \
the name of all the devils, and leave me to myself!\" and at one and the same \
instant he left off talking and began drinking; but as at the first sup he \
perceived it was water he did not care to go on with it, and begged \
Maritornes to fetch him some wine, which she did with right good will, and \
paid for it with her own money; for indeed they say of her that, though she \
was in that line of life, there was some faint and distant resemblance to a \
Christian about her. When Sancho had done drinking he dug his heels into his \
ass, and the gate of the inn being thrown open he passed out very well \
pleased at having paid nothing and carried his point, though it had been at \
the expense of his usual sureties, his shoulders. It is true that the \
innkeeper detained his alforjas in payment of what was owing to him, but \
Sancho took his departure in such a flurry that he never missed them. The \
innkeeper, as soon as he saw him off, wanted to bar the gate close, but the \
blanketers would not agree to it, for they were fellows who would not have \
cared two farthings for Don Quixote, even had he been really one of the \
knights-errant of the Round Table. CHAPTER XVIII. IN WHICH IS RELATED THE \
DISCOURSE SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER, DON QUIXOTE, AND OTHER \
ADVENTURES WORTH RELATING Sancho reached his master so limp and faint that he \
could not urge on his beast. When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he \
said, \"I have now come to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or \
inn is beyond a doubt enchanted, because those who have so atrociously \
diverted themselves with thee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of \
another world? and I hold this confirmed by having noticed that when I was by \
the wall of the yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy, it was out of my \
power to mount upon it, nor could I even dismount from Rocinante, because \
they no doubt had me enchanted; for I swear to thee by the faith of what I am \
that if I had been able to climb up or dismount, I would have avenged thee in \
such a way that those braggart thieves would have remembered their freak for \
ever, even though in so doing I knew that I contravened the laws of chivalry, \
which, as I have often told thee, do not permit a knight to lay hands on him \
who is not one, save in case of urgent and great necessity in defence of his \
own life and person.\" \"I would have avenged myself too if I could,\" said \
Sancho, \"whether I had been dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though \
for my part I am persuaded those who amused themselves with me were not \
phantoms or enchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone \
like ourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them when \
they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and another Tenorio \
Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan Palomeque the \
Left-handed; so that, senor, your not being able to leap over the wall of the \
yard or dismount from your horse came of something else besides enchantments; \
and what I make out clearly from all this is, that these adventures we go \
seeking will in the end lead us into such misadventures that we shall not \
know which is our right foot; and that the best and wisest thing, according \
to my small wits, would be for us to return home, now that it is \
harvest-time, and attend to our business, and give over wandering from Zeca \
to Mecca and from pail to bucket, as the saying is.\" \"How little thou \
knowest about chivalry, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"hold thy peace and \
have patience; the day will come when thou shalt see with thine own eyes what \
an honourable thing it is to wander in the pursuit of this calling; nay, tell \
me, what greater pleasure can there be in the world, or what delight can \
equal that of winning a battle, and triumphing over one's enemy? None, beyond \
all doubt.\" \"Very likely,\" answered Sancho, \"though I do not know it; all \
I know is that since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has \
been one (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number) \
we have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan, and even out \
of that your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the less; and \
from that till now it has been all cudgellings and more cudgellings, cuffs \
and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over and above, and falling in with \
enchanted persons on whom I cannot avenge myself so as to know what the \
delight, as your worship calls it, of conquering an enemy is like.\" \"That \
is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \
\"but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand some sword made by such \
craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect upon him who carries it, \
and it is even possible that fortune may procure for me that which belonged \
to Amadis when he was called 'The Knight of the Burning Sword,' which was one \
of the best swords that ever knight in the world possessed, for, besides \
having the said virtue, it cut like a razor, and there was no armour, however \
strong and enchanted it might be, that could resist it.\" \"Such is my \
luck,\" said Sancho, \"that even if that happened and your worship found some \
such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn out serviceable and good for \
dubbed knights only, and as for the squires, they might sup sorrow.\" \"Fear \
not that, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote: \"Heaven will deal better by thee.\" \
Thus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on the road \
they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them a large and thick \
cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho and said: \"This is the \
day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is reserving for me; \
this, I say, is the day on which as much as on any other shall be displayed \
the might of my arm, and on which I shall do deeds that shall remain written \
in the book of fame for all ages to come. Seest thou that cloud of dust which \
rises yonder? Well, then, all that is churned up by a vast army composed of \
various and countless nations that comes marching there.\" \"According to \
that there must be two,\" said Sancho, \"for on this opposite side also there \
rises just such another cloud of dust.\" Don Quixote turned to look and found \
that it was true, and rejoicing exceedingly, he concluded that they were two \
armies about to engage and encounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at \
all times and seasons his fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, \
adventures, crazy feats, loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books \
of chivalry, and everything he said, thought, or did had reference to such \
things. Now the cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great droves of \
sheep coming along the same road in opposite directions, which, because of \
the dust, did not become visible until they drew near, but Don Quixote \
asserted so positively that they were armies that Sancho was led to believe \
it and say, \"Well, and what are we to do, senor?\" \"What?\" said Don \
Quixote: \"give aid and assistance to the weak and those who need it; and \
thou must know, Sancho, that this which comes opposite to us is conducted and \
led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron, lord of the great isle of Trapobana; \
this other that marches behind me is that of his enemy the king of the \
Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, for he always goes into battle with \
his right arm bare.\" \"But why are these two lords such enemies?\" \"They \
are at enmity,\" replied Don Quixote, \"because this Alifanfaron is a furious \
pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is a very beautiful \
and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and her father is unwilling to \
bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first abandons the religion of his \
false prophet Mahomet, and adopts his own.\" \"By my beard,\" said Sancho, \
\"but Pentapolin does quite right, and I will help him as much as I can.\" \
\"In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"for to \
engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed knight.\" \
\"That I can well understand,\" answered Sancho; \"but where shall we put \
this ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for I \
believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of \
this kind.\" \"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"and what you had best do \
with him is to leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for \
the horses we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even \
Rocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to me and \
observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief knights who \
accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and mark, let \
us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both armies may be \
seen.\" They did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the \
two droves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if \
the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the sight; \
nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and what did not \
exist, he began thus in a loud voice: \"That knight whom thou seest yonder in \
yellow armour, who bears upon his shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet \
of a damsel, is the valiant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in \
armour with flowers of gold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on \
an azure field, is the dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that \
other of gigantic frame, on his right hand, is the ever dauntless \
Brandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour wears \
that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate which, according to tradition, \
is one of those of the temple that Samson brought to the ground when by his \
death he revenged himself upon his enemies. But turn thine eyes to the other \
side, and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the ever \
victorious and never vanquished Timonel of Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, \
who comes in armour with arms quartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and \
bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto which says Miau, \
which is the beginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is \
the peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the \
other, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger and bears \
arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, is a novice \
knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of the baronies of \
Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikes the flanks of that \
nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears azure vair, is the mighty \
duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for device on his shield \
an asparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that says, Rastrea mi suerte.\" \
And so he went on naming a number of knights of one squadron or the other out \
of his imagination, and to all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, \
devices, and mottoes, carried away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; \
and without a pause, he continued, \"People of divers nations compose this \
squadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the \
famous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those that sift \
the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famed cool banks of \
the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and various ways divert the streams \
of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians, faithless in their promises, the \
Persians renowned in archery, the Parthians and the Medes that fight as they \
fly, the Arabs that ever shift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as \
they are fair, the Ethiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other \
nations whose features I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their \
names. In this other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal \
streams of the olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenances \
with the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice in the \
fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesian plains \
abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in the Elysian meadows \
of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears of corn, the wearers of \
iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that bathe in the Pisuerga \
renowned for its gentle current, those that feed their herds along the \
spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed for its hidden course, those \
that tremble with the cold of the pineclad Pyrenees or the dazzling snows of \
the lofty Apennine; in a word, as many as all Europe includes and contains.\" \
Good God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving to each its \
proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and saturated with what \
he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hung upon his words without \
speaking, and from time to time turned to try if he could see the knights and \
giants his master was describing, and as he could not make out one of them he \
said to him: \"Senor, devil take it if there's a sign of any man you talk of, \
knight or giant, in the whole thing; maybe it's all enchantment, like the \
phantoms last night.\" \"How canst thou say that!\" answered Don Quixote; \
\"dost thou not hear the neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, \
the roll of the drums?\" \"I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and \
sheep,\" said Sancho; which was true, for by this time the two flocks had \
come close. \"The fear thou art in, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"prevents \
thee from seeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to \
derange the senses and make things appear different from what they are; if \
thou art in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself, for alone \
I suffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall give my aid;\" and \
so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting the lance in rest, shot \
down the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shouted after him, crying, \"Come \
back, Senor Don Quixote; I vow to God they are sheep and ewes you are \
charging! Come back! Unlucky the father that begot me! what madness is this! \
Look, there is no giant, nor knight, nor cats, nor arms, nor shields \
quartered or whole, nor vair azure or bedevilled. What are you about? Sinner \
that I am before God!\" But not for all these entreaties did Don Quixote turn \
back; on the contrary he went on shouting out, \"Ho, knights, ye who follow \
and fight under the banners of the valiant emperor Pentapolin of the Bare \
Arm, follow me all; ye shall see how easily I shall give him his revenge over \
his enemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana.\" So saying, he dashed into the midst \
of the squadron of ewes, and began spearing them with as much spirit and \
intrepidity as if he were transfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The \
shepherds and drovers accompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing \
it was no use, they ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with \
stones as big as one's fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, \
letting drive right and left kept saying: \"Where art thou, proud \
Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a single knight who would fain prove thy \
prowess hand to hand, and make thee yield thy life a penalty for the wrong \
thou dost to the valiant Pentapolin Garamanta.\" Here came a sugar-plum from \
the brook that struck him on the side and buried a couple of ribs in his \
body. Feeling himself so smitten, he imagined himself slain or badly wounded \
for certain, and recollecting his liquor he drew out his flask, and putting \
it to his mouth began to pour the contents into his stomach; but ere he had \
succeeded in swallowing what seemed to him enough, there came another almond \
which struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairly that it smashed it to \
pieces, knocking three or four teeth and grinders out of his mouth in its \
course, and sorely crushing two fingers of his hand. Such was the force of \
the first blow and of the second, that the poor knight in spite of himself \
came down backwards off his horse. The shepherds came up, and felt sure they \
had killed him; so in all haste they collected their flock together, took up \
the dead beasts, of which there were more than seven, and made off without \
waiting to ascertain anything further. All this time Sancho stood on the hill \
watching the crazy feats his master was performing, and tearing his beard and \
cursing the hour and the occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with \
him. Seeing him, then, brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had \
taken themselves off, he ran to him and found him in very bad case, though \
not unconscious; and said he: \"Did I not tell you to come back, Senor Don \
Quixote; and that what you were going to attack were not armies but droves of \
sheep?\" \"That's how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify \
things,\" answered Don Quixote; \"thou must know, Sancho, that it is a very \
easy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what they choose; and \
this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of the glory he knew I was to \
win in this battle, has turned the squadrons of the enemy into droves of \
sheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg of thee, Sancho, to undeceive \
thyself, and see that what I say is true; mount thy ass and follow them \
quietly, and thou shalt see that when they have gone some little distance \
from this they will return to their original shape and, ceasing to be sheep, \
become men in all respects as I described them to thee at first. But go not \
just yet, for I want thy help and assistance; come hither, and see how many \
of my teeth and grinders are missing, for I feel as if there was not one left \
in my mouth.\" Sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his \
mouth; now just at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don \
Quixote, so, at the very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he \
discharged all its contents with more force than a musket, and full into the \
beard of the compassionate squire. \"Holy Mary!\" cried Sancho, \"what is \
this that has happened me? Clearly this sinner is mortally wounded, as he \
vomits blood from the mouth;\" but considering the matter a little more \
closely he perceived by the colour, taste, and smell, that it was not blood \
but the balsam from the flask which he had seen him drink; and he was taken \
with such a loathing that his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside \
over his very master, and both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to \
his ass to get something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his master, \
out of his alforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh took leave of his \
senses, and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved to quit his master \
and return home, even though he forfeited the wages of his service and all \
hopes of the promised island. Don Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand \
to his mouth to keep his teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he \
laid hold of the bridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master's \
side--so loyal and well-behaved was he--and betook himself to where the \
squire stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like one in \
deep dejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote said to \
him: \"Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he \
does more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs that \
fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with us, for it \
is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence it follows that \
the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh at hand; so thou must \
not distress thyself at the misfortunes which happen to me, since thou hast \
no share in them.\" \"How have I not?\" replied Sancho; \"was he whom they \
blanketed yesterday perchance any other than my father's son? and the \
alforjas that are missing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to \
any other but myself?\" \"What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?\" said Don \
Quixote. \"Yes, they are missing,\" answered Sancho. \"In that case we have \
nothing to eat to-day,\" replied Don Quixote. \"It would be so,\" answered \
Sancho, \"if there were none of the herbs your worship says you know in these \
meadows, those with which knights-errant as unlucky as your worship are wont \
to supply such-like shortcomings.\" \"For all that,\" answered Don Quixote, \
\"I would rather have just now a quarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of \
pilchards' heads, than all the herbs described by Dioscorides, even with \
Doctor Laguna's notes. Nevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and \
come along with me, for God, who provides for all things, will not fail us \
(more especially when we are so active in his service as we are), since he \
fails not the midges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles \
of the water, and is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the good \
and on the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.\" \"Your \
worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,\" said Sancho. \
\"Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,\" said Don \
Quixote; \"for there were knights-errant in former times as well qualified to \
deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an encampment, as if they had \
graduated in the University of Paris; whereby we may see that the lance has \
never blunted the pen, nor the pen the lance.\" \"Well, be it as your worship \
says,\" replied Sancho; \"let us be off now and find some place of shelter \
for the night, and God grant it may be somewhere where there are no blankets, \
nor blanketeers, nor phantoms, nor enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the \
devil take the whole concern.\" \"Ask that of God, my son,\" said Don \
Quixote; \"and do thou lead on where thou wilt, for this time I leave our \
lodging to thy choice; but reach me here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, \
and find out how many of my teeth and grinders are missing from this right \
side of the upper jaw, for it is there I feel the pain.\" Sancho put in his \
fingers, and feeling about asked him, \"How many grinders used your worship \
have on this side?\" \"Four,\" replied Don Quixote, \"besides the back-tooth, \
all whole and quite sound.\" \"Mind what you are saying, senor.\" \"I say \
four, if not five,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for never in my life have I had \
tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or been destroyed by any decay \
or rheum.\" \"Well, then,\" said Sancho, \"in this lower side your worship \
has no more than two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor \
any at all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.\" \"Luckless that \
I am!\" said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squire gave him; \"I had \
rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not the sword-arm; for I tell \
thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a mill without a millstone, and a \
tooth is much more to be prized than a diamond; but we who profess the \
austere order of chivalry are liable to all this. Mount, friend, and lead the \
way, and I will follow thee at whatever pace thou wilt.\" Sancho did as he \
bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which he thought he might find \
refuge without quitting the high road, which was there very much frequented. \
As they went along, then, at a slow pace--for the pain in Don Quixote's jaws \
kept him uneasy and ill-disposed for speed--Sancho thought it well to amuse \
and divert him by talk of some kind, and among the things he said to him was \
that which will be told in the following chapter. CHAPTER XIX. OF THE SHREWD \
DISCOURSE WHICH SANCHO HELD WITH HIS MASTER, AND OF THE ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL \
HIM WITH A DEAD BODY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER NOTABLE OCCURRENCES \"It seems to \
me, senor, that all these mishaps that have befallen us of late have been \
without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed by your worship \
against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath you made not to eat \
bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, and all the rest of it that your \
worship swore to observe until you had taken that helmet of Malandrino's, or \
whatever the Moor is called, for I do not very well remember.\" \"Thou art \
very right, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"but to tell the truth, it had \
escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that the affair of \
the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in not reminding me of it \
in time; but I will make amends, for there are ways of compounding for \
everything in the order of chivalry.\" \"Why! have I taken an oath of some \
sort, then?\" said Sancho. \"It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an \
oath,\" said Don Quixote; \"suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of \
complicity; and whether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves \
with a remedy.\" \"In that case,\" said Sancho, \"mind that your worship does \
not forget this as you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into \
their heads to amuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worship \
if they see you so obstinate.\" While engaged in this and other talk, night \
overtook them on the road before they had reached or discovered any place of \
shelter; and what made it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for \
with the loss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder and \
commissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventure which \
without any invention had really the appearance of one. It so happened that \
the night closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that they pushed on, Sancho \
feeling sure that as the road was the king's highway they might reasonably \
expect to find some inn within a league or two. Going along, then, in this \
way, the night dark, the squire hungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming \
towards them on the road they were travelling a great number of lights which \
looked exactly like stars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at the sight of \
them, nor did Don Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass \
by the halter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still, \
watching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and found that \
the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came the greater they \
seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a man dosed with \
mercury, and Don Quixote's hair stood on end; he, however, plucking up spirit \
a little, said: \"This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous \
adventure, in which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and \
resolution.\" \"Unlucky me!\" answered Sancho; \"if this adventure happens to \
be one of phantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the \
ribs to bear it?\" \"Be they phantoms ever so much,\" said Don Quixote, \"I \
will not permit them to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played \
tricks with thee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the \
walls of the yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to \
wield my sword as I please.\" \"And if they enchant and cripple you as they \
did the last time,\" said Sancho, \"what difference will it make being on the \
open plain or not?\" \"For all that,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I entreat thee, \
Sancho, to keep a good heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.\" \
\"I will, please God,\" answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side of \
the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving lights might \
be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty encamisados, all on \
horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the awe-inspiring aspect of \
whom completely extinguished the courage of Sancho, who began to chatter with \
his teeth like one in the cold fit of an ague; and his heart sank and his \
teeth chattered still more when they perceived distinctly that behind them \
there came a litter covered over with black and followed by six more mounted \
figures in mourning down to the very feet of their mules--for they could \
perceive plainly they were not horses by the easy pace at which they went. \
And as the encamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low \
plaintive tone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary \
place was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho's heart, and even into \
his master's; and (save in Don Quixote's case) did so, for all Sancho's \
resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite with his master, \
whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him vividly as one of \
the adventures of his books. He took it into his head that the litter was a \
bier on which was borne some sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom \
was a task reserved for him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid \
his lance in rest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant \
spirit and bearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the \
encamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at hand \
he raised his voice and said: \"Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and \
render me account of who ye are, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye \
carry upon that bier, for, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some \
wrong or some wrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary \
that I should know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done, \
or else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon \
you.\" \"We are in haste,\" answered one of the encamisados, \"and the inn is \
far off, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;\" \
and spurring his mule he moved on. Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this \
answer, and seizing the mule by the bridle he said, \"Halt, and be more \
mannerly, and render an account of what I have asked of you; else, take my \
defiance to combat, all of you.\" The mule was shy, and was so frightened at \
her bridle being seized that rearing up she flung her rider to the ground \
over her haunches. An attendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, \
began to abuse Don Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, \
laying his lance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him \
badly wounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the \
agility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for it \
seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so lightly and \
proudly did he bear himself. The encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed, \
so they speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across \
the plain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers running on \
some gala or festival night. The mourners, too, enveloped and swathed in \
their skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir themselves, and so with entire \
safety to himself Don Quixote belaboured them all and drove them off against \
their will, for they all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to \
carry away the dead body they had in the litter. Sancho beheld all this in \
astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord, and said to himself, \"Clearly \
this master of mine is as bold and valiant as he says he is.\" A burning \
torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had thrown, by the \
light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming up to him he presented \
the point of the lance to his face, calling on him to yield himself prisoner, \
or else he would kill him; to which the prostrate man replied, \"I am \
prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir, for one of my legs is broken: I \
entreat you, if you be a Christian gentleman, not to kill me, which will be \
committing grave sacrilege, for I am a licentiate and I hold first orders.\" \
\"Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?\" said Don \
Quixote. \"What, senor?\" said the other. \"My bad luck.\" \"Then still worse \
awaits you,\" said Don Quixote, \"if you do not satisfy me as to all I asked \
you at first.\" \"You shall be soon satisfied,\" said the licentiate; \"you \
must know, then, that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only a \
bachelor, and my name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, I come \
from the city of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who fled with \
the torches, and we are going to the city of Segovia accompanying a dead body \
which is in that litter, and is that of a gentleman who died in Baeza, where \
he was interred; and now, as I said, we are taking his bones to their \
burial-place, which is in Segovia, where he was born.\" \"And who killed him?\
\" asked Don Quixote. \"God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,\" \
answered the bachelor. \"In that case,\" said Don Quixote, \"the Lord has \
relieved me of the task of avenging his death had any other slain him; but, \
he who slew him having slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, \
and shrug one's shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I \
would have your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don Quixote \
by name, and it is my business and calling to roam the world righting wrongs \
and redressing injuries.\" \"I do not know how that about righting wrongs can \
be,\" said the bachelor, \"for from straight you have made me crooked, \
leaving me with a broken leg that will never see itself straight again all \
the days of its life; and the injury you have redressed in my case has been \
to leave me injured in such a way that I shall remain injured for ever; and \
the height of misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of \
adventures.\" \"Things do not all happen in the same way,\" answered Don \
Quixote; \"it all came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, \
by night, dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying, covered \
with mourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil and of the \
other world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty in attacking you, and I \
should have attacked you even had I known positively that you were the very \
devils of hell, for such I certainly believed and took you to be.\" \"As my \
fate has so willed it,\" said the bachelor, \"I entreat you, sir \
knight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help me to \
get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between the stirrup \
and the saddle.\" \"I would have talked on till to-morrow,\" said Don \
Quixote; \"how long were you going to wait before telling me of your \
distress?\" He at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, \
as he was just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden with \
provender, which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sancho made a \
bag of his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and as the bag \
would hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey his master's call, \
and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the mule; then putting him \
on her back he gave him the torch, and Don Quixote bade him follow the track \
of his companions, and beg pardon of them on his part for the wrong which he \
could not help doing them. And said Sancho, \"If by chance these gentlemen \
should want to know who was the hero that served them so, your worship may \
tell them that he is the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called \
the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\" The bachelor then took his departure. \
I forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote, \"Remember \
that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands on a holy thing, \
juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo.\" \"I do not understand that Latin,\" \
answered Don Quixote, \"but I know well I did not lay hands, only this pike; \
besides, I did not think I was committing an assault upon priests or things \
of the Church, which, like a Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I \
respect and revere, but upon phantoms and spectres of the other world; but \
even so, I remember how it fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of \
the ambassador of that king before his Holiness the Pope, who excommunicated \
him for the same; and yet the good Roderick of Vivar bore himself that day \
like a very noble and valiant knight.\" On hearing this the bachelor took his \
departure, as has been said, without making any reply; and Don Quixote asked \
Sancho what had induced him to call him the \"Knight of the Rueful \
Countenance\" more then than at any other time. \"I will tell you,\" answered \
Sancho; \"it was because I have been looking at you for some time by the \
light of the torch held by that unfortunate, and verily your worship has got \
of late the most ill-favoured countenance I ever saw: it must be either owing \
to the fatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth and grinders.\" \
\"It is not that,\" replied Don Quixote, \"but because the sage whose duty it \
will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it proper \
that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore did; one \
being 'He of the Burning Sword,' another 'He of the Unicorn,' this one 'He of \
the Damsels,' that 'He of the Phoenix,' another 'The Knight of the Griffin,' \
and another 'He of the Death,' and by these names and designations they were \
known all the world round; and so I say that the sage aforesaid must have put \
it into your mouth and mind just now to call me 'The Knight of the Rueful \
Countenance,' as I intend to call myself from this day forward; and that the \
said name may fit me better, I mean, when the opportunity offers, to have a \
very rueful countenance painted on my shield.\" \"There is no occasion, \
senor, for wasting time or money on making that countenance,\" said Sancho; \
\"for all that need be done is for your worship to show your own, face to \
face, to those who look at you, and without anything more, either image or \
shield, they will call you 'Him of the Rueful Countenance' and believe me I \
am telling you the truth, for I assure you, senor (and in good part be it \
said), hunger and the loss of your grinders have given you such an \
ill-favoured face that, as I say, the rueful picture may be very well spared.\
\" Don Quixote laughed at Sancho's pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to \
call himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as he had \
devised. Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter \
were bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying: \"Senor, you have \
ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself than any of those I \
have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten and routed, may bethink \
themselves that it is a single man that has beaten them, and feeling sore and \
ashamed of it may take heart and come in search of us and give us trouble \
enough. The ass is in proper trim, the mountains are near at hand, hunger \
presses, we have nothing more to do but make good our retreat, and, as the \
saying is, the dead to the grave and the living to the loaf.\" And driving \
his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who, feeling that Sancho \
was right, did so without replying; and after proceeding some little distance \
between two hills they found themselves in a wide and retired valley, where \
they alighted, and Sancho unloaded his beast, and stretched upon the green \
grass, with hunger for sauce, they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped \
all at once, satisfying their appetites with more than one store of cold meat \
which the dead man's clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short \
allowance) had brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of \
ill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was that \
they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips; and as \
thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where they were was \
full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in the following \
chapter. CHAPTER XX. OF THE UNEXAMPLED AND UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURE WHICH WAS \
ACHIEVED BY THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WITH LESS PERIL THAN ANY \
EVER ACHIEVED BY ANY FAMOUS KNIGHT IN THE WORLD \"It cannot be, senor, but \
that this grass is a proof that there must be hard by some spring or brook to \
give it moisture, so it would be well to move a little farther on, that we \
may find some place where we may quench this terrible thirst that plagues us, \
which beyond a doubt is more distressing than hunger.\" The advice seemed \
good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by the bridle and Sancho the \
ass by the halter, after he had packed away upon him the remains of the \
supper, they advanced the meadow feeling their way, for the darkness of the \
night made it impossible to see anything; but they had not gone two hundred \
paces when a loud noise of water, as if falling from great rocks, struck \
their ears. The sound cheered them greatly; but halting to make out by \
listening from what quarter it came they heard unseasonably another noise \
which spoiled the satisfaction the sound of the water gave them, especially \
for Sancho, who was by nature timid and faint-hearted. They heard, I say, \
strokes falling with a measured beat, and a certain rattling of iron and \
chains that, together with the furious din of the water, would have struck \
terror into any heart but Don Quixote's. The night was, as has been said, \
dark, and they had happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees, whose \
leaves stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; so that, what \
with the solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of the water, and the \
rustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe and dread; more especially as \
they perceived that the strokes did not cease, nor the wind lull, nor morning \
approach; to all which might be added their ignorance as to where they were. \
But Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante, and \
bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, and said, \
\"Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven's will have been born in this our iron \
age to revive revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it is called; I \
am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant deeds are reserved; I \
am, I say again, he who is to revive the Knights of the Round Table, the \
Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and he who is to consign to oblivion \
the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantes and Tirantes, the Phoebuses and \
Belianises, with the whole herd of famous knights-errant of days gone by, \
performing in these in which I live such exploits, marvels, and feats of arms \
as shall obscure their brightest deeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and \
trusty squire, the gloom of this night, its strange silence, the dull \
confused murmur of those trees, the awful sound of that water in quest of \
which we came, that seems as though it were precipitating and dashing itself \
down from the lofty mountains of the Moon, and that incessant hammering that \
wounds and pains our ears; which things all together and each of itself are \
enough to instil fear, dread, and dismay into the breast of Mars himself, \
much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of the kind. Well, \
then, all this that I put before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my \
spirit, making my heart burst in my bosom through eagerness to engage in this \
adventure, arduous as it promises to be; therefore tighten Rocinante's girths \
a little, and God be with thee; wait for me here three days and no more, and \
if in that time I come not back, thou canst return to our village, and \
thence, to do me a favour and a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, where \
thou shalt say to my incomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knight hath \
died in attempting things that might make him worthy of being called hers.\" \
When Sancho heard his master's words he began to weep in the most pathetic \
way, saying: \"Senor, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so \
dreadful adventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turn \
about and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don't drink for three days \
to come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will there be anyone \
to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a time heard the curate of \
our village, whom your worship knows well, preach that he who seeks danger \
perishes in it; so it is not right to tempt God by trying so tremendous a \
feat from which there can be no escape save by a miracle, and Heaven has \
performed enough of them for your worship in delivering you from being \
blanketed as I was, and bringing you out victorious and safe and sound from \
among all those enemies that were with the dead man; and if all this does not \
move or soften that hard heart, let this thought and reflection move it, that \
you will have hardly quitted this spot when from pure fear I shall yield my \
soul up to anyone that will take it. I left home and wife and children to \
come and serve your worship, trusting to do better and not worse; but as \
covetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder, for just as I had \
them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island your worship has so \
often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu of it you mean to desert me \
now in a place so far from human reach: for God's sake, master mine, deal not \
so unjustly by me, and if your worship will not entirely give up attempting \
this feat, at least put it off till morning, for by what the lore I learned \
when I was a shepherd tells me it cannot want three hours of dawn now, \
because the mouth of the Horn is overhead and makes midnight in the line of \
the left arm.\" \"How canst thou see, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"where it \
makes that line, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, \
when the night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole \
heaven?\" \"That's true,\" said Sancho, \"but fear has sharp eyes, and sees \
things underground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason \
to show that it now wants but little of day.\" \"Let it want what it may,\" \
replied Don Quixote, \"it shall not be said of me now or at any time that \
tears or entreaties turned me aside from doing what was in accordance with \
knightly usage; and so I beg of thee, Sancho, to hold thy peace, for God, who \
has put it into my heart to undertake now this so unexampled and terrible \
adventure, will take care to watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; \
what thou hast to do is to tighten Rocinante's girths well, and wait here, \
for I shall come back shortly, alive or dead.\" Sancho perceiving it his \
master's final resolve, and how little his tears, counsels, and entreaties \
prevailed with him, determined to have recourse to his own ingenuity and \
compel him, if he could, to wait till daylight; and so, while tightening the \
girths of the horse, he quietly and without being felt, with his ass' halter \
tied both Rocinante's legs, so that when Don Quixote strove to go he was \
unable as the horse could only move by jumps. Seeing the success of his \
trick, Sancho Panza said: \"See there, senor! Heaven, moved by my tears and \
prayers, has so ordered it that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be \
obstinate, and spur and strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, \
as they say, against the pricks.\" Don Quixote at this grew desperate, but \
the more he drove his heels into the horse, the less he stirred him; and not \
having any suspicion of the tying, he was fain to resign himself and wait \
till daybreak or until Rocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this \
came of something other than Sancho's ingenuity. So he said to him, \"As it \
is so, Sancho, and as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait till dawn \
smiles upon us, even though I weep while it delays its coming.\" \"There is \
no need to weep,\" answered Sancho, \"for I will amuse your worship by \
telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you like to dismount \
and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after the fashion of \
knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes and the moment arrives for \
attempting this extraordinary adventure you are looking forward to.\" \"What \
art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?\" said Don Quixote. \"Am \
I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take their rest in the presence \
of danger? Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do as thou wilt, for I will \
act as I think most consistent with my character.\" \"Be not angry, master \
mine,\" replied Sancho, \"I did not mean to say that;\" and coming close to \
him he laid one hand on the pommel of the saddle and the other on the cantle \
so that he held his master's left thigh in his embrace, not daring to \
separate a finger's width from him; so much afraid was he of the strokes \
which still resounded with a regular beat. Don Quixote bade him tell some \
story to amuse him as he had proposed, to which Sancho replied that he would \
if his dread of what he heard would let him; \"Still,\" said he, \"I will \
strive to tell a story which, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody \
interferes with the telling, is the best of stories, and let your worship \
give me your attention, for here I begin. What was, was; and may the good \
that is to come be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for \
it--your worship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to \
their tales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of Cato \
Zonzorino the Roman, that says 'the evil for him that goes to look for it,' \
and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to show that your \
worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any quarter, and \
that we should go back by some other road, since nobody forces us to follow \
this in which so many terrors affright us.\" \"Go on with thy story, \
Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and leave the choice of our road to my care.\" \
\"I say then,\" continued Sancho, \"that in a village of Estremadura there \
was a goat-shepherd--that is to say, one who tended goats--which shepherd or \
goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this Lope Ruiz was in \
love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdess called Torralva \
was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this rich grazier-\" \"If that is the \
way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"repeating twice all \
thou hast to say, thou wilt not have done these two days; go straight on with \
it, and tell it like a reasonable man, or else say nothing.\" \"Tales are \
always told in my country in the very way I am telling this,\" answered \
Sancho, \"and I cannot tell it in any other, nor is it right of your worship \
to ask me to make new customs.\" \"Tell it as thou wilt,\" replied Don \
Quixote; \"and as fate will have it that I cannot help listening to thee, go \
on.\" \"And so, lord of my soul,\" continued Sancho, as I have said, this \
shepherd was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild buxom lass \
with something of the look of a man about her, for she had little moustaches; \
I fancy I see her now.\" \"Then you knew her?\" said Don Quixote. \"I did not \
know her,\" said Sancho, \"but he who told me the story said it was so true \
and certain that when I told it to another I might safely declare and swear I \
had seen it all myself. And so in course of time, the devil, who never sleeps \
and puts everything in confusion, contrived that the love the shepherd bore \
the shepherdess turned into hatred and ill-will, and the reason, according to \
evil tongues, was some little jealousy she caused him that crossed the line \
and trespassed on forbidden ground; and so much did the shepherd hate her \
from that time forward that, in order to escape from her, he determined to \
quit the country and go where he should never set eyes on her again. \
Torralva, when she found herself spurned by Lope, was immediately smitten \
with love for him, though she had never loved him before.\" \"That is the \
natural way of women,\" said Don Quixote, \"to scorn the one that loves them, \
and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.\" \"It came to pass,\" said \
Sancho, \"that the shepherd carried out his intention, and driving his goats \
before him took his way across the plains of Estremadura to pass over into \
the Kingdom of Portugal. Torralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on \
foot and barefoot followed him at a distance, with a pilgrim's staff in her \
hand and a scrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit of \
looking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of paint for \
her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going to trouble myself to \
prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say, came with his flock to \
cross over the river Guadiana, which was at that time swollen and almost \
overflowing its banks, and at the spot he came to there was neither ferry nor \
boat nor anyone to carry him or his flock to the other side, at which he was \
much vexed, for he perceived that Torralva was approaching and would give him \
great annoyance with her tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about \
so closely that he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so \
small that it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he \
spoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred goats \
across. The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over; he came \
back and carried another over; he came back again, and again brought over \
another--let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking \
across, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story, and \
it will be impossible to tell another word of it. To proceed, I must tell you \
the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery, and the fisherman \
lost a great deal of time in going and coming; still he returned for another \
goat, and another, and another.\" \"Take it for granted he brought them all \
across,\" said Don Quixote, \"and don't keep going and coming in this way, or \
thou wilt not make an end of bringing them over this twelvemonth.\" \"How \
many have gone across so far?\" said Sancho. \"How the devil do I know?\" \
replied Don Quixote. \"There it is,\" said Sancho, \"what I told you, that \
you must keep a good count; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, \
for there is no going any farther.\" \"How can that be?\" said Don Quixote; \
\"is it so essential to the story to know to a nicety the goats that have \
crossed over, that if there be a mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst \
not go on with it?\" \"No, senor, not a bit,\" replied Sancho; \"for when I \
asked your worship to tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered \
you did not know, at that very instant all I had to say passed away out of my \
memory, and, faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.\" \"So, \
then,\" said Don Quixote, \"the story has come to an end?\" \"As much as my \
mother has,\" said Sancho. \"In truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou hast told \
one of the rarest stories, tales, or histories, that anyone in the world \
could have imagined, and such a way of telling it and ending it was never \
seen nor will be in a lifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy \
excellent understanding. But I do not wonder, for perhaps those ceaseless \
strokes may have confused thy wits.\" \"All that may be,\" replied Sancho, \
\"but I know that as to my story, all that can be said is that it ends there \
where the mistake in the count of the passage of the goats begins.\" \"Let it \
end where it will, well and good,\" said Don Quixote, \"and let us see if \
Rocinante can go;\" and again he spurred him, and again Rocinante made jumps \
and remained where he was, so well tied was he. Just then, whether it was the \
cold of the morning that was now approaching, or that he had eaten something \
laxative at supper, or that it was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho \
felt a desire to do what no one could do for him; but so great was the fear \
that had penetrated his heart, he dared not separate himself from his master \
by as much as the black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was, \
however, also impossible; so what he did for peace's sake was to remove his \
right hand, which held the back of the saddle, and with it to untie gently \
and silently the running string which alone held up his breeches, so that on \
loosening it they at once fell down round his feet like fetters; he then \
raised his shirt as well as he could and bared his hind quarters, no slim \
ones. But, this accomplished, which he fancied was all he had to do to get \
out of this terrible strait and embarrassment, another still greater \
difficulty presented itself, for it seemed to him impossible to relieve \
himself without making some noise, and he ground his teeth and squeezed his \
shoulders together, holding his breath as much as he could; but in spite of \
his precautions he was unlucky enough after all to make a little noise, very \
different from that which was causing him so much fear. Don Quixote, hearing \
it, said, \"What noise is that, Sancho?\" \"I don't know, senor,\" said he; \
\"it must be something new, for adventures and misadventures never begin with \
a trifle.\" Once more he tried his luck, and succeeded so well, that without \
any further noise or disturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that \
had given him so much discomfort. But as Don Quixote's sense of smell was as \
acute as his hearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him that the \
fumes rose almost in a straight line, it could not be but that some should \
reach his nose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief by compressing \
it between his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone, \"Sancho, it \
strikes me thou art in great fear.\" \"I am,\" answered Sancho; \"but how \
does your worship perceive it now more than ever?\" \"Because just now thou \
smellest stronger than ever, and not of ambergris,\" answered Don Quixote. \
\"Very likely,\" said Sancho, \"but that's not my fault, but your worship's, \
for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces.\" \
\"Then go back three or four, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, all the time \
with his fingers to his nose; \"and for the future pay more attention to thy \
person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great familiarity with \
thee that has bred this contempt.\" \"I'll bet,\" replied Sancho, \"that your \
worship thinks I have done something I ought not with my person.\" \"It makes \
it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote. With this and \
other talk of the same sort master and man passed the night, till Sancho, \
perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very cautiously untied \
Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon as Rocinante found himself free, \
though by nature he was not at all mettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and \
began pawing--for as to capering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it \
meant. Don Quixote, then, observing that Rocinante could move, took it as a \
good sign and a signal that he should attempt the dread adventure. By this \
time day had fully broken and everything showed distinctly, and Don Quixote \
saw that he was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep \
shade; he perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, but \
could not discover what caused it, and so without any further delay he let \
Rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, he told him to \
wait for him there three days at most, as he had said before, and if he \
should not have returned by that time, he might feel sure it had been God's \
will that he should end his days in that perilous adventure. He again \
repeated the message and commission with which he was to go on his behalf to \
his lady Dulcinea, and said he was not to be uneasy as to the payment of his \
services, for before leaving home he had made his will, in which he would \
find himself fully recompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to \
the time he had served; but if God delivered him safe, sound, and unhurt out \
of that danger, he might look upon the promised island as much more than \
certain. Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affecting words of \
his good master, and resolved to stay with him until the final issue and end \
of the business. From these tears and this honourable resolve of Sancho \
Panza's the author of this history infers that he must have been of good \
birth and at least an old Christian; and the feeling he displayed touched his \
but not so much as to make him show any weakness; on the contrary, hiding \
what he felt as well as he could, he began to move towards that quarter \
whence the sound of the water and of the strokes seemed to come. Sancho \
followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was, his ass, his \
constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing some distance \
through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little meadow at the foot \
of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of water flung itself. At the \
foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed houses looking more like ruins \
than houses, from among which came, they perceived, the din and clatter of \
blows, which still continued without intermission. Rocinante took fright at \
the noise of the water and of the blows, but quieting him Don Quixote \
advanced step by step towards the houses, commending himself with all his \
heart to his lady, imploring her support in that dread pass and enterprise, \
and on the way commending himself to God, too, not to forget him. Sancho who \
never quitted his side, stretched his neck as far as he could and peered \
between the legs of Rocinante to see if he could now discover what it was \
that caused him such fear and apprehension. They went it might be a hundred \
paces farther, when on turning a corner the true cause, beyond the \
possibility of any mistake, of that dread-sounding and to them awe-inspiring \
noise that had kept them all the night in such fear and perplexity, appeared \
plain and obvious; and it was (if, reader, thou art not disgusted and \
disappointed) six fulling hammers which by their alternate strokes made all \
the din. When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid \
from head to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent down \
upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced at Sancho \
and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of laughter, and \
evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his vexation he could not \
help laughing at the sight of him; and when Sancho saw his master begin he \
let go so heartily that he had to hold his sides with both hands to keep \
himself from bursting with laughter. Four times he stopped, and as many times \
did his laughter break out afresh with the same violence as at first, whereat \
Don Quixote grew furious, above all when he heard him say mockingly, \"Thou \
must know, friend Sancho, that of Heaven's will I was born in this our iron \
age to revive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved \
perils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;\" and here he went on repeating \
the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard the awful \
strokes. Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule, \
was so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two such \
blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had caught them \
on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed to his \
heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest for his \
jest, and fearing his master might carry it still further, said to him very \
humbly, \"Calm yourself, sir, for by God I am only joking.\" \"Well, then, if \
you are joking I am not,\" replied Don Quixote. \"Look here, my lively \
gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers, had been some perilous \
adventure, have I not, think you, shown the courage required for the attempt \
and achievement? Am I, perchance, being, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know \
and distinguish sounds and tell whether they come from fulling mills or not; \
and that, when perhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as \
you have, low boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them? But \
turn me these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, one by \
one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels, then make \
what mockery you like of me.\" \"No more of that, senor,\" returned Sancho; \
\"I own I went a little too far with the joke. But tell me, your worship, now \
that peace is made between us (and may God bring you out of all the \
adventures that may befall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of \
this one), was it not a thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the \
great fear we were in?--at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see \
now that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay is.\" \"I \
do not deny,\" said Don Quixote, \"that what happened to us may be worth \
laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is not everyone \
that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.\" \"At any rate,\" \
said Sancho, \"your worship knew how to hit the right point with your pike, \
aiming at my head and hitting me on the shoulders, thanks be to God and my \
own smartness in dodging it. But let that pass; all will come out in the \
scouring; for I have heard say 'he loves thee well that makes thee weep;' and \
moreover that it is the way with great lords after any hard words they give a \
servant to give him a pair of breeches; though I do not know what they give \
after blows, unless it be that knights-errant after blows give islands, or \
kingdoms on the mainland.\" \"It may be on the dice,\" said Don Quixote, \
\"that all thou sayest will come true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd \
enough to know that our first movements are not in our own control; and one \
thing for the future bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity \
in my company; for in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and they \
are innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his lord as \
thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault of thine and of \
mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect for me; of mine, that I do \
not make myself more respected. There was Gandalin, the squire of Amadis of \
Gaul, that was Count of the Insula Firme, and we read of him that he always \
addressed his lord with his cap in his hand, his head bowed down and his body \
bent double, more turquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal, the \
squire of Galaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the \
greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in \
the whole of that history, as long as it is truthful? From all I have said \
thou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference between master and \
man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: so that from this \
day forward in our intercourse we must observe more respect and take less \
liberties, for in whatever way I may be provoked with you it will be bad for \
the pitcher. The favours and benefits that I have promised you will come in \
due time, and if they do not your wages at least will not be lost, as I have \
already told you.\" \"All that your worship says is very well,\" said Sancho, \
\"but I should like to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and \
it might be necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a \
knight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by the \
day like bricklayers?\" \"I do not believe,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that \
such squires were ever on wages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have \
now mentioned thine in the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a \
view to what may happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in \
these wretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles \
in the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in this there is \
no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.\" \"That is true,\" \
said Sancho, \"since the mere noise of the hammers of a fulling mill can \
disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant errant adventurer as your \
worship; but you may be sure I will not open my lips henceforward to make \
light of anything of your worship's, but only to honour you as my master and \
natural lord.\" \"By so doing,\" replied Don Quixote, \"shalt thou live long \
on the face of the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as \
though they were parents.\" CHAPTER XXI. WHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED \
ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO'S HELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS \
THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE KNIGHT It now began to rain a little, and \
Sancho was for going into the fulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken such \
an abhorrence to them on account of the late joke that he would not enter \
them on any account; so turning aside to right they came upon another road, \
different from that which they had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards \
Don Quixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head something that \
shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said: \"I \
think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims drawn \
from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially that one \
that says, 'Where one door shuts, another opens.' I say so because if last \
night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were looking for against us, \
cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens wide another one for another \
better and more certain adventure, and if I do not contrive to enter it, it \
will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, \
or the darkness of the night. I say this because, if I mistake not, there \
comes towards us one who wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning \
which I took the oath thou rememberest.\" \"Mind what you say, your worship, \
and still more what you do,\" said Sancho, \"for I don't want any more \
fulling mills to finish off fulling and knocking our senses out.\" \"The \
devil take thee, man,\" said Don Quixote; \"what has a helmet to do with \
fulling mills?\" \"I don't know,\" replied Sancho, \"but, faith, if I might \
speak as I used, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would \
see you were mistaken in what you say.\" \"How can I be mistaken in what I \
say, unbelieving traitor?\" returned Don Quixote; \"tell me, seest thou not \
yonder knight coming towards us on a dappled grey steed, who has upon his \
head a helmet of gold?\" \"What I see and make out,\" answered Sancho, \"is \
only a man on a grey ass like my own, who has something that shines on his \
head.\" \"Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino,\" said Don Quixote; \"stand \
to one side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a \
word, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess \
myself of the helmet I have so longed for.\" \"I will take care to stand \
aside,\" said Sancho; \"but God grant, I say once more, that it may be \
marjoram and not fulling mills.\" \"I have told thee, brother, on no account \
to mention those fulling mills to me again,\" said Don Quixote, \"or I \
vow--and I say no more-I'll full the soul out of you.\" Sancho held his peace \
in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like a bowl \
at him. The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that \
Don Quixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two villages, one \
of them so small that it had neither apothecary's shop nor barber, which the \
other that was close to it had, so the barber of the larger served the \
smaller, and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and another \
man who wanted to be shaved, and on this errand the barber was going, \
carrying with him a brass basin; but as luck would have it, as he was on the \
way it began to rain, and not to spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, \
he put the basin on his head, and being clean it glittered at half a league's \
distance. He rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it \
seem to Don Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden \
helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and \
ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near, without \
entering into any parley with him, at Rocinante's top speed he bore down upon \
him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him through and \
through, and as he reached him, without checking the fury of his charge, he \
cried to him: \"Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own \
accord that which is so reasonably my due.\" The barber, who without any \
expectation or apprehension of it saw this apparition coming down upon him, \
had no other way of saving himself from the stroke of the lance but to let \
himself fall off his ass; and no sooner had he touched the ground than he \
sprang up more nimbly than a deer and sped away across the plain faster than \
the wind. He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented \
himself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the \
beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off with \
its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it is pursued. He \
told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands said: \"By \
God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is worth a \
maravedis,\" and handed it to his master, who immediately put it on his head, \
turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of fitment, and not \
finding it he said, \"Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous \
head-piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the worst of \
it is half of it is wanting.\" When Sancho heard him call the basin a \
headpiece he was unable to restrain his laughter, but remembering his \
master's wrath he checked himself in the midst of it. \"What art thou \
laughing at, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote. \"I am laughing,\" said he, \"to \
think of the great head the pagan must have had who owned this helmet, for it \
looks exactly like a regular barber's basin.\" \"Dost thou know what I \
suspect, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote; \"that this wonderful piece of this \
enchanted helmet must by some strange accident have come into the hands of \
some one who was unable to recognise or realise its value, and who, not \
knowing what he did, and seeing it to be of the purest gold, must have melted \
down one half for the sake of what it might be worth, and of the other made \
this which is like a barber's basin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to \
me who recognise it, its transformation makes no difference, for I will set \
it to rights at the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such \
style that that helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles \
shall not surpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will wear \
it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the more as it \
will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone.\" \"That \
is,\" said Sancho, \"if it is not shot with a sling as they were in the \
battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your worship's \
grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that made me vomit \
my bowels up.\" \"It does not grieve me much to have lost it,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"for thou knowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.\" \
\"So have I,\" answered Sancho, \"but if ever I make it, or try it again as \
long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no intention of \
putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with all my five senses, \
to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as to being \
blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to prevent mishaps of that \
sort, and if they come there is nothing for it but to squeeze our shoulders \
together, hold our breath, shut our eyes, and let ourselves go where luck and \
the blanket may send us.\" \"Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,\" said Don \
Quixote on hearing this, \"for once an injury has been done thee thou never \
forgettest it: but know that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not \
to attach importance to trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what \
broken rib, what cracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jest \
and sport it was, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that light I \
would have returned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks \
did for the rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now, or if my Dulcinea had \
lived then, might depend upon it she would not be so famous for her beauty as \
she is;\" and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said Sancho, \"Let \
it pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest, but I know what sort \
of jest and earnest it was, and I know it will never be rubbed out of my \
memory any more than off my shoulders. But putting that aside, will your \
worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like \
a grey ass, which that Martino that your worship overthrew has left deserted \
here? for, from the way he took to his heels and bolted, he is not likely \
ever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one.\" \"I \
have never been in the habit,\" said Don Quixote, \"of taking spoil of those \
whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away their horses \
and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the victor have lost \
his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to take that of the \
vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore, Sancho, leave this horse, \
or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be; for when its owner sees us gone \
hence he will come back for it.\" \"God knows I should like to take it,\" \
returned Sancho, \"or at least to change it for my own, which does not seem \
to me as good a one: verily the laws of chivalry are strict, since they \
cannot be stretched to let one ass be changed for another; I should like to \
know if I might at least change trappings.\" \"On that head I am not quite \
certain,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and the matter being doubtful, pending \
better information, I say thou mayest change them, if so be thou hast urgent \
need of them.\" \"So urgent is it,\" answered Sancho, \"that if they were for \
my own person I could not want them more;\" and forthwith, fortified by this \
licence, he effected the mutatio capparum, rigging out his beast to the \
ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done, they broke \
their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter \
mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills, without \
casting a look in that direction, in such loathing did they hold them for the \
alarm they had caused them; and, all anger and gloom removed, they mounted \
and, without taking any fixed road (not to fix upon any being the proper \
thing for true knights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante's will, \
which carried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass, \
which always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably; \
nevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a venture \
without any other aim. As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to \
his master, \"Senor, would your worship give me leave to speak a little to \
you? For since you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things \
have gone to rot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of my \
tongue that I don't want to be spoiled.\" \"Say, on, Sancho,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"and be brief in thy discourse, for there is no pleasure in one \
that is long.\" \"Well then, senor,\" returned Sancho, \"I say that for some \
days past I have been considering how little is got or gained by going in \
search of these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and \
cross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved, \
there is no one to see or know of them, and so they must be left untold for \
ever, to the loss of your worship's object and the credit they deserve; \
therefore it seems to me it would be better (saving your worship's better \
judgment) if we were to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who \
may have some war on hand, in whose service your worship may prove the worth \
of your person, your great might, and greater understanding, on perceiving \
which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward us, \
each according to his merits; and there you will not be at a loss for some \
one to set down your achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory \
for ever. Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely \
limits, though I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry to \
write the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out.\" \
\"Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"but before that \
point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on probation, \
seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name and fame may be \
acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the court of some great \
monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds, and that the boys, the \
instant they see him enter the gate of the city, may all follow him and \
surround him, crying, 'This is the Knight of the Sun'-or the Serpent, or any \
other title under which he may have achieved great deeds. 'This,' they will \
say, 'is he who vanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty \
strength; he who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the long \
enchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred years.' So from \
one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements; and presently at \
the tumult of the boys and the others the king of that kingdom will appear at \
the windows of his royal palace, and as soon as he beholds the knight, \
recognising him by his arms and the device on his shield, he will as a matter \
of course say, 'What ho! Forth all ye, the knights of my court, to receive \
the flower of chivalry who cometh hither!' At which command all will issue \
forth, and he himself, advancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him \
closely, and salute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to \
the queen's chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her \
daughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished damsels that \
could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the known world. \
Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her eyes upon the knight \
and he his upon her, and each will seem to the other something more divine \
than human, and, without knowing how or why they will be taken and entangled \
in the inextricable toils of love, and sorely distressed in their hearts not \
to see any way of making their pains and sufferings known by speech. Thence \
they will lead him, no doubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, \
where, having removed his armour, they will bring him a rich mantle of \
scarlet wherewith to robe himself, and if he looked noble in his armour he \
will look still more so in a doublet. When night comes he will sup with the \
king, queen, and princess; and all the time he will never take his eyes off \
her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and she will do \
the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a damsel of \
great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through the door of the \
hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf followed by a fair dame, \
between two giants, who comes with a certain adventure, the work of an \
ancient sage; and he who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight in \
the world. \"The king will then command all those present to essay it, and \
none will bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the \
great enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed and \
will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her \
thoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince, or \
whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful as \
himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his court, \
requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war. The king will \
grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his hands for the \
favour done to him; and that night he will take leave of his lady the \
princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a \
garden, and at which he has already many times conversed with her, the \
go-between and confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the \
princess. He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much \
distressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady he \
would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come to \
herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the knight, \
who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing them with his \
tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to inform each other of \
their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will entreat him to make his \
absence as short as possible, which he will promise to do with many oaths; \
once more he kisses her hands, and takes his leave in such grief that he is \
well-nigh ready to die. He betakes him thence to his chamber, flings himself \
on his bed, cannot sleep for sorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, \
goes to take leave of the king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his \
leave of the pair, it is told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot \
receive a visit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his \
heart is pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. The \
confidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her mistress, who listens \
with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is not knowing who \
this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or not; the damsel \
assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness, and gallantry of bearing as \
her knight possesses could not exist in any save one who was royal and \
illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and she strives to be of good \
cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her parents, and at the end of two \
days she appears in public. Meanwhile the knight has taken his departure; he \
fights in the war, conquers the king's enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in \
many battles, returns to the court, sees his lady where he was wont to see \
her, and it is agreed that he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as \
the reward of his services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows \
not who he is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way \
it may be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to regard \
it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is proved to be \
the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not what, for I fancy it is \
not likely to be on the map. The father dies, the princess inherits, and in \
two words the knight becomes king. And here comes in at once the bestowal of \
rewards upon his squire and all who have aided him in rising to so exalted a \
rank. He marries his squire to a damsel of the princess's, who will be, no \
doubt, the one who was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very \
great duke.\" \"That's what I want, and no mistake about it!\" said Sancho. \
\"That's what I'm waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for \
your worship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\" \
\"Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for in the same \
manner, and by the same steps as I have described here, knights-errant rise \
and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we want now is to find out what \
king, Christian or pagan, is at war and has a beautiful daughter; but there \
will be time enough to think of that, for, as I have told thee, fame must be \
won in other quarters before repairing to the court. There is another thing, \
too, that is wanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a \
beautiful daughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the \
universe, I know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or \
even second cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to give me \
his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this \
point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that by this \
deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned. True it is I am \
a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, and entitled to the five \
hundred sueldos mulct; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history \
will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree that I may find myself fifth or \
sixth in descent from a king; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that there \
are two kinds of lineages in the world; some there be tracing and deriving \
their descent from kings and princes, whom time has reduced little by little \
until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring \
from the common herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be \
great lords; so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer \
are, and the others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of such \
that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with which the \
king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied; and should he \
not be, the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to be \
the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her lord and husband in \
spite of her father; if not, then it comes to seizing her and carrying her \
off where I please; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her \
parents.\" \"It comes to this, too,\" said Sancho, \"what some naughty people \
say, 'Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;' though it would \
fit better to say, 'A clear escape is better than good men's prayers.' I say \
so because if my lord the king, your worship's father-in-law, will not \
condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing for it but, as \
your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But the mischief is that \
until peace is made and you come into the peaceful enjoyment of your kingdom, \
the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards go, unless it be that the \
confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes with the princess, and that \
with her he tides over his bad luck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for \
his master, I suppose, may as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife.\
\" \"Nobody can object to that,\" said Don Quixote. \"Then since that may be,\
\" said Sancho, \"there is nothing for it but to commend ourselves to God, \
and let fortune take what course it will.\" \"God guide it according to my \
wishes and thy wants,\" said Don Quixote, \"and mean be he who thinks himself \
mean.\" \"In God's name let him be so,\" said Sancho: \"I am an old \
Christian, and to fit me for a count that's enough.\" \"And more than enough \
for thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"and even wert thou not, it would make no \
difference, because I being the king can easily give thee nobility without \
purchase or service rendered by thee, for when I make thee a count, then thou \
art at once a gentleman; and they may say what they will, but by my faith \
they will have to call thee 'your lordship,' whether they like it or not.\" \
\"Not a doubt of it; and I'll know how to support the tittle,\" said Sancho. \
\"Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,\" said his master. \"So be it,\" \
answered Sancho. \"I say I will know how to behave, for once in my life I was \
beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat so well on me that all \
said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same brotherhood. What will it \
be, then, when I put a duke's robe on my back, or dress myself in gold and \
pearls like a count? I believe they'll come a hundred leagues to see me.\" \
\"Thou wilt look well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must shave thy beard \
often, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou dost not \
shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou art at the \
distance of a musket shot.\" \"What more will it be,\" said Sancho, \"than \
having a barber, and keeping him at wages in the house? and even if it be \
necessary, I will make him go behind me like a nobleman's equerry.\" \"Why, \
how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?\" asked Don \
Quixote. \"I will tell you,\" answered Sancho. \"Years ago I was for a month \
at the capital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they \
said was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in every turn \
he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man did not join the \
other man, instead of always going behind him; they answered me that he was \
his equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to have such persons \
behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have never forgotten it.\" \
\"Thou art right,\" said Don Quixote, \"and in the same way thou mayest carry \
thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all together, nor \
were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the first count to have a \
barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one's beard is a greater trust \
than saddling one's horse.\" \"Let the barber business be my look-out,\" said \
Sancho; \"and your worship's be it to strive to become a king, and make me a \
count.\" \"So it shall be,\" answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he \
saw what will be told in the following chapter. CHAPTER XXII. OF THE FREEDOM \
DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHO AGAINST THEIR WILL WERE \
BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GO Cide Hamete Benengeli, the Arab \
and Manchegan author, relates in this most grave, high-sounding, minute, \
delightful, and original history that after the discussion between the famous \
Don Quixote of La Mancha and his squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the \
end of chapter twenty-one, Don Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along \
the road he was following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck, \
like beads, on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their hands. With \
them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback \
with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as soon \
as Sancho saw them he said: \"That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to \
the galleys by force of the king's orders.\" \"How by force?\" asked Don \
Quixote; \"is it possible that the king uses force against anyone?\" \"I do \
not say that,\" answered Sancho, \"but that these are people condemned for \
their crimes to serve by force in the king's galleys.\" \"In fact,\" replied \
Don Quixote, \"however it may be, these people are going where they are \
taking them by force, and not of their own will.\" \"Just so,\" said Sancho. \
\"Then if so,\" said Don Quixote, \"here is a case for the exercise of my \
office, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.\" \
\"Recollect, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"Justice, which is the king \
himself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishing \
them for their crimes.\" The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, \
and Don Quixote in very courteous language asked those who were in custody of \
it to be good enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were \
conducting these people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback \
answered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that they \
were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he \
had any business to know. \"Nevertheless,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I should \
like to know from each of them separately the reason of his misfortune;\" to \
this he added more to the same effect to induce them to tell him what he \
wanted so civilly that the other mounted guard said to him: \"Though we have \
here the register and certificate of the sentence of every one of these \
wretches, this is no time to take them out or read them; come and ask \
themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they will, for these fellows \
take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities.\" With this \
permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they not granted it, \
he approached the chain and asked the first for what offences he was now in \
such a sorry case. He made answer that it was for being a lover. \"For that \
only?\" replied Don Quixote; \"why, if for being lovers they send people to \
the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.\" \"The love is not \
the sort your worship is thinking of,\" said the galley slave; \"mine was \
that I loved a washerwoman's basket of clean linen so well, and held it so \
close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law had not forced it from me, I \
should never have let it go of my own will to this moment; I was caught in \
the act, there was no occasion for torture, the case was settled, they \
treated me to a hundred lashes on the back, and three years of gurapas \
besides, and that was the end of it.\" \"What are gurapas?\" asked Don \
Quixote. \"Gurapas are galleys,\" answered the galley slave, who was a young \
man of about four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita. Don \
Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply, so downcast \
and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and said, \"He, sir, \
goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.\" \"What!\" said Don \
Quixote, \"for being musicians and singers are people sent to the galleys \
too?\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered the galley slave, \"for there is nothing worse \
than singing under suffering.\" \"On the contrary, I have heard say,\" said \
Don Quixote, \"that he who sings scares away his woes.\" \"Here it is the \
reverse,\" said the galley slave; \"for he who sings once weeps all his life.\
\" \"I do not understand it,\" said Don Quixote; but one of the guards said \
to him, \"Sir, to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity \
to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the torture and he \
confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is a cattle-stealer, \
and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in the galleys, besides \
two bundred lashes that he has already had on the back; and he is always \
dejected and downcast because the other thieves that were left behind and \
that march here ill-treat, and snub, and jeer, and despise him for confessing \
and not having spirit enough to say nay; for, say they, 'nay' has no more \
letters in it than 'yea,' and a culprit is well off when life or death with \
him depends on his own tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence; and \
to my thinking they are not very far out.\" \"And I think so too,\" answered \
Don Quixote; then passing on to the third he asked him what he had asked the \
others, and the man answered very readily and unconcernedly, \"I am going for \
five years to their ladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats.\" \"I \
will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,\" said Don \
Quixote. \"That,\" said the galley slave, \"is like a man having money at sea \
when he is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say so \
because if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your worship \
now offers me, I would have greased the notary's pen and freshened up the \
attorney's wit with them, so that to-day I should be in the middle of the \
plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this road coupled like a \
greyhound. But God is great; patience--there, that's enough of it.\" Don \
Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a white beard \
falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the reason of his \
being there began to weep without answering a word, but the fifth acted as \
his tongue and said, \"This worthy man is going to the galleys for four \
years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on horseback.\" \"That \
means,\" said Sancho Panza, \"as I take it, to have been exposed to shame in \
public.\" \"Just so,\" replied the galley slave, \"and the offence for which \
they gave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay body-broker; \
I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having besides \
a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.\" \"If that touch had not been \
thrown in,\" said Don Quixote, \"he would not deserve, for mere pimping, to \
row in the galleys, but rather to command and be admiral of them; for the \
office of pimp is no ordinary one, being the office of persons of discretion, \
one very necessary in a well-ordered state, and only to be exercised by \
persons of good birth; nay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of \
them, as in other offices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on \
change; in this way many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by \
this office and calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, \
such as women more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing \
and experience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of \
contrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths, and \
know not which is their right hand. I should like to go farther, and give \
reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those who are to hold so \
necessary an office in the state, but this is not the fit place for it; some \
day I will expound the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it; all \
I say now is, that the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed \
the sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this venerable countenance \
in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp; though I know well \
there are no sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some \
simple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charm that can \
force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is to turn men mad with \
potions and poisons, pretending that they have power to cause love, for, as I \
say, it is an impossibility to compel the will.\" \"It is true,\" said the \
good old man, \"and indeed, sir, as far as the charge of sorcery goes I was \
not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I cannot deny it; but I never thought \
I was doing any harm by it, for my only object was that all the world should \
enjoy itself and live in peace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but \
my good intentions were unavailing to save me from going where I never expect \
to come back from, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment \
that never gives me a moment's ease;\" and again he fell to weeping as \
before, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a real \
of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms. Don Quixote went on and \
asked another what his crime was, and the man answered with no less but \
rather much more sprightliness than the last one. \"I am here because I \
carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of mine, and with a couple \
of other cousins who were none of mine; in short, I carried the joke so far \
with them all that it ended in such a complicated increase of kindred that no \
accountant could make it clear: it was all proved against me, I got no \
favour, I had no money, I was near having my neck stretched, they sentenced \
me to the galleys for six years, I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of \
my fault; I am a young man; let life only last, and with that all will come \
right. If you, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay \
it to you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions to him \
to pray for the life and health of your worship, that they may be as long and \
as good as your amiable appearance deserves.\" This one was in the dress of a \
student, and one of the guards said he was a great talker and a very elegant \
Latin scholar. Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable \
fellow, except that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards \
the other. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a \
chain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on his \
neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a \
\"keep-friend\" or \"friend's foot,\" from which hung two irons reaching to \
his waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured by \
a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouth nor \
lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this man carried so many \
more chains than the others. The guard replied that it was because he alone \
had committed more crimes than all the rest put together, and was so daring \
and such a villain, that though they marched him in that fashion they did not \
feel sure of him, but were in dread of his making his escape. \"What crimes \
can he have committed,\" said Don Quixote, \"if they have not deserved a \
heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?\" \"He goes for ten years,\
\" replied the guard, \"which is the same thing as civil death, and all that \
need be said is that this good fellow is the famous Gines de Pasamonte, \
otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.\" \"Gently, senor commissary,\" said \
the galley slave at this, \"let us have no fixing of names or surnames; my \
name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my family name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla \
as you say; let each one mind his own business, and he will be doing \
enough.\" \"Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,\" \
replied the commissary, \"if you don't want me to make you hold your tongue \
in spite of your teeth.\" \"It is easy to see,\" returned the galley slave, \
\"that man goes as God pleases, but some one shall know some day whether I am \
called Ginesillo de Parapilla or not.\" \"Don't they call you so, you liar?\" \
said the guard. \"They do,\" returned Gines, \"but I will make them give over \
calling me so, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If \
you, sir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed you, \
for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives \
of others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I am Gines de \
Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.\" \"He says true,\" said \
the commissary, \"for he has himself written his story as grand as you \
please, and has left the book in the prison in pawn for two hundred reals.\" \
\"And I mean to take it out of pawn,\" said Gines, \"though it were in for \
two hundred ducats.\" \"Is it so good?\" said Don Quixote. \"So good is it,\" \
replied Gines, \"that a fig for 'Lazarillo de Tormes,' and all of that kind \
that have been written, or shall be written compared with it: all I will say \
about it is that it deals with facts, and facts so neat and diverting that no \
lies could match them.\" \"And how is the book entitled?\" asked Don Quixote. \
\"The 'Life of Gines de Pasamonte,'\" replied the subject of it. \"And is it \
finished?\" asked Don Quixote. \"How can it be finished,\" said the other, \
\"when my life is not yet finished? All that is written is from my birth down \
to the point when they sent me to the galleys this last time.\" \"Then you \
have been there before?\" said Don Quixote. \"In the service of God and the \
king I have been there for four years before now, and I know by this time \
what the biscuit and courbash are like,\" replied Gines; \"and it is no great \
grievance to me to go back to them, for there I shall have time to finish my \
book; I have still many things left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there \
is more than enough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to \
write, for I have it by heart.\" \"You seem a clever fellow,\" said Don \
Quixote. \"And an unfortunate one,\" replied Gines, \"for misfortune always \
persecutes good wit.\" \"It persecutes rogues,\" said the commissary. \"I \
told you already to go gently, master commissary,\" said Pasamonte; \"their \
lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us wretches here, but \
to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if not, by the life \
of-never mind-; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come \
out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak \
better; and now let us march on, for we have had quite enough of this \
entertainment.\" The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in \
return for his threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not \
to ill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to \
have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he \
said: \"From all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that \
though they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about \
to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much \
against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one's want of \
courage under torture, that one's want of money, the other's want of \
advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the \
cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your \
side. All which presents itself now to my mind, urging, persuading, and even \
compelling me to demonstrate in your case the purpose for which Heaven sent \
me into the world and caused me to make profession of the order of chivalry \
to which I belong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need \
and under the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark of \
prudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will ask these \
gentlemen, the guards and commissary, to be so good as to release you and let \
you go in peace, as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under \
more favourable circumstances; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves \
of those whom God and nature have made free. Moreover, sirs of the guard,\" \
added Don Quixote, \"these poor fellows have done nothing to you; let each \
answer for his own sins yonder; there is a God in Heaven who will not forget \
to punish the wicked or reward the good; and it is not fitting that honest \
men should be the instruments of punishment to others, they being therein no \
way concerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if you \
comply with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you will not \
voluntarily, this lance and sword together with the might of my arm shall \
compel you to comply with it by force.\" \"Nice nonsense!\" said the \
commissary; \"a fine piece of pleasantry he has come out with at last! He \
wants us to let the king's prisoners go, as if we had any authority to \
release them, or he to order us to do so! Go your way, sir, and good luck to \
you; put that basin straight that you've got on your head, and don't go \
looking for three feet on a cat.\" \"'Tis you that are the cat, rat, and \
rascal,\" replied Don Quixote, and acting on the word he fell upon him so \
suddenly that without giving him time to defend himself he brought him to the \
ground sorely wounded with a lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it \
was the one that had the musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and \
amazed at this unexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on \
horseback seized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked \
Don Quixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it \
would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance before \
them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving to break the \
chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion, that the guards, now \
rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose, now to attack Don \
Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at all that was of any use. \
Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to release Gines de Pasamonte, who \
was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered, and who, \
attacking the prostrate commissary, took from him his sword and the musket, \
with which, aiming at one and levelling at another, he, without ever \
discharging it, drove every one of the guards off the field, for they took to \
flight, as well to escape Pasamonte's musket, as the showers of stones the \
now released galley slaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved \
at the affair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report \
the matter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell \
would at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to his \
master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go into hiding in \
the sierra that was close by. \"That is all very well,\" said Don Quixote, \
\"but I know what must be done now;\" and calling together all the galley \
slaves, who were now running riot, and had stripped the commissary to the \
skin, he collected them round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed \
them as follows: \"To be grateful for benefits received is the part of \
persons of good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God is \
ingratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest proof \
the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire, and it is \
my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I have taken off your \
necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El Toboso, and there \
present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and say to her that \
her knight, he of the Rueful Countenance, sends to commend himself to her; \
and that ye recount to her in full detail all the particulars of this notable \
adventure, up to the recovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye \
may go where ye will, and good fortune attend you.\" Gines de Pasamonte made \
answer for all, saying, \"That which you, sir, our deliverer, demand of us, \
is of all impossibilities the most impossible to comply with, because we \
cannot go together along the roads, but only singly and separate, and each \
one his own way, endeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to \
escape the Holy Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. \
What your worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service and \
tribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of \
ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship's intention, and \
this is a condition that can be complied with by night as by day, running or \
resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that we are going now to return \
to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take up our chain and set out for El \
Toboso, is to imagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the \
morning, and to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree.\" \"Then \
by all that's good,\" said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath), \"Don son of a \
bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name is, you will have to \
go yourself alone, with your tail between your legs and the whole chain on \
your back.\" Pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time \
thoroughly convinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he \
had committed such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in \
this fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they began to \
shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite unable to \
protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more heeded the spur \
than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted himself behind his ass, and \
with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that poured on both of them. \
Don Quixote was unable to shield himself so well but that more pebbles than I \
could count struck him full on the body with such force that they brought him \
to the ground; and the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched \
the basin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on his \
shoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost to pieces. They \
then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his armour, and they would \
have stripped off his stockings if his greaves had not prevented them. From \
Sancho they took his coat, leaving him in his shirt-sleeves; and dividing \
among themselves the remaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his \
own way, more solicitous about keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they \
dreaded, than about burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present \
themselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho \
and Don Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping \
head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the storm \
of stones that assailed them was not yet over; Rocinante stretched beside his \
master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone; Sancho \
stripped, and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood; and Don Quixote \
fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he had done so \
much. CHAPTER XXIII. OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE SIERRA MORENA, WHICH \
WAS ONE OF THE RAREST ADVENTURES RELATED IN THIS VERACIOUS HISTORY Seeing \
himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, \"I have always \
heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throw water into the \
sea. If I had believed thy words, I should have avoided this trouble; but it \
is done now, it is only to have patience and take warning for the future.\" \
\"Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,\" returned Sancho; \
\"but, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had believed \
me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be avoided; for I tell you \
chivalry is of no account with the Holy Brotherhood, and they don't care two \
maravedis for all the knights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy \
I hear their arrows whistling past my ears this minute.\" \"Thou art a coward \
by nature, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"but lest thou shouldst say I am \
obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise, this once I will take thy \
advice, and withdraw out of reach of that fury thou so dreadest; but it must \
be on one condition, that never, in life or in death, thou art to say to \
anyone that I retired or withdrew from this danger out of fear, but only in \
compliance with thy entreaties; for if thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie \
therein, and from this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie, \
and say thou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; and \
answer me not again; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing or \
retiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to carry some \
little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand here and await \
alone, not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread, but the brothers \
of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Seven Maccabees, and Castor and \
Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoods in the world.\" \"Senor,\" \
replied Sancho, \"to retire is not to flee, and there is no wisdom in waiting \
when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part of wise men to preserve \
themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk all in one day; and let me tell \
you, though I am a clown and a boor, I have got some notion of what they call \
safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my advice, but mount Rocinante if \
you can, and if not I will help you; and follow me, for my mother-wit tells \
me we have more need of legs than hands just now.\" Don Quixote mounted \
without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on his ass, they entered the \
side of the Sierra Morena, which was close by, as it was Sancho's design to \
cross it entirely and come out again at El Viso or Almodovar del Campo, and \
hide for some days among its crags so as to escape the search of the \
Brotherhood should they come to look for them. He was encouraged in this by \
perceiving that the stock of provisions carried by the ass had come safe out \
of the fray with the galley slaves, a circumstance that he regarded as a \
miracle, seeing how they pillaged and ransacked. That night they reached the \
very heart of the Sierra Morena, where it seemed prudent to Sancho to pass \
the night and even some days, at least as many as the stores he carried might \
last, and so they encamped between two rocks and among some cork trees; but \
fatal destiny, which, according to the opinion of those who have not the \
light of the true faith, directs, arranges, and settles everything in its own \
way, so ordered it that Gines de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who by \
the virtue and madness of Don Quixote had been released from the chain, \
driven by fear of the Holy Brotherhood, which he had good reason to dread, \
resolved to take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fear led him to \
the same spot to which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had been led by theirs, \
just in time to recognise them and leave them to fall asleep: and as the \
wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to evildoing, and immediate \
advantage overcomes all considerations of the future, Gines, who was neither \
grateful nor well-principled, made up his mind to steal Sancho Panza's ass, \
not troubling himself about Rocinante, as being a prize that was no good \
either to pledge or sell. While Sancho slept he stole his ass, and before day \
dawned he was far out of reach. Aurora made her appearance bringing gladness \
to the earth but sadness to Sancho Panza, for he found that his Dapple was \
missing, and seeing himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most \
doleful lament in the world, so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his \
exclamations and heard him saying, \"O son of my bowels, born in my very \
house, my children's plaything, my wife's joy, the envy of my neighbours, \
relief of my burdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with the \
six-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily I met half my charges.\" \
Don Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled Sancho \
with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient, and promising \
to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of five ass-colts that he \
had at home to be given to him. Sancho took comfort at this, dried his tears, \
suppressed his sobs, and returned thanks for the kindness shown him by Don \
Quixote. He on his part was rejoiced to the heart on entering the mountains, \
as they seemed to him to be just the place for the adventures he was in quest \
of. They brought back to his memory the marvellous adventures that had \
befallen knights-errant in like solitudes and wilds, and he went along \
reflecting on these things, so absorbed and carried away by them that he had \
no thought for anything else. Nor had Sancho any other care (now that he \
fancied he was travelling in a safe quarter) than to satisfy his appetite \
with such remains as were left of the clerical spoils, and so he marched \
behind his master laden with what Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and \
packing his paunch, and so long as he could go that way, he would not have \
given a farthing to meet with another adventure. While so engaged he raised \
his eyes and saw that his master had halted, and was trying with the point of \
his pike to lift some bulky object that lay upon the ground, on which he \
hastened to join him and help him if it were needful, and reached him just as \
with the point of the pike he was raising a saddle-pad with a valise attached \
to it, half or rather wholly rotten and torn; but so heavy were they that \
Sancho had to help to take them up, and his master directed him to see what \
the valise contained. Sancho did so with great alacrity, and though the \
valise was secured by a chain and padlock, from its torn and rotten condition \
he was able to see its contents, which were four shirts of fine holland, and \
other articles of linen no less curious than clean; and in a handkerchief he \
found a good lot of gold crowns, and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed: \
\"Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for \
something!\" Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly \
bound; this Don Quixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep \
it for himself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the \
valise of its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Considering \
the whole matter, Don Quixote observed: \"It seems to me, Sancho--and it is \
impossible it can be otherwise-that some strayed traveller must have crossed \
this sierra and been attacked and slain by footpads, who brought him to this \
remote spot to bury him.\" \"That cannot be,\" answered Sancho, \"because if \
they had been robbers they would not have left this money.\" \"Thou art \
right,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I cannot guess or explain what this may \
mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there is anything \
written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what we want to \
know.\" He opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly but \
in a very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sancho might \
hear it, he found that it ran as follows: SONNET Or Love is lacking in \
intelligence, Or to the height of cruelty attains, Or else it is my doom to \
suffer pains Beyond the measure due to my offence. But if Love be a God, it \
follows thence That he knows all, and certain it remains No God loves \
cruelty; then who ordains This penance that enthrals while it torments? It \
were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name; Such evil with such goodness cannot \
live; And against Heaven I dare not charge the blame, I only know it is my \
fate to die. To him who knows not whence his malady A miracle alone a cure \
can give. \"There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme,\" said Sancho, \
\"unless by that clue there's in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole \
matter.\" \"What clue is there?\" said Don Quixote. \"I thought your worship \
spoke of a clue in it,\" said Sancho. \"I only said Chloe,\" replied Don \
Quixote; \"and that no doubt, is the name of the lady of whom the author of \
the sonnet complains; and, faith, he must be a tolerable poet, or I know \
little of the craft.\" \"Then your worship understands rhyming too?\" \"And \
better than thou thinkest,\" replied Don Quixote, \"as thou shalt see when \
thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end to my lady \
Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho, that all or most of \
the knights-errant in days of yore were great troubadours and great \
musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or more properly speaking \
gifts, are the peculiar property of lovers-errant: true it is that the verses \
of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness in them.\" \"Read more, \
your worship,\" said Sancho, \"and you will find something that will \
enlighten us.\" Don Quixote turned the page and said, \"This is prose and \
seems to be a letter.\" \"A correspondence letter, senor?\" \"From the \
beginning it seems to be a love letter,\" replied Don Quixote. \"Then let \
your worship read it aloud,\" said Sancho, \"for I am very fond of love \
matters.\" \"With all my heart,\" said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as \
Sancho had requested him, he found it ran thus: Thy false promise and my sure \
misfortune carry me to a place whence the news of my death will reach thy \
ears before the words of my complaint. Ungrateful one, thou hast rejected me \
for one more wealthy, but not more worthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth \
I should neither envy the fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my \
own. What thy beauty raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee \
to be an angel, by them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hast \
sent war to me, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever \
hidden from thee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I reap \
not a revenge I would not have. When he had finished the letter, Don Quixote \
said, \"There is less to be gathered from this than from the verses, except \
that he who wrote it is some rejected lover;\" and turning over nearly all \
the pages of the book he found more verses and letters, some of which he \
could read, while others he could not; but they were all made up of \
complaints, laments, misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and \
rejections, some rapturous, some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the \
book, Sancho examined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or \
in the pad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he \
did not rip, or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anything \
should escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousness \
excited in him by the discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a \
hundred; and though he found no more booty, he held the blanket flights, \
balsam vomits, stake benedictions, carriers' fisticuffs, missing alforjas, \
stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, and weariness he had endured in the \
service of his good master, cheap at the price; as he considered himself more \
than fully indemnified for all by the payment he received in the gift of the \
treasure-trove. The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious \
to find out who the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the \
sonnet and letter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the \
shirts, that he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty \
of his lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited \
and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire, he saw \
nothing else for it but to push on, taking whatever road Rocinante \
chose--which was where he could make his way--firmly persuaded that among \
these wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure. As he went along, \
then, occupied with these thoughts, he perceived on the summit of a height \
that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and \
from tussock to tussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make out \
he was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs and \
feet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet but so \
ragged that they showed his skin in several places. He was bareheaded, and \
notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed as has been described, the \
Knight of the Rueful Countenance observed and noted all these trifles, and \
though he made the attempt, he was unable to follow him, for it was not \
granted to the feebleness of Rocinante to make way over such rough ground, he \
being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish by nature. Don Quixote at once came \
to the conclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the \
valise, and made up his mind to go in search of him, even though he should \
have to wander a year in those mountains before he found him, and so he \
directed Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain, while he \
himself went by the other, and perhaps by this means they might light upon \
this man who had passed so quickly out of their sight. \"I could not do that,\
\" said Sancho, \"for when I separate from your worship fear at once lays \
hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of panics and fancies; and let what \
I now say be a notice that from this time forth I am not going to stir a \
finger's width from your presence.\" \"It shall be so,\" said he of the \
Rueful Countenance, \"and I am very glad that thou art willing to rely on my \
courage, which will never fail thee, even though the soul in thy body fail \
thee; so come on now behind me slowly as well as thou canst, and make \
lanterns of thine eyes; let us make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we \
shall light upon this man that we saw, who no doubt is no other than the \
owner of what we found.\" To which Sancho made answer, \"Far better would it \
be not to look for him, for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner \
of the money, it is plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, \
that without taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it \
until in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be \
discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it, and then the \
king will hold me harmless.\" \"Thou art wrong there, Sancho,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"for now that we have a suspicion who the owner is, and have him \
almost before us, we are bound to seek him and make restitution; and if we do \
not see him, the strong suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us \
as guilty as if he were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him \
give thee any uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.\" And so \
saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on foot and \
loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they found \
lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by jackdaws, a \
mule saddled and bridled, all which still further strengthened their \
suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the mule and the saddle-pad. \
As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd \
watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared a great number \
of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the goatherd in charge \
of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote called aloud to him and begged \
him to come down to where they stood. He shouted in return, asking what had \
brought them to that spot, seldom or never trodden except by the feet of \
goats, or of the wolves and other wild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in \
return bade him come down, and they would explain all to him. The goatherd \
descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood, he said, \"I will \
wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead in the hollow there, \
and, faith, it has been lying there now these six months; tell me, have you \
come upon its master about here?\" \"We have come upon nobody,\" answered Don \
Quixote, \"nor on anything except a saddle-pad and a little valise that we \
found not far from this.\" \"I found it too,\" said the goatherd, \"but I \
would not lift it nor go near it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged \
with theft, for the devil is crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to \
make one fall without knowing why or wherefore.\" \"That's exactly what I \
say,\" said Sancho; \"I found it too, and I would not go within a stone's \
throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies just as it was, for I don't \
want a dog with a bell.\" \"Tell me, good man,\" said Don Quixote, \"do you \
know who is the owner of this property?\" \"All I can tell you,\" said the \
goatherd, \"is that about six months ago, more or less, there arrived at a \
shepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps, away from this, a youth of well-bred \
appearance and manners, mounted on that same mule which lies dead here, and \
with the same saddle-pad and valise which you say you found and did not \
touch. He asked us what part of this sierra was the most rugged and retired; \
we told him that it was where we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you \
push on half a league farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way \
out; and I am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no \
road or path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our answer \
the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to him, leaving \
us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his question and the \
haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of the sierra; and after \
that we saw him no more, until some days afterwards he crossed the path of \
one of our shepherds, and without saying a word to him, came up to him and \
gave him several cuffs and kicks, and then turned to the ass with our \
provisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried, and having done this \
made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some \
of us goatherds learned this we went in search of him for about two days \
through the most remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found \
him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet us \
with great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face so disfigured and \
burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him but that his clothes, though \
torn, convinced us, from the recollection we had of them, that he was the \
person we were looking for. He saluted us courteously, and in a few \
well-spoken words he told us not to wonder at seeing him going about in this \
guise, as it was binding upon him in order that he might work out a penance \
which for his many sins had been imposed upon him. We asked him to tell us \
who he was, but we were never able to find out from him: we begged of him \
too, when he was in want of food, which he could not do without, to tell us \
where we should find him, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and \
readiness; or if this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of \
us and not take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer, \
begged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to ask it in \
God's name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed abode, he said \
he had no other than that which chance offered wherever night might overtake \
him; and his words ended in an outburst of weeping so bitter that we who \
listened to him must have been very stones had we not joined him in it, \
comparing what we saw of him the first time with what we saw now; for, as I \
said, he was a graceful and gracious youth, and in his courteous and polished \
language showed himself to be of good birth and courtly breeding, and rustics \
as we were that listened to him, even to our rusticity his gentle bearing \
sufficed to make it plain. \"But in the midst of his conversation he stopped \
and became silent, keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, \
during which we stood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this \
abstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now staring at \
the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving an eyelid, again \
closing them, compressing his lips and raising his eyebrows, we could \
perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him; and \
before long he showed that what we imagined was the truth, for he arose in a \
fury from the ground where he had thrown himself, and attacked the first he \
found near him with such rage and fierceness that if we had not dragged him \
off him, he would have beaten or bitten him to death, all the while \
exclaiming, 'Oh faithless Fernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of \
the wrong thou hast done me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, \
abode and dwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and to \
these he added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando and \
charging him with treachery and faithlessness. \"We forced him to release his \
hold with no little difficulty, and without another word he left us, and \
rushing off plunged in among these brakes and brambles, so as to make it \
impossible for us to follow him; from this we suppose that madness comes upon \
him from time to time, and that some one called Fernando must have done him a \
wrong of a grievous nature such as the condition to which it had brought him \
seemed to show. All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions, \
and they have been many, on which he has crossed our path, at one time to beg \
the shepherds to give him some of the food they carry, at another to take it \
from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness upon him, even though \
the shepherds offer it freely, he will not accept it but snatches it from \
them by dint of blows; but when he is in his senses he begs it for the love \
of God, courteously and civilly, and receives it with many thanks and not a \
few tears. And to tell you the truth, sirs,\" continued the goatherd, \"it \
was yesterday that we resolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our \
servants, and the other two friends of mine, to go in search of him until we \
find him, and when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, \
to the town of Almodovar, which is eight leagues from this, and there strive \
to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learn when he is in \
his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom we may give notice of \
his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say in answer to what you have asked \
me; and be sure that the owner of the articles you found is he whom you saw \
pass by with such nimbleness and so naked.\" For Don Quixote had already \
described how he had seen the man go bounding along the mountain side, and he \
was now filled with amazement at what he heard from the goatherd, and more \
eager than ever to discover who the unhappy madman was; and in his heart he \
resolved, as he had done before, to search for him all over the mountain, not \
leaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him. But chance \
arranged matters better than he expected or hoped, for at that very moment, \
in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood, the youth he wished \
to find made his appearance, coming along talking to himself in a way that \
would have been unintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance. His \
garb was what has been described, save that as he drew near, Don Quixote \
perceived that a tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned, from which \
he concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank. \
Approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but with \
great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equal politeness, \
and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred bearing and grace to \
embrace him, and held him for some time close in his arms as if he had known \
him for a long time. The other, whom we may call the Ragged One of the Sorry \
Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the Rueful, after submitting to the \
embrace pushed him back a little and, placing his hands on Don Quixote's \
shoulders, stood gazing at him as if seeking to see whether he knew him, not \
less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face, figure, and armour of Don \
Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight of him. To be brief, the first to \
speak after embracing was the Ragged One, and he said what will be told \
farther on. CHAPTER XXIV. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA \
MORENA The history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don \
Quixote listened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying: \
\"Of a surety, senor, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you for \
the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would I were in a \
condition to requite with something more than good-will that which you have \
displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me; but my fate \
does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses done me save the \
hearty desire to repay them.\" \"Mine,\" replied Don Quixote, \"is to be of \
service to you, so much so that I had resolved not to quit these mountains \
until I had found you, and learned of you whether there is any kind of relief \
to be found for that sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you \
seem to labour; and to search for you with all possible diligence, if search \
had been necessary. And if your misfortune should prove to be one of those \
that refuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was my purpose to join \
you in lamenting and mourning over it, so far as I could; for it is still \
some comfort in misfortune to find one who can feel for it. And if my good \
intentions deserve to be acknowledged with any kind of courtesy, I entreat \
you, senor, by that which I perceive you possess in so high a degree, and \
likewise conjure you by whatever you love or have loved best in life, to tell \
me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die in these \
solitudes like a brute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to \
your condition as your garb and appearance show. And I swear,\" added Don \
Quixote, \"by the order of knighthood which I have received, and by my \
vocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you with all \
the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving your misfortune if it \
admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it as I promised to do.\" \
The Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk in this \
strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again, and again \
survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly examined him, he \
said to him: \"If you have anything to give me to eat, for God's sake give it \
me, and after I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the \
goodwill you have displayed towards me.\" Sancho from his sack, and the \
goatherd from his pouch, furnished the Ragged One with the means of appeasing \
his hunger, and what they gave him he ate like a half-witted being, so \
hastily that he took no time between mouthfuls, gorging rather than \
swallowing; and while he ate neither he nor they who observed him uttered a \
word. As soon as he had done he made signs to them to follow him, which they \
did, and he led them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the \
corner of a rock. On reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and the \
others did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One, settling \
himself in his place, said: \"If it is your wish, sirs, that I should \
disclose in a few words the surpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must \
promise not to break the thread of my sad story with any question or other \
interruption, for the instant you do so the tale I tell will come to an \
end.\" These words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his \
squire had told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had \
crossed the river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to the \
Ragged One, he went on to say: \"I give you this warning because I wish to \
pass briefly over the story of my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory \
only serves to add fresh ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall \
I make an end of the recital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of \
importance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity.\" Don Quixote gave the \
promise for himself and the others, and with this assurance he began as \
follows: \"My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this \
Andalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great that my \
parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being able by \
their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do little to relieve \
reverses sent by Heaven. In that same country there was a heaven in which \
love had placed all the glory I could desire; such was the beauty of \
Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich as I, but of happier fortunes, and of \
less firmness than was due to so worthy a passion as mine. This Luscinda I \
loved, worshipped, and adored from my earliest and tenderest years, and she \
loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood. Our parents were \
aware of our feelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for they saw \
clearly that as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us, \
a thing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families and \
wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grew the love between us, so that the \
father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety's sake to refuse me admission to \
his house, in this perhaps imitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated \
by the poets, and this refusal but added love to love and flame to flame; for \
though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it upon \
our pens, which can make known the heart's secrets to a loved one more freely \
than tongues; for many a time the presence of the object of love shakes the \
firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah heavens! how many \
letters did I write her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive! \
how many ditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and \
made known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled in its \
recollections and dallied with its desires! At length growing impatient and \
feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved to put into \
execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of winning my desired \
and merited reward, to ask her of her father for my lawful wife, which I did. \
To this his answer was that he thanked me for the disposition I showed to do \
honour to him and to regard myself as honoured by the bestowal of his \
treasure; but that as my father was alive it was his by right to make this \
demand, for if it were not in accordance with his full will and pleasure, \
Luscinda was not to be taken or given by stealth. I thanked him for his \
kindness, reflecting that there was reason in what he said, and that my \
father would assent to it as soon as I should tell him, and with that view I \
went the very same instant to let him know what my desires were. When I \
entered the room where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand, \
which, before I could utter a word, he gave me, saying, 'By this letter thou \
wilt see, Cardenio, the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve thee.' This \
Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs, probably know already, is a grandee of Spain who \
has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia. I took and read the letter, \
which was couched in terms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be \
wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke made in it, which \
was that he would send me immediately to him, as he wished me to become the \
companion, not servant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the \
charge of placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he \
held me. On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I \
heard my father say, 'Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in \
accordance with the duke's wish, and give thanks to God who is opening a road \
to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost deserve; and to \
these words he added others of fatherly counsel. The time for my departure \
arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told her all that had occurred, as \
I did also to her father, entreating him to allow some delay, and to defer \
the disposal of her hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of \
me: he gave me the promise, and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings \
unnumbered. Finally, I presented myself to the duke, and was received and \
treated by him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old \
servants growing envious of me, and regarding the duke's inclination to show \
me favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave the \
greatest pleasure was the duke's second son, Fernando by name, a gallant \
youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very soon made so \
intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody; for though the \
elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did not carry his \
affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando. It so happened, \
then, that as between friends no secret remains unshared, and as the favour I \
enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship, he made all his thoughts \
known to me, and in particular a love affair which troubled his mind a \
little. He was deeply in love with a peasant girl, a vassal of his father's, \
the daughter of wealthy parents, and herself so beautiful, modest, discreet, \
and virtuous, that no one who knew her was able to decide in which of these \
respects she was most highly gifted or most excelled. The attractions of the \
fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernando to such a point that, in \
order to gain his object and overcome her virtuous resolutions, he determined \
to pledge his word to her to become her husband, for to attempt it in any \
other way was to attempt an impossibility. Bound to him as I was by \
friendship, I strove by the best arguments and the most forcible examples I \
could think of to restrain and dissuade him from such a course; but \
perceiving I produced no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his \
father, acquainted with the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and \
shrewd, foresaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a good \
servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to the \
honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, he told me he \
could find no better way of effacing from his mind the beauty that so \
enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months, and that he wished \
the absence to be effected by our going, both of us, to my father's house \
under the pretence, which he would make to the duke, of going to see and buy \
some fine horses that there were in my city, which produces the best in the \
world. When I heard him say so, even if his resolution had not been so good a \
one I should have hailed it as one of the happiest that could be imagined, \
prompted by my affection, seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it \
offered me of returning to see my Luscinda. With this thought and wish I \
commended his idea and encouraged his design, advising him to put it into \
execution as quickly as possible, as, in truth, absence produced its effect \
in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings. But, as afterwards appeared, \
when he said this to me he had already enjoyed the peasant girl under the \
title of husband, and was waiting for an opportunity of making it known with \
safety to himself, being in dread of what his father the duke would do when \
he came to know of his folly. It happened, then, that as with young men love \
is for the most part nothing more than appetite, which, as its final object \
is enjoyment, comes to an end on obtaining it, and that which seemed to be \
love takes to flight, as it cannot pass the limit fixed by nature, which \
fixes no limit to true love--what I mean is that after Don Fernando had \
enjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and his eagerness cooled, and \
if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself in order to cure his love, he \
was now in reality anxious to go to avoid keeping his promise. \"The duke \
gave him permission, and ordered me to accompany him; we arrived at my city, \
and my father gave him the reception due to his rank; I saw Luscinda without \
delay, and, though it had not been dead or deadened, my love gathered fresh \
life. To my sorrow I told the story of it to Don Fernando, for I thought that \
in virtue of the great friendship he bore me I was bound to conceal nothing \
from him. I extolled her beauty, her gaiety, her wit, so warmly, that my \
praises excited in him a desire to see a damsel adorned by such attractions. \
To my misfortune I yielded to it, showing her to him one night by the light \
of a taper at a window where we used to talk to one another. As she appeared \
to him in her dressing-gown, she drove all the beauties he had seen until \
then out of his recollection; speech failed him, his head turned, he was \
spell-bound, and in the end love-smitten, as you will see in the course of \
the story of my misfortune; and to inflame still further his passion, which \
he hid from me and revealed to Heaven alone, it so happened that one day he \
found a note of hers entreating me to demand her of her father in marriage, \
so delicate, so modest, and so tender, that on reading it he told me that in \
Luscinda alone were combined all the charms of beauty and understanding that \
were distributed among all the other women in the world. It is true, and I \
own it now, that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had to praise \
Luscinda, it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from his mouth, and I \
began to fear, and with reason to feel distrust of him, for there was no \
moment when he was not ready to talk of Luscinda, and he would start the \
subject himself even though he dragged it in unseasonably, a circumstance \
that aroused in me a certain amount of jealousy; not that I feared any change \
in the constancy or faith of Luscinda; but still my fate led me to forebode \
what she assured me against. Don Fernando contrived always to read the \
letters I sent to Luscinda and her answers to me, under the pretence that he \
enjoyed the wit and sense of both. It so happened, then, that Luscinda having \
begged of me a book of chivalry to read, one that she was very fond of, \
Amadis of Gaul-\" Don Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, \
than he said: \"Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that \
the Lady Luscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would \
have been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding, \
for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for \
such delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned, you need \
waste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, and intelligence; for, \
on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare her to be the most beautiful \
and the most intelligent woman in the world; and I wish your worship had, \
along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her the worthy Don Rugel of Greece, for I \
know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish Daraida and Garaya, and the \
shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel, and the admirable verses of his \
bucolics, sung and delivered by him with such sprightliness, wit, and ease; \
but a time may come when this omission can be remedied, and to rectify it \
nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so good as to come with me \
to my village, for there I can give you more than three hundred books which \
are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life;--though it \
occurs to me that I have not got one of them now, thanks to the spite of \
wicked and envious enchanters;--but pardon me for having broken the promise \
we made not to interrupt your discourse; for when I hear chivalry or \
knights-errant mentioned, I can no more help talking about them than the rays \
of the sun can help giving heat, or those of the moon moisture; pardon me, \
therefore, and proceed, for that is more to the purpose now.\" While Don \
Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his head to fall upon his breast, \
and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice Don Quixote bade him go \
on with his story, he neither looked up nor uttered a word in reply; but \
after some time he raised his head and said, \"I cannot get rid of the idea, \
nor will anyone in the world remove it, or make me think otherwise--and he \
would be a blockhead who would hold or believe anything else than that that \
arrant knave Master Elisabad made free with Queen Madasima.\" \"That is not \
true, by all that's good,\" said Don Quixote in high wrath, turning upon him \
angrily, as his way was; \"and it is a very great slander, or rather \
villainy. Queen Madasima was a very illustrious lady, and it is not to be \
supposed that so exalted a princess would have made free with a quack; and \
whoever maintains the contrary lies like a great scoundrel, and I will give \
him to know it, on foot or on horseback, armed or unarmed, by night or by \
day, or as he likes best.\" Cardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad \
fit having now come upon him, he had no disposition to go on with his story, \
nor would Don Quixote have listened to it, so much had what he had heard \
about Madasima disgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up for her as if she \
were in earnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholy books \
brought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when he heard himself \
given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting names, not \
relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found near him, and with it \
delivered such a blow on Don Quixote's breast that he laid him on his back. \
Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in this fashion, attacked the madman \
with his closed fist; but the Ragged One received him in such a way that with \
a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet, and then mounting upon him \
crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the goatherd, who came to the \
rescue, shared the same fate; and having beaten and pummelled them all he \
left them and quietly withdrew to his hiding-place on the mountain. Sancho \
rose, and with the rage he felt at finding himself so belaboured without \
deserving it, ran to take vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him of not \
giving them warning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if \
they had known it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves. \
The goatherd replied that he had said so, and that if he had not heard him, \
that was no fault of his. Sancho retorted, and the goatherd rejoined, and the \
altercation ended in their seizing each other by the beard, and exchanging \
such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made peace between them, they \
would have knocked one another to pieces. \"Leave me alone, Sir Knight of the \
Rueful Countenance,\" said Sancho, grappling with the goatherd, \"for of this \
fellow, who is a clown like myself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take \
satisfaction for the affront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to \
hand like an honest man.\" \"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I know \
that he is not to blame for what has happened.\" With this he pacified them, \
and again asked the goatherd if it would be possible to find Cardenio, as he \
felt the greatest anxiety to know the end of his story. The goatherd told \
him, as he had told him before, that there was no knowing of a certainty \
where his lair was; but that if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood \
he could not fail to fall in with him either in or out of his senses. CHAPTER \
XXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OF \
LA MANCHA IN THE SIERRA MORENA, AND OF HIS IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OF \
BELTENEBROS Don Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting \
Rocinante bade Sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very \
discontentedly. They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most rugged \
part of the mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his \
master, and longing for him to begin, so that there should be no breach of \
the injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence so long he said to \
him: \"Senor Don Quixote, give me your worship's blessing and dismissal, for \
I'd like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can at any \
rate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to go through these \
solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have a mind is burying me \
alive. If luck would have it that animals spoke as they did in the days of \
Guisopete, it would not be so bad, because I could talk to Rocinante about \
whatever came into my head, and so put up with my ill-fortune; but it is a \
hard case, and not to be borne with patience, to go seeking adventures all \
one's life and get nothing but kicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, \
and with all this to have to sew up one's mouth without daring to say what is \
in one's heart, just as if one were dumb.\" \"I understand thee, Sancho,\" \
replied Don Quixote; \"thou art dying to have the interdict I placed upon thy \
tongue removed; consider it removed, and say what thou wilt while we are \
wandering in these mountains.\" \"So be it,\" said Sancho; \"let me speak \
now, for God knows what will happen by-and-by; and to take advantage of the \
permit at once, I ask, what made your worship stand up so for that Queen \
Majimasa, or whatever her name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot \
was a friend of hers or not? for if your worship had let that pass--and you \
were not a judge in the matter--it is my belief the madman would have gone on \
with his story, and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more than half \
a dozen cuffs would have been escaped.\" \"In faith, Sancho,\" answered Don \
Quixote, \"if thou knewest as I do what an honourable and illustrious lady \
Queen Madasima was, I know thou wouldst say I had great patience that I did \
not break in pieces the mouth that uttered such blasphemies, for a very great \
blasphemy it is to say or imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon. \
The truth of the story is that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned \
was a man of great prudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and \
physician to the queen, but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense \
deserving very severe punishment; and as a proof that Cardenio did not know \
what he was saying, remember when he said it he was out of his wits.\" \"That \
is what I say,\" said Sancho; \"there was no occasion for minding the words \
of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your worship, and he had sent \
that stone at your head instead of at your breast, a fine way we should have \
been in for standing up for my lady yonder, God confound her! And then, would \
not Cardenio have gone free as a madman?\" \"Against men in their senses or \
against madmen,\" said Don Quixote, \"every knight-errant is bound to stand \
up for the honour of women, whoever they may be, much more for queens of such \
high degree and dignity as Queen Madasima, for whom I have a particular \
regard on account of her amiable qualities; for, besides being extremely \
beautiful, she was very wise, and very patient under her misfortunes, of \
which she had many; and the counsel and society of the Master Elisabad were a \
great help and support to her in enduring her afflictions with wisdom and \
resignation; hence the ignorant and ill-disposed vulgar took occasion to say \
and think that she was his mistress; and they lie, I say it once more, and \
will lie two hundred times more, all who think and say so.\" \"I neither say \
nor think so,\" said Sancho; \"let them look to it; with their bread let them \
eat it; they have rendered account to God whether they misbehaved or not; I \
come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I am not fond of prying into other \
men's lives; he who buys and lies feels it in his purse; moreover, naked was \
I born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain; but if they did, what \
is that to me? many think there are flitches where there are no hooks; but \
who can put gates to the open plain? moreover they said of God-\" \"God bless \
me,\" said Don Quixote, \"what a set of absurdities thou art stringing \
together! What has what we are talking about got to do with the proverbs thou \
art threading one after the other? for God's sake hold thy tongue, Sancho, \
and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass and don't meddle in what does not \
concern thee; and understand with all thy five senses that everything I have \
done, am doing, or shall do, is well founded on reason and in conformity with \
the rules of chivalry, for I understand them better than all the world that \
profess them.\" \"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"is it a good rule of chivalry \
that we should go astray through these mountains without path or road, \
looking for a madman who when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish \
what he began, not his story, but your worship's head and my ribs, and end by \
breaking them altogether for us?\" \"Peace, I say again, Sancho,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"for let me tell thee it is not so much the desire of finding that \
madman that leads me into these regions as that which I have of performing \
among them an achievement wherewith I shall win eternal name and fame \
throughout the known world; and it shall be such that I shall thereby set the \
seal on all that can make a knight-errant perfect and famous.\" \"And is it \
very perilous, this achievement?\" \"No,\" replied he of the Rueful \
Countenance; \"though it may be in the dice that we may throw deuce-ace \
instead of sixes; but all will depend on thy diligence.\" \"On my \
diligence!\" said Sancho. \"Yes,\" said Don Quixote, \"for if thou dost \
return soon from the place where I mean to send thee, my penance will be soon \
over, and my glory will soon begin. But as it is not right to keep thee any \
longer in suspense, waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have thee \
know, Sancho, that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect \
knights-errant--I am wrong to say he was one; he stood alone, the first, the \
only one, the lord of all that were in the world in his time. A fig for Don \
Belianis, and for all who say he equalled him in any respect, for, my oath \
upon it, they are deceiving themselves! I say, too, that when a painter \
desires to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy the originals of \
the rarest painters that he knows; and the same rule holds good for all the \
most important crafts and callings that serve to adorn a state; thus must he \
who would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses, in whose person \
and labours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience; \
as Virgil, too, shows us in the person of AEneas the virtue of a pious son \
and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain; not representing or \
describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, so as to leave the \
example of their virtues to posterity. In the same way Amadis was the \
polestar, day-star, sun of valiant and devoted knights, whom all we who fight \
under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to imitate. This, then, being \
so, I consider, friend Sancho, that the knight-errant who shall imitate him \
most closely will come nearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry. Now \
one of the instances in which this knight most conspicuously showed his \
prudence, worth, valour, endurance, fortitude, and love, was when he \
withdrew, rejected by the Lady Oriana, to do penance upon the Pena Pobre, \
changing his name into that of Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and \
appropriate to the life which he had voluntarily adopted. So, as it is easier \
for me to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting off \
serpents' heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets, and \
breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well suited for a similar \
purpose, I must not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently \
offers me its forelock.\" \"What is it in reality,\" said Sancho, \"that your \
worship means to do in such an out-of-the-way place as this?\" \"Have I not \
told thee,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that I mean to imitate Amadis here, \
playing the victim of despair, the madman, the maniac, so as at the same time \
to imitate the valiant Don Roland, when at the fountain he had evidence of \
the fair Angelica having disgraced herself with Medoro and through grief \
thereat went mad, and plucked up trees, troubled the waters of the clear \
springs, slew destroyed flocks, burned down huts, levelled houses, dragged \
mares after him, and perpetrated a hundred thousand other outrages worthy of \
everlasting renown and record? And though I have no intention of imitating \
Roland, or Orlando, or Rotolando (for he went by all these names), step by \
step in all the mad things he did, said, and thought, I will make a rough \
copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential; but \
perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis, who \
without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow, \
gained as much fame as the most famous.\" \"It seems to me,\" said Sancho, \
\"that the knights who behaved in this way had provocation and cause for \
those follies and penances; but what cause has your worship for going mad? \
What lady has rejected you, or what evidence have you found to prove that the \
lady Dulcinea del Toboso has been trifling with Moor or Christian?\" \"There \
is the point,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and that is the beauty of this \
business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he has \
cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and let my lady \
know, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in the moist; moreover I have \
abundant cause in the long separation I have endured from my lady till death, \
Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didst hear that shepherd Ambrosio say the \
other day, in absence all ills are felt and feared; and so, friend Sancho, \
waste no time in advising me against so rare, so happy, and so unheard-of an \
imitation; mad I am, and mad I must be until thou returnest with the answer \
to a letter that I mean to send by thee to my lady Dulcinea; and if it be \
such as my constancy deserves, my insanity and penance will come to an end; \
and if it be to the opposite effect, I shall become mad in earnest, and, \
being so, I shall suffer no more; thus in whatever way she may answer I shall \
escape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me, enjoying \
in my senses the boon thou bearest me, or as a madman not feeling the evil \
thou bringest me. But tell me, Sancho, hast thou got Mambrino's helmet safe? \
for I saw thee take it up from the ground when that ungrateful wretch tried \
to break it in pieces but could not, by which the fineness of its temper may \
be seen.\" To which Sancho made answer, \"By the living God, Sir Knight of \
the Rueful Countenance, I cannot endure or bear with patience some of the \
things that your worship says; and from them I begin to suspect that all you \
tell me about chivalry, and winning kingdoms and empires, and giving islands, \
and bestowing other rewards and dignities after the custom of knights-errant, \
must be all made up of wind and lies, and all pigments or figments, or \
whatever we may call them; for what would anyone think that heard your \
worship calling a barber's basin Mambrino's helmet without ever seeing the \
mistake all this time, but that one who says and maintains such things must \
have his brains addled? I have the basin in my sack all dinted, and I am \
taking it home to have it mended, to trim my beard in it, if, by God's grace, \
I am allowed to see my wife and children some day or other.\" \"Look here, \
Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"by him thou didst swear by just now I swear \
thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in the world has or \
ever had. Is it possible that all this time thou hast been going about with \
me thou hast never found out that all things belonging to knights-errant seem \
to be illusions and nonsense and ravings, and to go always by contraries? And \
not because it really is so, but because there is always a swarm of \
enchanters in attendance upon us that change and alter everything with us, \
and turn things as they please, isolated peak among the others that \
surrounded it. Past its base there flowed a gentle brook, all around it \
spread a meadow so green and luxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to \
look upon it, and forest trees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to \
the charms of the spot. Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance \
fixed his choice for the performance of his penance, and as he beheld it \
exclaimed in a loud voice as though he were out of his senses: \"This is the \
place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose for bewailing the misfortune \
in which ye yourselves have plunged me: this is the spot where the \
overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters of yon little brook, and my \
deep and endless sighs shall stir unceasingly the leaves of these mountain \
trees, in testimony and token of the pain my persecuted heart is suffering. \
Oh, ye rural deities, whoever ye be that haunt this lone spot, give ear to \
the complaint of a wretched lover whom long absence and brooding jealousy \
have driven to bewail his fate among these wilds and complain of the hard \
heart of that fair and ungrateful one, the end and limit of all human beauty! \
Oh, ye wood nymphs and dryads, that dwell in the thickets of the forest, so \
may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooed never disturb your \
sweet repose, help me to lament my hard fate or at least weary not at \
listening to it! Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso, day of my night, glory of my pain, \
guide of my path, star of my fortune, so may Heaven grant thee in full all \
thou seekest of it, bethink thee of the place and condition to which absence \
from thee has brought me, and make that return in kindness that is due to my \
fidelity! Oh, lonely trees, that from this day forward shall bear me company \
in my solitude, give me some sign by the gentle movement of your boughs that \
my presence is not distasteful to you! Oh, thou, my squire, pleasant \
companion in my prosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy memory what \
thou shalt see me do here, so that thou mayest relate and report it to the \
sole cause of all,\" and so saying he dismounted from Rocinante, and in an \
instant relieved him of saddle and bridle, and giving him a slap on the \
croup, said, \"He gives thee freedom who is bereft of it himself, oh steed as \
excellent in deed as thou art unfortunate in thy lot; begone where thou wilt, \
for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neither Astolfo's hippogriff, \
nor the famed Frontino that cost Bradamante so dear, could equal thee in \
speed.\" Seeing this Sancho said, \"Good luck to him who has saved us the \
trouble of stripping the pack-saddle off Dapple! By my faith he would not \
have gone without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise; \
though if he were here I would not let anyone strip him, for there would be \
no occasion, as he had nothing of the lover or victim of despair about him, \
inasmuch as his master, which I was while it was God's pleasure, was nothing \
of the sort; and indeed, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, if my \
departure and your worship's madness are to come off in earnest, it will be \
as well to saddle Rocinante again in order that he may supply the want of \
Dapple, because it will save me time in going and returning: for if I go on \
foot I don't know when I shall get there or when I shall get back, as I am, \
in truth, a bad walker.\" \"I declare, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"it \
shall be as thou wilt, for thy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and three \
days hence thou wilt depart, for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what \
I do and say for her sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it.\" \"But what \
more have I to see besides what I have seen?\" said Sancho. \"Much thou \
knowest about it!\" said Don Quixote. \"I have now got to tear up my \
garments, to scatter about my armour, knock my head against these rocks, and \
more of the same sort of thing, which thou must witness.\" \"For the love of \
God,\" said Sancho, \"be careful, your worship, how you give yourself those \
knocks on the head, for you may come across such a rock, and in such a way, \
that the very first may put an end to the whole contrivance of this penance; \
and I should think, if indeed knocks on the head seem necessary to you, and \
this business cannot be done without them, you might be content--as the whole \
thing is feigned, and counterfeit, and in joke--you might be content, I say, \
with giving them to yourself in the water, or against something soft, like \
cotton; and leave it all to me; for I'll tell my lady that your worship \
knocked your head against a point of rock harder than a diamond.\" \"I thank \
thee for thy good intentions, friend Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"but I \
would have thee know that all these things I am doing are not in joke, but \
very much in earnest, for anything else would be a transgression of the \
ordinances of chivalry, which forbid us to tell any lie whatever under the \
penalties due to apostasy; and to do one thing instead of another is just the \
same as lying; so my knocks on the head must be real, solid, and valid, \
without anything sophisticated or fanciful about them, and it will be needful \
to leave me some lint to dress my wounds, since fortune has compelled us to \
do without the balsam we lost.\" \"It was worse losing the ass,\" replied \
Sancho, \"for with him lint and all were lost; but I beg of your worship not \
to remind me again of that accursed liquor, for my soul, not to say my \
stomach, turns at hearing the very name of it; and I beg of you, too, to \
reckon as past the three days you allowed me for seeing the mad things you \
do, for I take them as seen already and pronounced upon, and I will tell \
wonderful stories to my lady; so write the letter and send me off at once, \
for I long to return and take your worship out of this purgatory where I am \
leaving you.\" \"Purgatory dost thou call it, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote, \
\"rather call it hell, or even worse if there be anything worse.\" \"For one \
who is in hell,\" said Sancho, \"nulla est retentio, as I have heard say.\" \
\"I do not understand what retentio means,\" said Don Quixote. \"Retentio,\" \
answered Sancho, \"means that whoever is in hell never comes nor can come out \
of it, which will be the opposite case with your worship or my legs will be \
idle, that is if I have spurs to enliven Rocinante: let me once get to El \
Toboso and into the presence of my lady Dulcinea, and I will tell her such \
things of the follies and madnesses (for it is all one) that your worship has \
done and is still doing, that I will manage to make her softer than a glove \
though I find her harder than a cork tree; and with her sweet and honeyed \
answer I will come back through the air like a witch, and take your worship \
out of this purgatory that seems to be hell but is not, as there is hope of \
getting out of it; which, as I have said, those in hell have not, and I \
believe your worship will not say anything to the contrary.\" \"That is true,\
\" said he of the Rueful Countenance, \"but how shall we manage to write the \
letter?\" \"And the ass-colt order too,\" added Sancho. \"All shall be \
included,\" said Don Quixote; \"and as there is no paper, it would be well \
done to write it on the leaves of trees, as the ancients did, or on tablets \
of wax; though that would be as hard to find just now as paper. But it has \
just occurred to me how it may be conveniently and even more than \
conveniently written, and that is in the note-book that belonged to Cardenio, \
and thou wilt take care to have it copied on paper, in a good hand, at the \
first village thou comest to where there is a schoolmaster, or if not, any \
sacristan will copy it; but see thou give it not to any notary to copy, for \
they write a law hand that Satan could not make out.\" \"But what is to be \
done about the signature?\" said Sancho. \"The letters of Amadis were never \
signed,\" said Don Quixote. \"That is all very well,\" said Sancho, \"but the \
order must needs be signed, and if it is copied they will say the signature \
is false, and I shall be left without ass-colts.\" \"The order shall go \
signed in the same book,\" said Don Quixote, \"and on seeing it my niece will \
make no difficulty about obeying it; as to the loveletter thou canst put by \
way of signature, 'Yours till death, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.' \
And it will be no great matter if it is in some other person's hand, for as \
well as I recollect Dulcinea can neither read nor write, nor in the whole \
course of her life has she seen handwriting or letter of mine, for my love \
and hers have been always platonic, not going beyond a modest look, and even \
that so seldom that I can safely swear I have not seen her four times in all \
these twelve years I have been loving her more than the light of these eyes \
that the earth will one day devour; and perhaps even of those four times she \
has not once perceived that I was looking at her: such is the retirement and \
seclusion in which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her mother Aldonza \
Nogales have brought her up.\" \"So, so!\" said Sancho; \"Lorenzo Corchuelo's \
daughter is the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo?\" \
\"She it is,\" said Don Quixote, \"and she it is that is worthy to be lady of \
the whole universe.\" \"I know her well,\" said Sancho, \"and let me tell you \
she can fling a crowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town. Giver of \
all good! but she is a brave lass, and a right and stout one, and fit to be \
helpmate to any knight-errant that is or is to be, who may make her his lady: \
the whoreson wench, what sting she has and what a voice! I can tell you one \
day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to call some \
labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field of her father's, and though \
they were better than half a league off they heard her as well as if they \
were at the foot of the tower; and the best of her is that she is not a bit \
prudish, for she has plenty of affability, and jokes with everybody, and has \
a grin and a jest for everything. So, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, I \
say you not only may and ought to do mad freaks for her sake, but you have a \
good right to give way to despair and hang yourself; and no one who knows of \
it but will say you did well, though the devil should take you; and I wish I \
were on my road already, simply to see her, for it is many a day since I saw \
her, and she must be altered by this time, for going about the fields always, \
and the sun and the air spoil women's looks greatly. But I must own the truth \
to your worship, Senor Don Quixote; until now I have been under a great \
mistake, for I believed truly and honestly that the lady Dulcinea must be \
some princess your worship was in love with, or some person great enough to \
deserve the rich presents you have sent her, such as the Biscayan and the \
galley slaves, and many more no doubt, for your worship must have won many \
victories in the time when I was not yet your squire. But all things \
considered, what good can it do the lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I mean the lady \
Dulcinea del Toboso, to have the vanquished your worship sends or will send \
coming to her and going down on their knees before her? Because may be when \
they came she'd be hackling flax or threshing on the threshing floor, and \
they'd be ashamed to see her, and she'd laugh, or resent the present.\" \"I \
have before now told thee many times, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that thou \
art a mighty great chatterer, and that with a blunt wit thou art always \
striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art and how rational \
I am, I would have thee listen to a short story. Thou must know that a \
certain widow, fair, young, independent, and rich, and above all free and \
easy, fell in love with a sturdy strapping young lay-brother; his superior \
came to know of it, and one day said to the worthy widow by way of brotherly \
remonstrance, 'I am surprised, senora, and not without good reason, that a \
woman of such high standing, so fair, and so rich as you are, should have \
fallen in love with such a mean, low, stupid fellow as So-and-so, when in \
this house there are so many masters, graduates, and divinity students from \
among whom you might choose as if they were a lot of pears, saying this one \
I'll take, that I won't take;' but she replied to him with great \
sprightliness and candour, 'My dear sir, you are very much mistaken, and your \
ideas are very old-fashioned, if you think that I have made a bad choice in \
So-and-so, fool as he seems; because for all I want with him he knows as much \
and more philosophy than Aristotle.' In the same way, Sancho, for all I want \
with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the most exalted princess on \
earth. It is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises of \
ladies under the fancy names they give them, had any such mistresses. \
Thinkest thou that the Amarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the Dianas, \
the Galateas, the Filidas, and all the rest of them, that the books, the \
ballads, the barber's shops, the theatres are full of, were really and truly \
ladies of flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify and have \
glorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent them for the most part \
to furnish a subject for their verses, and that they may pass for lovers, or \
for men valiant enough to be so; and so it suffices me to think and believe \
that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous; and as to her pedigree it \
is very little matter, for no one will examine into it for the purpose of \
conferring any order upon her, and I, for my part, reckon her the most \
exalted princess in the world. For thou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost \
not know, that two things alone beyond all others are incentives to love, and \
these are great beauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found \
in Dulcinea in the highest degree, for in beauty no one equals her and in \
good name few approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, I \
persuade myself that all I say is as I say, neither more nor less, and I \
picture her in my imagination as I would have her to be, as well in beauty as \
in condition; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia come up to her, nor \
any other of the famous women of times past, Greek, Barbarian, or Latin; and \
let each say what he will, for if in this I am taken to task by the ignorant, \
I shall not be censured by the critical.\" \"I say that your worship is \
entirely right,\" said Sancho, \"and that I am an ass. But I know not how the \
name of ass came into my mouth, for a rope is not to be mentioned in the \
house of him who has been hanged; but now for the letter, and then, God be \
with you, I am off.\" Don Quixote took out the note-book, and, retiring to \
one side, very deliberately began to write the letter, and when he had \
finished it he called to Sancho, saying he wished to read it to him, so that \
he might commit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evil \
fortune like his anything might be apprehended. To which Sancho replied, \
\"Write it two or three times there in the book and give it to me, and I will \
carry it very carefully, because to expect me to keep it in my memory is all \
nonsense, for I have such a bad one that I often forget my own name; but for \
all that repeat it to me, as I shall like to hear it, for surely it will run \
as if it was in print.\" \"Listen,\" said Don Quixote, \"this is what it \
says: \"DON QUIXOTE'S LETTER TO DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO \"Sovereign and exalted \
Lady,--The pierced by the point of absence, the wounded to the heart's core, \
sends thee, sweetest Dulcinea del Toboso, the health that he himself enjoys \
not. If thy beauty despises me, if thy worth is not for me, if thy scorn is \
my affliction, though I be sufficiently long-suffering, hardly shall I endure \
this anxiety, which, besides being oppressive, is protracted. My good squire \
Sancho will relate to thee in full, fair ingrate, dear enemy, the condition \
to which I am reduced on thy account: if it be thy pleasure to give me \
relief, I am thine; if not, do as may be pleasing to thee; for by ending my \
life I shall satisfy thy cruelty and my desire. \"Thine till death, \"The \
Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\" \"By the life of my father,\" said \
Sancho, when he heard the letter, \"it is the loftiest thing I ever heard. \
Body of me! how your worship says everything as you like in it! And how well \
you fit in 'The Knight of the Rueful Countenance' into the signature. I \
declare your worship is indeed the very devil, and there is nothing you don't \
know.\" \"Everything is needed for the calling I follow,\" said Don Quixote. \
\"Now then,\" said Sancho, \"let your worship put the order for the three \
ass-colts on the other side, and sign it very plainly, that they may \
recognise it at first sight.\" \"With all my heart,\" said Don Quixote, and \
as he had written it he read it to this effect: \"Mistress Niece,--By this \
first of ass-colts please pay to Sancho Panza, my squire, three of the five I \
left at home in your charge: said three ass-colts to be paid and delivered \
for the same number received here in hand, which upon this and upon his \
receipt shall be duly paid. Done in the heart of the Sierra Morena, the \
twenty-seventh of August of this present year.\" \"That will do,\" said \
Sancho; \"now let your worship sign it.\" \"There is no need to sign it,\" \
said Don Quixote, \"but merely to put my flourish, which is the same as a \
signature, and enough for three asses, or even three hundred.\" \"I can trust \
your worship,\" returned Sancho; \"let me go and saddle Rocinante, and be \
ready to give me your blessing, for I mean to go at once without seeing the \
fooleries your worship is going to do; I'll say I saw you do so many that she \
will not want any more.\" \"At any rate, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"I \
should like--and there is reason for it--I should like thee, I say, to see me \
stripped to the skin and performing a dozen or two of insanities, which I can \
get done in less than half an hour; for having seen them with thine own eyes, \
thou canst then safely swear to the rest that thou wouldst add; and I promise \
thee thou wilt not tell of as many as I mean to perform.\" \"For the love of \
God, master mine,\" said Sancho, \"let me not see your worship stripped, for \
it will sorely grieve me, and I shall not be able to keep from tears, and my \
head aches so with all I shed last night for Dapple, that I am not fit to \
begin any fresh weeping; but if it is your worship's pleasure that I should \
see some insanities, do them in your clothes, short ones, and such as come \
readiest to hand; for I myself want nothing of the sort, and, as I have said, \
it will be a saving of time for my return, which will be with the news your \
worship desires and deserves. If not, let the lady Dulcinea look to it; if \
she does not answer reasonably, I swear as solemnly as I can that I will \
fetch a fair answer out of her stomach with kicks and cuffs; for why should \
it be borne that a knight-errant as famous as your worship should go mad \
without rhyme or reason for a--? Her ladyship had best not drive me to say \
it, for by God I will speak out and let off everything cheap, even if it \
doesn't sell: I am pretty good at that! she little knows me; faith, if she \
knew me she'd be in awe of me.\" \"In faith, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"to \
all appearance thou art no sounder in thy wits than I.\" \"I am not so mad,\" \
answered Sancho, \"but I am more peppery; but apart from all this, what has \
your worship to eat until I come back? Will you sally out on the road like \
Cardenio to force it from the shepherds?\" \"Let not that anxiety trouble \
thee,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for even if I had it I should not eat anything \
but the herbs and the fruits which this meadow and these trees may yield me; \
the beauty of this business of mine lies in not eating, and in performing \
other mortifications.\" \"Do you know what I am afraid of?\" said Sancho upon \
this; \"that I shall not be able to find my way back to this spot where I am \
leaving you, it is such an out-of-the-way place.\" \"Observe the landmarks \
well,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will try not to go far from this \
neighbourhood, and I will even take care to mount the highest of these rocks \
to see if I can discover thee returning; however, not to miss me and lose \
thyself, the best plan will be to cut some branches of the broom that is so \
abundant about here, and as thou goest to lay them at intervals until thou \
hast come out upon the plain; these will serve thee, after the fashion of the \
clue in the labyrinth of Theseus, as marks and signs for finding me on thy \
return.\" \"So I will,\" said Sancho Panza, and having cut some, he asked his \
master's blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his leave \
of him, and mounting Rocinante, of whom Don Quixote charged him earnestly to \
have as much care as of his own person, he set out for the plain, strewing at \
intervals the branches of broom as his master had recommended him; and so he \
went his way, though Don Quixote still entreated him to see him do were it \
only a couple of mad acts. He had not gone a hundred paces, however, when he \
returned and said: \"I must say, senor, your worship said quite right, that \
in order to be able to swear without a weight on my conscience that I had \
seen you do mad things, it would be well for me to see if it were only one; \
though in your worship's remaining here I have seen a very great one.\" \"Did \
I not tell thee so?\" said Don Quixote. \"Wait, Sancho, and I will do them in \
the saying of a credo,\" and pulling off his breeches in all haste he \
stripped himself to his skin and his shirt, and then, without more ado, he \
cut a couple of gambados in the air, and a couple of somersaults, heels over \
head, making such a display that, not to see it a second time, Sancho wheeled \
Rocinante round, and felt easy, and satisfied in his mind that he could swear \
he had left his master mad; and so we will leave him to follow his road until \
his return, which was a quick one. CHAPTER XXVI. IN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE \
REFINEMENTS WHEREWITH DON QUIXOTE PLAYED THE PART OF A LOVER IN THE SIERRA \
MORENA Returning to the proceedings of him of the Rueful Countenance when he \
found himself alone, the history says that when Don Quixote had completed the \
performance of the somersaults or capers, naked from the waist down and \
clothed from the waist up, and saw that Sancho had gone off without waiting \
to see any more crazy feats, he climbed up to the top of a high rock, and \
there set himself to consider what he had several times before considered \
without ever coming to any conclusion on the point, namely whether it would \
be better and more to his purpose to imitate the outrageous madness of \
Roland, or the melancholy madness of Amadis; and communing with himself he \
said: \"What wonder is it if Roland was so good a knight and so valiant as \
everyone says he was, when, after all, he was enchanted, and nobody could \
kill him save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of his foot, and he \
always wore shoes with seven iron soles? Though cunning devices did not avail \
him against Bernardo del Carpio, who knew all about them, and strangled him \
in his arms at Roncesvalles. But putting the question of his valour aside, \
let us come to his losing his wits, for certain it is that he did lose them \
in consequence of the proofs he discovered at the fountain, and the \
intelligence the shepherd gave him of Angelica having slept more than two \
siestas with Medoro, a little curly-headed Moor, and page to Agramante. If he \
was persuaded that this was true, and that his lady had wronged him, it is no \
wonder that he should have gone mad; but I, how am I to imitate him in his \
madness, unless I can imitate him in the cause of it? For my Dulcinea, I will \
venture to swear, never saw a Moor in her life, as he is, in his proper \
costume, and she is this day as the mother that bore her, and I should \
plainly be doing her a wrong if, fancying anything else, I were to go mad \
with the same kind of madness as Roland the Furious. On the other hand, I see \
that Amadis of Gaul, without losing his senses and without doing anything \
mad, acquired as a lover as much fame as the most famous; for, according to \
his history, on finding himself rejected by his lady Oriana, who had ordered \
him not to appear in her presence until it should be her pleasure, all he did \
was to retire to the Pena Pobre in company with a hermit, and there he took \
his fill of weeping until Heaven sent him relief in the midst of his great \
grief and need. And if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the \
trouble to strip stark naked, or do mischief to these trees which have done \
me no harm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which \
will give me to drink whenever I have a mind? Long live the memory of Amadis \
and let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of La Mancha, of \
whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that if he did not achieve \
great things, he died in attempting them; and if I am not repulsed or \
rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as I have said, to be absent \
from her. And so, now to business; come to my memory ye deeds of Amadis, and \
show me how I am to begin to imitate you. I know already that what he chiefly \
did was to pray and commend himself to God; but what am I to do for a rosary, \
for I have not got one?\" And then it occurred to him how he might make one, \
and that was by tearing a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung \
down, and making eleven knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this \
served him for a rosary all the time he was there, during which he repeated \
countless ave-marias. But what distressed him greatly was not having another \
hermit there to confess him and receive consolation from; and so he solaced \
himself with pacing up and down the little meadow, and writing and carving on \
the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a multitude of verses all in \
harmony with his sadness, and some in praise of Dulcinea; but, when he was \
found there afterwards, the only ones completely legible that could be \
discovered were those that follow here: Ye on the mountain side that grow, Ye \
green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes, Are ye aweary of the woe That \
this poor aching bosom crushes? If it disturb you, and I owe Some reparation, \
it may be a Defence for me to let you know Don Quixote's tears are on the \
flow, And all for distant Dulcinea Del Toboso. The lealest lover time can \
show, Doomed for a lady-love to languish, Among these solitudes doth go, A \
prey to every kind of anguish. Why Love should like a spiteful foe Thus use \
him, he hath no idea, But hogsheads full--this doth he know-- Don Quixote's \
tears are on the flow, And all for distant Dulcinea Del Toboso. \
Adventure-seeking doth he go Up rugged heights, down rocky valleys, But hill \
or dale, or high or low, Mishap attendeth all his sallies: Love still pursues \
him to and fro, And plies his cruel scourge--ah me! a Relentless fate, an \
endless woe; Don Quixote's tears are on the flow, And all for distant \
Dulcinea Del Toboso. The addition of \"Del Toboso\" to Dulcinea's name gave \
rise to no little laughter among those who found the above lines, for they \
suspected Don Quixote must have fancied that unless he added \"del Toboso\" \
when he introduced the name of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible; \
which was indeed the fact, as he himself afterwards admitted. He wrote many \
more, but, as has been said, these three verses were all that could be \
plainly and perfectly deciphered. In this way, and in sighing and calling on \
the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams, and Echo, \
moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear him, as well as in looking \
for herbs to sustain him, he passed his time until Sancho's return; and had \
that been delayed three weeks, as it was three days, the Knight of the Rueful \
Countenance would have worn such an altered countenance that the mother that \
bore him would not have known him: and here it will be well to leave him, \
wrapped up in sighs and verses, to relate how Sancho Panza fared on his \
mission. As for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for El Toboso, \
and the next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had befallen \
him. As soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once more living \
through the air, and he could not bring himself to enter it though it was an \
hour when he might well have done so, for it was dinner-time, and he longed \
to taste something hot as it had been all cold fare with him for many days \
past. This craving drove him to draw near to the inn, still undecided whether \
to go in or not, and as he was hesitating there came out two persons who at \
once recognised him, and said one to the other: \"Senor licentiate, is not he \
on the horse there Sancho Panza who, our adventurer's housekeeper told us, \
went off with her master as esquire?\" \"So it is,\" said the licentiate, \
\"and that is our friend Don Quixote's horse;\" and if they knew him so well \
it was because they were the curate and the barber of his own village, the \
same who had carried out the scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as \
soon as they recognised Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of \
Don Quixote, they approached, and calling him by his name the curate said, \
\"Friend Sancho Panza, where is your master?\" Sancho recognised them at \
once, and determined to keep secret the place and circumstances where and \
under which he had left his master, so he replied that his master was engaged \
in a certain quarter on a certain matter of great importance to him which he \
could not disclose for the eyes in his head. \"Nay, nay,\" said the barber, \
\"if you don't tell us where he is, Sancho Panza, we will suspect as we \
suspect already, that you have murdered and robbed him, for here you are \
mounted on his horse; in fact, you must produce the master of the hack, or \
else take the consequences.\" \"There is no need of threats with me,\" said \
Sancho, \"for I am not a man to rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or \
God who made him, kill each one; my master is engaged very much to his taste \
doing penance in the midst of these mountains;\" and then, offhand and \
without stopping, he told them how he had left him, what adventures had \
befallen him, and how he was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del \
Toboso, the daughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and \
ears in love. They were both amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for \
though they were aware of Don Quixote's madness and the nature of it, each \
time they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder. They then asked \
Sancho Panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady Dulcinea del \
Toboso. He said it was written in a note-book, and that his master's \
directions were that he should have it copied on paper at the first village \
he came to. On this the curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would \
make a fair copy of it. Sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the \
note-book but could not find it, nor, if he had been searching until now, \
could he have found it, for Don Quixote had kept it, and had never given it \
to him, nor had he himself thought of asking for it. When Sancho discovered \
he could not find the book his face grew deadly pale, and in great haste he \
again felt his body all over, and seeing plainly it was not to be found, \
without more ado he seized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of \
it, and then, as quick as he could and without stopping, gave himself half a \
dozen cuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood. Seeing this, \
the curate and the barber asked him what had happened him that he gave \
himself such rough treatment. \"What should happen me?\" replied Sancho, \
\"but to have lost from one hand to the other, in a moment, three ass-colts, \
each of them like a castle?\" \"How is that?\" said the barber. \"I have lost \
the note-book,\" said Sancho, \"that contained the letter to Dulcinea, and an \
order signed by my master in which he directed his niece to give me three \
ass-colts out of four or five he had at home;\" and he then told them about \
the loss of Dapple. The curate consoled him, telling him that when his master \
was found he would get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on \
paper, as was usual and customary; for those made in notebooks were never \
accepted or honoured. Sancho comforted himself with this, and said if that \
were so the loss of Dulcinea's letter did not trouble him much, for he had it \
almost by heart, and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever \
they liked. \"Repeat it then, Sancho,\" said the barber, \"and we will write \
it down afterwards.\" Sancho Panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back \
the letter to his memory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the \
other, one moment staring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after \
having half gnawed off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting \
for him to begin, he said, after a long pause, \"By God, senor licentiate, \
devil a thing can I recollect of the letter; but it said at the beginning, \
'Exalted and scrubbing Lady.'\" \"It cannot have said 'scrubbing,'\" said the \
barber, \"but 'superhuman' or 'sovereign.'\" \"That is it,\" said Sancho; \
\"then, as well as I remember, it went on, 'The wounded, and wanting of \
sleep, and the pierced, kisses your worship's hands, ungrateful and very \
unrecognised fair one; and it said something or other about health and \
sickness that he was sending her; and from that it went tailing off until it \
ended with 'Yours till death, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\" It gave \
them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good memory Sancho had, \
and they complimented him greatly upon it, and begged him to repeat the \
letter a couple of times more, so that they too might get it by heart to \
write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated it three times, and as he did, \
uttered three thousand more absurdities; then he told them more about his \
master but he never said a word about the blanketing that had befallen \
himself in that inn, into which he refused to enter. He told them, moreover, \
how his lord, if he brought him a favourable answer from the lady Dulcinea \
del Toboso, was to put himself in the way of endeavouring to become an \
emperor, or at least a monarch; for it had been so settled between them, and \
with his personal worth and the might of his arm it was an easy matter to \
come to be one: and how on becoming one his lord was to make a marriage for \
him (for he would be a widower by that time, as a matter of course) and was \
to give him as a wife one of the damsels of the empress, the heiress of some \
rich and grand state on the mainland, having nothing to do with islands of \
any sort, for he did not care for them now. All this Sancho delivered with so \
much composure--wiping his nose from time to time--and with so little \
common-sense that his two hearers were again filled with wonder at the force \
of Don Quixote's madness that could run away with this poor man's reason. \
They did not care to take the trouble of disabusing him of his error, as they \
considered that since it did not in any way hurt his conscience it would be \
better to leave him in it, and they would have all the more amusement in \
listening to his simplicities; and so they bade him pray to God for his \
lord's health, as it was a very likely and a very feasible thing for him in \
course of time to come to be an emperor, as he said, or at least an \
archbishop or some other dignitary of equal rank. To which Sancho made \
answer, \"If fortune, sirs, should bring things about in such a way that my \
master should have a mind, instead of being an emperor, to be an archbishop, \
I should like to know what archbishops-errant commonly give their squires?\" \
\"They commonly give them,\" said the curate, some simple benefice or cure, \
or some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income, not \
counting the altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much more.\" \"But for \
that,\" said Sancho, \"the squire must be unmarried, and must know, at any \
rate, how to help at mass, and if that be so, woe is me, for I am married \
already and I don't know the first letter of the A B C. What will become of \
me if my master takes a fancy to be an archbishop and not an emperor, as is \
usual and customary with knights-errant?\" \"Be not uneasy, friend Sancho,\" \
said the barber, \"for we will entreat your master, and advise him, even \
urging it upon him as a case of conscience, to become an emperor and not an \
archbishop, because it will be easier for him as he is more valiant than \
lettered.\" \"So I have thought,\" said Sancho; \"though I can tell you he is \
fit for anything: what I mean to do for my part is to pray to our Lord to \
place him where it may be best for him, and where he may be able to bestow \
most favours upon me.\" \"You speak like a man of sense,\" said the curate, \
\"and you will be acting like a good Christian; but what must now be done is \
to take steps to coax your master out of that useless penance you say he is \
performing; and we had best turn into this inn to consider what plan to \
adopt, and also to dine, for it is now time.\" Sancho said they might go in, \
but that he would wait there outside, and that he would tell them afterwards \
the reason why he was unwilling, and why it did not suit him to enter it; but \
he begged them to bring him out something to eat, and to let it be hot, and \
also to bring barley for Rocinante. They left him and went in, and presently \
the barber brought him out something to eat. By-and-by, after they had \
between them carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their \
object, the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour Don Quixote, \
and effect their purpose; and his notion, which he explained to the barber, \
was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel, while \
the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire, and that they \
should thus proceed to where Don Quixote was, and he, pretending to be an \
aggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour of him, which as a \
valiant knight-errant he could not refuse to grant; and the favour he meant \
to ask him was that he should accompany her whither she would conduct him, in \
order to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had done her, while at the \
same time she should entreat him not to require her to remove her mask, nor \
ask her any question touching her circumstances until he had righted her with \
the wicked knight. And he had no doubt that Don Quixote would comply with any \
request made in these terms, and that in this way they might remove him and \
take him to his own village, where they would endeavour to find out if his \
extraordinary madness admitted of any kind of remedy. CHAPTER XXVII. OF HOW \
THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHER WITH OTHER \
MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORY The curate's plan did not seem \
a bad one to the barber, but on the contrary so good that they immediately \
set about putting it in execution. They begged a petticoat and hood of the \
landlady, leaving her in pledge a new cassock of the curate's; and the barber \
made a beard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to \
stick his comb. The landlady asked them what they wanted these things for, \
and the curate told her in a few words about the madness of Don Quixote, and \
how this disguise was intended to get him away from the mountain where he \
then was. The landlord and landlady immediately came to the conclusion that \
the madman was their guest, the balsam man and master of the blanketed \
squire, and they told the curate all that had passed between him and them, \
not omitting what Sancho had been so silent about. Finally the landlady \
dressed up the curate in a style that left nothing to be desired; she put on \
him a cloth petticoat with black velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, \
and a bodice of green velvet set off by a binding of white satin, which as \
well as the petticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba. The \
curate would not let them hood him, but put on his head a little quilted \
linen cap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his forehead with a strip \
of black silk, while with another he made a mask with which he concealed his \
beard and face very well. He then put on his hat, which was broad enough to \
serve him for an umbrella, and enveloping himself in his cloak seated himself \
woman-fashion on his mule, while the barber mounted his with a beard down to \
the waist of mingled red and white, for it was, as has been said, the tail of \
a clay-red ox. They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, \
sinner as she was, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant \
them success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had in \
hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the curate \
that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, as it was an \
indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even though much \
might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged him to change \
dresses, as it was fitter he should be the distressed damsel, while he \
himself would play the squire's part, which would be less derogatory to his \
dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing more to do with the \
matter, and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came \
up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his \
laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, \
altering their plan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part \
and what to say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and \
give up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance. The \
barber told him he could manage it properly without any instruction, and as \
he did not care to dress himself up until they were near where Don Quixote \
was, he folded up the garments, and the curate adjusted his beard, and they \
set out under the guidance of Sancho Panza, who went along telling them of \
the encounter with the madman they met in the Sierra, saying nothing, \
however, about the finding of the valise and its contents; for with all his \
simplicity the lad was a trifle covetous. The next day they reached the place \
where Sancho had laid the broom-branches as marks to direct him to where he \
had left his master, and recognising it he told them that here was the \
entrance, and that they would do well to dress themselves, if that was \
required to deliver his master; for they had already told him that going in \
this guise and dressing in this way were of the highest importance in order \
to rescue his master from the pernicious life he had adopted; and they \
charged him strictly not to tell his master who they were, or that he knew \
them, and should he ask, as ask he would, if he had given the letter to \
Dulcinea, to say that he had, and that, as she did not know how to read, she \
had given an answer by word of mouth, saying that she commanded him, on pain \
of her displeasure, to come and see her at once; and it was a very important \
matter for himself, because in this way and with what they meant to say to \
him they felt sure of bringing him back to a better mode of life and inducing \
him to take immediate steps to become an emperor or monarch, for there was no \
fear of his becoming an archbishop. All this Sancho listened to and fixed it \
well in his memory, and thanked them heartily for intending to recommend his \
master to be an emperor instead of an archbishop, for he felt sure that in \
the way of bestowing rewards on their squires emperors could do more than \
archbishops-errant. He said, too, that it would be as well for him to go on \
before them to find him, and give him his lady's answer; for that perhaps \
might be enough to bring him away from the place without putting them to all \
this trouble. They approved of what Sancho proposed, and resolved to wait for \
him until he brought back word of having found his master. Sancho pushed on \
into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one through which there flowed \
a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocks and trees afforded a cool and \
grateful shade. It was an August day with all the heat of one, and the heat \
in those parts is intense, and the hour was three in the afternoon, all which \
made the spot the more inviting and tempted them to wait there for Sancho's \
return, which they did. They were reposing, then, in the shade, when a voice \
unaccompanied by the notes of any instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its \
tone, reached their ears, at which they were not a little astonished, as the \
place did not seem to them likely quarters for one who sang so well; for \
though it is often said that shepherds of rare voice are to be found in the \
woods and fields, this is rather a flight of the poet's fancy than the truth. \
And still more surprised were they when they perceived that what they heard \
sung were the verses not of rustic shepherds, but of the polished wits of the \
city; and so it proved, for the verses they heard were these: What makes my \
quest of happiness seem vain? Disdain. What bids me to abandon hope of ease? \
Jealousies. What holds my heart in anguish of suspense? Absence. If that be \
so, then for my grief Where shall I turn to seek relief, When hope on every \
side lies slain By Absence, Jealousies, Disdain? What the prime cause of all \
my woe doth prove? Love. What at my glory ever looks askance? Chance. Whence \
is permission to afflict me given? Heaven. If that be so, I but await The \
stroke of a resistless fate, Since, working for my woe, these three, Love, \
Chance and Heaven, in league I see. What must I do to find a remedy? Die. \
What is the lure for love when coy and strange? Change. What, if all fail, \
will cure the heart of sadness? Madness. If that be so, it is but folly To \
seek a cure for melancholy: Ask where it lies; the answer saith In Change, in \
Madness, or in Death. The hour, the summer season, the solitary place, the \
voice and skill of the singer, all contributed to the wonder and delight of \
the two listeners, who remained still waiting to hear something more; \
finding, however, that the silence continued some little time, they resolved \
to go in search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just as \
they were about to do so they were checked by the same voice, which once more \
fell upon their ears, singing this SONNET When heavenward, holy Friendship, \
thou didst go Soaring to seek thy home beyond the sky, And take thy seat \
among the saints on high, It was thy will to leave on earth below Thy \
semblance, and upon it to bestow Thy veil, wherewith at times hypocrisy, \
Parading in thy shape, deceives the eye, And makes its vileness bright as \
virtue show. Friendship, return to us, or force the cheat That wears it now, \
thy livery to restore, By aid whereof sincerity is slain. If thou wilt not \
unmask thy counterfeit, This earth will be the prey of strife once more, As \
when primaeval discord held its reign. The song ended with a deep sigh, and \
again the listeners remained waiting attentively for the singer to resume; \
but perceiving that the music had now turned to sobs and heart-rending moans \
they determined to find out who the unhappy being could be whose voice was as \
rare as his sighs were piteous, and they had not proceeded far when on \
turning the corner of a rock they discovered a man of the same aspect and \
appearance as Sancho had described to them when he told them the story of \
Cardenio. He, showing no astonishment when he saw them, stood still with his \
head bent down upon his breast like one in deep thought, without raising his \
eyes to look at them after the first glance when they suddenly came upon him. \
The curate, who was aware of his misfortune and recognised him by the \
description, being a man of good address, approached him and in a few \
sensible words entreated and urged him to quit a life of such misery, lest he \
should end it there, which would be the greatest of all misfortunes. Cardenio \
was then in his right mind, free from any attack of that madness which so \
frequently carried him away, and seeing them dressed in a fashion so unusual \
among the frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing some surprise, \
especially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were a well-known \
matter (for the curate's words gave him to understand as much) so he replied \
to them thus: \"I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose \
care it is to succour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in this \
remote spot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserve it \
not, those who seek to draw me away from this to some better retreat, showing \
me by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably I act in leading the life \
I do; but as they know, that if I escape from this evil I shall fall into \
another still greater, perhaps they will set me down as a weak-minded man, \
or, what is worse, one devoid of reason; nor would it be any wonder, for I \
myself can perceive that the effect of the recollection of my misfortunes is \
so great and works so powerfully to my ruin, that in spite of myself I become \
at times like a stone, without feeling or consciousness; and I come to feel \
the truth of it when they tell me and show me proofs of the things I have \
done when the terrible fit overmasters me; and all I can do is bewail my lot \
in vain, and idly curse my destiny, and plead for my madness by telling how \
it was caused, to any that care to hear it; for no reasonable beings on \
learning the cause will wonder at the effects; and if they cannot help me at \
least they will not blame me, and the repugnance they feel at my wild ways \
will turn into pity for my woes. If it be, sirs, that you are here with the \
same design as others have come wah, before you proceed with your wise \
arguments, I entreat you to hear the story of my countless misfortunes, for \
perhaps when you have heard it you will spare yourselves the trouble you \
would take in offering consolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.\" \
As they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his own lips \
the cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it, promising not to \
do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not wish; and thereupon the \
unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly the same words and manner in \
which he had related it to Don Quixote and the goatherd a few days before, \
when, through Master Elisabad, and Don Quixote's scrupulous observance of \
what was due to chivalry, the tale was left unfinished, as this history has \
already recorded; but now fortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him to \
tell it to the end; and so, coming to the incident of the note which Don \
Fernando had found in the volume of \"Amadis of Gaul,\" Cardenio said that he \
remembered it perfectly and that it was in these words: \"Luscinda to \
Cardenio. \"Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to \
hold you in higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this \
obligation without cost to my honour, you may easily do so. I have a father \
who knows you and loves me dearly, who without putting any constraint on my \
inclination will grant what will be reasonable for you to have, if it be that \
you value me as you say and as I believe you do.\" \"By this letter I was \
induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for my wife, and it was through it \
that Luscinda came to be regarded by Don Fernando as one of the most discreet \
and prudent women of the day, and this letter it was that suggested his \
design of ruining me before mine could be carried into effect. I told Don \
Fernando that all Luscinda's father was waiting for was that mine should ask \
her of him, which I did not dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not \
consent to do so; not because he did not know perfectly well the rank, \
goodness, virtue, and beauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that \
would do honour to any family in Spain, but because I was aware that he did \
not wish me to marry so soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do \
for me. In short, I told him I did not venture to mention it to my father, as \
well on account of that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged me \
though I knew not well what they were, only that it seemed to me that what I \
desired was never to come to pass. To all this Don Fernando answered that he \
would take it upon himself to speak to my father, and persuade him to speak \
to Luscinda's father. O, ambitious Marius! O, cruel Catiline! O, wicked \
Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherous Vellido! O, vindictive Julian! \
O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel, vindictive, and perfidious, wherein had \
this poor wretch failed in his fidelity, who with such frankness showed thee \
the secrets and the joys of his heart? What offence did I commit? What words \
did I utter, or what counsels did I give that had not the furtherance of thy \
honour and welfare for their aim? But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain? \
for sure it is that when misfortunes spring from the stars, descending from \
on high they fall upon us with such fury and violence that no power on earth \
can check their course nor human device stay their coming. Who could have \
thought that Don Fernando, a highborn gentleman, intelligent, bound to me by \
gratitude for my services, one that could win the object of his love wherever \
he might set his affections, could have become so obdurate, as they say, as \
to rob me of my one ewe lamb that was not even yet in my possession? But \
laying aside these useless and unavailing reflections, let us take up the \
broken thread of my unhappy story. \"To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding \
my presence an obstacle to the execution of his treacherous and wicked \
design, resolved to send me to his elder brother under the pretext of asking \
money from him to pay for six horses which, purposely, and with the sole \
object of sending me away that he might the better carry out his infernal \
scheme, he had purchased the very day he offered to speak to my father, and \
the price of which he now desired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated this \
treachery? Could I by any chance have suspected it? Nay; so far from that, I \
offered with the greatest pleasure to go at once, in my satisfaction at the \
good bargain that had been made. That night I spoke with Luscinda, and told \
her what had been agreed upon with Don Fernando, and how I had strong hopes \
of our fair and reasonable wishes being realised. She, as unsuspicious as I \
was of the treachery of Don Fernando, bade me try to return speedily, as she \
believed the fulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my \
father put off speaking to hers. I know not why it was that on saying this to \
me her eyes filled with tears, and there came a lump in her throat that \
prevented her from uttering a word of many more that it seemed to me she was \
striving to say to me. I was astonished at this unusual turn, which I never \
before observed in her. for we always conversed, whenever good fortune and my \
ingenuity gave us the chance, with the greatest gaiety and cheerfulness, \
mingling tears, sighs, jealousies, doubts, or fears with our words; it was \
all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune that Heaven should have given her \
to me for my mistress; I glorified her beauty, I extolled her worth and her \
understanding; and she paid me back by praising in me what in her love for me \
she thought worthy of praise; and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles \
and doings of our neighbours and acquaintances to talk about, and the utmost \
extent of my boldness was to take, almost by force, one of her fair white \
hands and carry it to my lips, as well as the closeness of the low grating \
that separated us allowed me. But the night before the unhappy day of my \
departure she wept, she moaned, she sighed, and she withdrew leaving me \
filled with perplexity and amazement, overwhelmed at the sight of such \
strange and affecting signs of grief and sorrow in Luscinda; but not to dash \
my hopes I ascribed it all to the depth of her love for me and the pain that \
separation gives those who love tenderly. At last I took my departure, sad \
and dejected, my heart filled with fancies and suspicions, but not knowing \
well what it was I suspected or fancied; plain omens pointing to the sad \
event and misfortune that was awaiting me. \"I reached the place whither I \
had been sent, gave the letter to Don Fernando's brother, and was kindly \
received but not promptly dismissed, for he desired me to wait, very much \
against my will, eight days in some place where the duke his father was not \
likely to see me, as his brother wrote that the money was to be sent without \
his knowledge; all of which was a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for \
his brother had no want of money to enable him to despatch me at once. \"The \
command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying it, as it \
seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days separated from \
Luscinda, especially after leaving her in the sorrowful mood I have described \
to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant I obeyed, though I felt it would be \
at the cost of my well-being. But four days later there came a man in quest \
of me with a letter which he gave me, and which by the address I perceived to \
be from Luscinda, as the writing was hers. I opened it with fear and \
trepidation, persuaded that it must be something serious that had impelled \
her to write to me when at a distance, as she seldom did so when I was near. \
Before reading it I asked the man who it was that had given it to him, and \
how long he had been upon the road; he told me that as he happened to be \
passing through one of the streets of the city at the hour of noon, a very \
beautiful lady called to him from a window, and with tears in her eyes said \
to him hurriedly, 'Brother, if you are, as you seem to be, a Christian, for \
the love of God I entreat you to have this letter despatched without a \
moment's delay to the place and person named in the address, all which is \
well known, and by this you will render a great service to our Lord; and that \
you may be at no inconvenience in doing so take what is in this \
handkerchief;' and said he, 'with this she threw me a handkerchief out of the \
window in which were tied up a hundred reals and this gold ring which I bring \
here together with the letter I have given you. And then without waiting for \
any answer she left the window, though not before she saw me take the letter \
and the handkerchief, and I had by signs let her know that I would do as she \
bade me; and so, seeing myself so well paid for the trouble I would have in \
bringing it to you, and knowing by the address that it was to you it was sent \
(for, senor, I know you very well), and also unable to resist that beautiful \
lady's tears, I resolved to trust no one else, but to come myself and give it \
to you, and in sixteen hours from the time when it was given me I have made \
the journey, which, as you know, is eighteen leagues.' \"All the while the \
good-natured improvised courier was telling me this, I hung upon his words, \
my legs trembling under me so that I could scarcely stand. However, I opened \
the letter and read these words: \"'The promise Don Fernando gave you to urge \
your father to speak to mine, he has fulfilled much more to his own \
satisfaction than to your advantage. I have to tell you, senor, that he has \
demanded me for a wife, and my father, led away by what he considers Don \
Fernando's superiority over you, has favoured his suit so cordially, that in \
two days hence the betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so \
privately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavens above and a few of \
the household. Picture to yourself the state I am in; judge if it be urgent \
for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you whether I love you or \
not. God grant this may come to your hand before mine shall be forced to link \
itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he has pledged.' \"Such, in \
brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me set out at once \
without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I now saw clearly that it \
was not the purchase of horses but of his own pleasure that had made Don \
Fernando send me to his brother. The exasperation I felt against Don \
Fernando, joined with the fear of losing the prize I had won by so many years \
of love and devotion, lent me wings; so that almost flying I reached home the \
same day, by the hour which served for speaking with Luscinda. I arrived \
unobserved, and left the mule on which I had come at the house of the worthy \
man who had brought me the letter, and fortune was pleased to be for once so \
kind that I found Luscinda at the grating that was the witness of our loves. \
She recognised me at once, and I her, but not as she ought to have recognised \
me, or I her. But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed \
or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman? Of a truth no \
one. To proceed: as soon as Luscinda saw me she said, 'Cardenio, I am in my \
bridal dress, and the treacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are \
waiting for me in the hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the \
witnesses of my death before they witness my betrothal. Be not distressed, my \
friend, but contrive to be present at this sacrifice, and if that cannot be \
prevented by my words, I have a dagger concealed which will prevent more \
deliberate violence, putting an end to my life and giving thee a first proof \
of the love I have borne and bear thee.' I replied to her distractedly and \
hastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply, 'May thy words be \
verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast a dagger to save thy honour, I \
have a sword to defend thee or kill myself if fortune be against us.' \"I \
think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived that they \
called her away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting. Now the night of my \
sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt my eyes bereft of \
sight, my mind of reason. I could not enter the house, nor was I capable of \
any movement; but reflecting how important it was that I should be present at \
what might take place on the occasion, I nerved myself as best I could and \
went in, for I well knew all the entrances and outlets; and besides, with the \
confusion that in secret pervaded the house no one took notice of me, so, \
without being seen, I found an opportunity of placing myself in the recess \
formed by a window of the hall itself, and concealed by the ends and borders \
of two tapestries, from between which I could, without being seen, see all \
that took place in the room. Who could describe the agitation of heart I \
suffered as I stood there--the thoughts that came to me--the reflections that \
passed through my mind? They were such as cannot be, nor were it well they \
should be, told. Suffice it to say that the bridegroom entered the hall in \
his usual dress, without ornament of any kind; as groomsman he had with him a \
cousin of Luscinda's and except the servants of the house there was no one \
else in the chamber. Soon afterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber, \
attended by her mother and two of her damsels, arrayed and adorned as became \
her rank and beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire. My anxiety \
and distraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly what she \
wore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson and white, and \
the glitter of the gems and jewels on her head dress and apparel, surpassed \
by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vying with the precious \
stones and the light of the four torches that stood in the hall shone with a \
brighter gleam than all. Oh memory, mortal foe of my peace! why bring before \
me now the incomparable beauty of that adored enemy of mine? Were it not \
better, cruel memory, to remind me and recall what she then did, that stirred \
by a wrong so glaring I may seek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid \
myself of life? Be not weary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my \
sorrow is not one of those that can or should be told tersely and briefly, \
for to me each incident seems to call for many words.\" To this the curate \
replied that not only were they not weary of listening to him, but that the \
details he mentioned interested them greatly, being of a kind by no means to \
be omitted and deserving of the same attention as the main story. \"To \
proceed, then,\" continued Cardenio: \"all being assembled in the hall, the \
priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the hand to perform \
the requisite ceremony, at the words, 'Will you, Senora Luscinda, take Senor \
Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful husband, as the holy Mother \
Church ordains?' I thrust my head and neck out from between the tapestries, \
and with eager ears and throbbing heart set myself to listen to Luscinda's \
answer, awaiting in her reply the sentence of death or the grant of life. Oh, \
that I had but dared at that moment to rush forward crying aloud, 'Luscinda, \
Luscinda! have a care what thou dost; remember what thou owest me; bethink \
thee thou art mine and canst not be another's; reflect that thy utterance of \
\"Yes\" and the end of my life will come at the same instant. O, treacherous \
Don Fernando! robber of my glory, death of my life! What seekest thou? \
Remember that thou canst not as a Christian attain the object of thy wishes, \
for Luscinda is my bride, and I am her husband!' Fool that I am! now that I \
am far away, and out of danger, I say I should have done what I did not do: \
now that I have allowed my precious treasure to be robbed from me, I curse \
the robber, on whom I might have taken vengeance had I as much heart for it \
as I have for bewailing my fate; in short, as I was then a coward and a fool, \
little wonder is it if I am now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and mad. \
\"The priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a long time \
withheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the dagger to save her \
honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of the truth on my \
behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, 'I will:' Don Fernando \
said the same, and giving her the ring they stood linked by a knot that could \
never be loosed. The bridegroom then approached to embrace his bride; and \
she, pressing her hand upon her heart, fell fainting in her mother's arms. It \
only remains now for me to tell you the state I was in when in that consent \
that I heard I saw all my hopes mocked, the words and promises of Luscinda \
proved falsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I had that instant lost \
rendered impossible for ever. I stood stupefied, wholly abandoned, it seemed, \
by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earth that bore me, the air refusing me \
breath for my sighs, the water moisture for my tears; it was only the fire \
that gathered strength so that my whole frame glowed with rage and jealousy. \
They were all thrown into confusion by Luscinda's fainting, and as her mother \
was unlacing her to give her air a sealed paper was discovered in her bosom \
which Don Fernando seized at once and began to read by the light of one of \
the torches. As soon as he had read it he seated himself in a chair, leaning \
his cheek on his hand in the attitude of one deep in thought, without taking \
any part in the efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her \
fainting fit. \"Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out \
regardless whether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to do some \
frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous indignation of \
my breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don Fernando, and even in that \
of the fickle fainting traitress. But my fate, doubtless reserving me for \
greater sorrows, if such there be, so ordered it that just then I had enough \
and to spare of that reason which has since been wanting to me; and so, \
without seeking to take vengeance on my greatest enemies (which might have \
been easily taken, as all thought of me was so far from their minds), I \
resolved to take it upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain they \
deserved, perhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt out to \
them had I then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over, but that which is \
protracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life. In a word, I \
quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom I had left my mule; I \
made him saddle it for me, mounted without bidding him farewell, and rode out \
of the city, like another Lot, not daring to turn my head to look back upon \
it; and when I found myself alone in the open country, screened by the \
darkness of the night, and tempted by the stillness to give vent to my grief \
without apprehension or fear of being heard or seen, then I broke silence and \
lifted up my voice in maledictions upon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if I \
could thus avenge the wrong they had done me. I called her cruel, ungrateful, \
false, thankless, but above all covetous, since the wealth of my enemy had \
blinded the eyes of her affection, and turned it from me to transfer it to \
one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal. And yet, in the midst \
of this outburst of execration and upbraiding, I found excuses for her, \
saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the seclusion of her parents' \
house, trained and schooled to obey them always, should have been ready to \
yield to their wishes when they offered her for a husband a gentleman of such \
distinction, wealth, and noble birth, that if she had refused to accept him \
she would have been thought out of her senses, or to have set her affection \
elsewhere, a suspicion injurious to her fair name and fame. But then again, I \
said, had she declared I was her husband, they would have seen that in \
choosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her, for \
before Don Fernando had made his offer, they themselves could not have \
desired, if their desires had been ruled by reason, a more eligible husband \
for their daughter than I was; and she, before taking the last fatal step of \
giving her hand, might easily have said that I had already given her mine, \
for I should have come forward to support any assertion of hers to that \
effect. In short, I came to the conclusion that feeble love, little \
reflection, great ambition, and a craving for rank, had made her forget the \
words with which she had deceived me, encouraged and supported by my firm \
hopes and honourable passion. \"Thus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed \
onward for the remainder of the night, and by daybreak I reached one of the \
passes of these mountains, among which I wandered for three days more without \
taking any path or road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not \
which side of the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in what \
direction the most rugged part of the range lay. They told me that it was in \
this quarter, and I at once directed my course hither, intending to end my \
life here; but as I was making my way among these crags, my mule dropped dead \
through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think more likely, in order to have done \
with such a worthless burden as it bore in me. I was left on foot, worn out, \
famishing, without anyone to help me or any thought of seeking help: and so \
thus I lay stretched on the ground, how long I know not, after which I rose \
up free from hunger, and found beside me some goatherds, who no doubt were \
the persons who had relieved me in my need, for they told me how they had \
found me, and how I had been uttering ravings that showed plainly I had lost \
my reason; and since then I am conscious that I am not always in full \
possession of it, but at times so deranged and crazed that I do a thousand \
mad things, tearing my clothes, crying aloud in these solitudes, cursing my \
fate, and idly calling on the dear name of her who is my enemy, and only \
seeking to end my life in lamentation; and when I recover my senses I find \
myself so exhausted and weary that I can scarcely move. Most commonly my \
dwelling is the hollow of a cork tree large enough to shelter this miserable \
body; the herdsmen and goatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by \
compassion, furnish me with food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, \
where they think I may perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be \
then out of my senses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to \
sustain me, and make me crave it and eager to take it. At other times, so \
they tell me when they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon the road, \
and though they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by force from the \
shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts. Thus do pass the \
wretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven's will to bring it to a \
close, or so to order my memory that I no longer recollect the beauty and \
treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me by Don Fernando; for if it will \
do this without depriving me of life, I will turn my thoughts into some \
better channel; if not, I can only implore it to have full mercy on my soul, \
for in myself I feel no power or strength to release my body from this strait \
in which I have of my own accord chosen to place it. \"Such, sirs, is the \
dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one that can be told with less \
emotion than you have seen in me; and do not trouble yourselves with urging \
or pressing upon me what reason suggests as likely to serve for my relief, \
for it will avail me as much as the medicine prescribed by a wise physician \
avails the sick man who will not take it. I have no wish for health without \
Luscinda; and since it is her pleasure to be another's, when she is or should \
be mine, let it be mine to be a prey to misery when I might have enjoyed \
happiness. She by her fickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will \
strive to gratify her wishes by seeking destruction; and it will show \
generations to come that I alone was deprived of that of which all others in \
misfortune have a superabundance, for to them the impossibility of being \
consoled is itself a consolation, while to me it is the cause of greater \
sorrows and sufferings, for I think that even in death there will not be an \
end of them.\" Here Cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story, \
as full of misfortune as it was of love; but just as the curate was going to \
address some words of comfort to him, he was stopped by a voice that reached \
his ear, saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the Fourth Part of \
this narrative; for at this point the sage and sagacious historian, Cide \
Hamete Benengeli, brought the Third to a conclusion. CHAPTER XXVIII. WHICH \
TREATS OF THE STRANGE AND DELIGHTFUL ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL THE CURATE AND THE \
BARBER IN THE SAME SIERRA Happy and fortunate were the times when that most \
daring knight Don Quixote of La Mancha was sent into the world; for by reason \
of his having formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive \
and restore to the world the long-lost and almost defunct order of \
knight-errantry, we now enjoy in this age of ours, so poor in light \
entertainment, not only the charm of his veracious history, but also of the \
tales and episodes contained in it which are, in a measure, no less pleasing, \
ingenious, and truthful, than the history itself; which, resuming its thread, \
carded, spun, and wound, relates that just as the curate was going to offer \
consolation to Cardenio, he was interrupted by a voice that fell upon his ear \
saying in plaintive tones: \"O God! is it possible I have found a place that \
may serve as a secret grave for the weary load of this body that I support so \
unwillingly? If the solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is \
so; ah! woe is me! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of \
these rocks and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven, \
than that of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to for \
counsel in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!\" All this was \
heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and as it seemed to them \
to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got up to look for the \
speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces they discovered behind a rock, \
seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth in the dress of a peasant, whose \
face they were unable at the moment to see as he was leaning forward, bathing \
his feet in the brook that flowed past. They approached so silently that he \
did not perceive them, being fully occupied in bathing his feet, which were \
so fair that they looked like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth \
among the other stones of the brook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet \
struck them with surprise, for they did not seem to have been made to crush \
clods or to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner's dress suggested; \
and so, finding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was in front, made \
a sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock \
that lay there; which they did, observing closely what the youth was about. \
He had on a loose double-skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to his body \
with a white cloth; he wore besides breeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and \
on his head a brown montera; and he had the gaiters turned up as far as the \
middle of the leg, which verily seemed to be of pure alabaster. As soon as he \
had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with a towel he took from \
under the montera, on taking off which he raised his face, and those who were \
watching him had an opportunity of seeing a beauty so exquisite that Cardenio \
said to the curate in a whisper: \"As this is not Luscinda, it is no human \
creature but a divine being.\" The youth then took off the montera, and \
shaking his head from side to side there broke loose and spread out a mass of \
hair that the beams of the sun might have envied; by this they knew that what \
had seemed a peasant was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of \
two of them had ever beheld, or even Cardenio's if they had not seen and \
known Luscinda, for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscinda \
could compare with this. The long auburn tresses not only covered her \
shoulders, but such was their length and abundance, concealed her all round \
beneath their masses, so that except the feet nothing of her form was \
visible. She now used her hands as a comb, and if her feet had seemed like \
bits of crystal in the water, her hands looked like pieces of driven snow \
among her locks; all which increased not only the admiration of the three \
beholders, but their anxiety to learn who she was. With this object they \
resolved to show themselves, and at the stir they made in getting upon their \
feet the fair damsel raised her head, and parting her hair from before her \
eyes with both hands, she looked to see who had made the noise, and the \
instant she perceived them she started to her feet, and without waiting to \
put on her shoes or gather up her hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as \
though of clothes that she had beside her, and, scared and alarmed, \
endeavoured to take flight; but before she had gone six paces she fell to the \
ground, her delicate feet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; \
seeing which, the three hastened towards her, and the curate addressing her \
first said: \"Stay, senora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here \
only desire to be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight so \
heedless, for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.\" Taken by \
surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words. They, however, \
came towards her, and the curate taking her hand went on to say: \"What your \
dress would hide, senora, is made known to us by your hair; a clear proof \
that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your beauty in a garb so \
unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like these where we have had the \
good fortune to find you, if not to relieve your distress, at least to offer \
you comfort; for no distress, so long as life lasts, can be so oppressive or \
reach such a height as to make the sufferer refuse to listen to comfort \
offered with good intention. And so, senora, or senor, or whatever you prefer \
to be, dismiss the fears that our appearance has caused you and make us \
acquainted with your good or evil fortunes, for from all of us together, or \
from each one of us, you will receive sympathy in your trouble.\" While the \
curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as if spell-bound, looking at \
them without opening her lips or uttering a word, just like a village rustic \
to whom something strange that he has never seen before has been suddenly \
shown; but on the curate addressing some further words to the same effect to \
her, sighing deeply she broke silence and said: \"Since the solitude of these \
mountains has been unable to conceal me, and the escape of my dishevelled \
tresses will not allow my tongue to deal in falsehoods, it would be idle for \
me now to make any further pretence of what, if you were to believe me, you \
would believe more out of courtesy than for any other reason. This being so, \
I say I thank you, sirs, for the offer you have made me, which places me \
under the obligation of complying with the request you have made of me; \
though I fear the account I shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in \
you as much concern as compassion, for you will be unable to suggest anything \
to remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them. However, that my honour \
may not be left a matter of doubt in your minds, now that you have discovered \
me to be a woman, and see that I am young, alone, and in this dress, things \
that taken together or separately would be enough to destroy any good name, I \
feel bound to tell what I would willingly keep secret if I could.\" All this \
she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without any hesitation, \
with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were not less charmed by \
her intelligence than by her beauty, and as they again repeated their offers \
and entreaties to her to fulfil her promise, she without further pressing, \
first modestly covering her feet and gathering up her hair, seated herself on \
a stone with the three placed around her, and, after an effort to restrain \
some tears that came to her eyes, in a clear and steady voice began her story \
thus: \"In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title \
which makes him one of those that are called Grandees of Spain. This nobleman \
has two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to his good \
qualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be the treachery of \
Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon. My parents are this lord's vassals, \
lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had conferred as much on them \
as fortune, they would have had nothing left to desire, nor should I have had \
reason to fear trouble like that in which I find myself now; for it may be \
that my ill fortune came of theirs in not having been nobly born. It is true \
they are not so low that they have any reason to be ashamed of their \
condition, but neither are they so high as to remove from my mind the \
impression that my mishap comes of their humble birth. They are, in short, \
peasants, plain homely people, without any taint of disreputable blood, and, \
as the saying is, old rusty Christians, but so rich that by their wealth and \
free-handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be considered \
gentlefolk by birth, and even by position; though the wealth and nobility \
they thought most of was having me for their daughter; and as they have no \
other child to make their heir, and are affectionate parents, I was one of \
the most indulged daughters that ever parents indulged. \"I was the mirror in \
which they beheld themselves, the staff of their old age, and the object in \
which, with submission to Heaven, all their wishes centred, and mine were in \
accordance with theirs, for I knew their worth; and as I was mistress of \
their hearts, so was I also of their possessions. Through me they engaged or \
dismissed their servants; through my hands passed the accounts and returns of \
what was sown and reaped; the oil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the \
flocks and herds, the beehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my \
father has or can have, I had under my care, and I acted as steward and \
mistress with an assiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I \
cannot well describe to you. The leisure hours left to me after I had given \
the requisite orders to the head-shepherds, overseers, and other labourers, I \
passed in such employments as are not only allowable but necessary for young \
girls, those that the needle, embroidery cushion, and spinning wheel usually \
afford, and if to refresh my mind I quitted them for a while, I found \
recreation in reading some devotional book or playing the harp, for \
experience taught me that music soothes the troubled mind and relieves \
weariness of spirit. Such was the life I led in my parents' house and if I \
have depicted it thus minutely, it is not out of ostentation, or to let you \
know that I am rich, but that you may see how, without any fault of mine, I \
have fallen from the happy condition I have described, to the misery I am in \
at present. The truth is, that while I was leading this busy life, in a \
retirement that might compare with that of a monastery, and unseen as I \
thought by any except the servants of the house (for when I went to Mass it \
was so early in the morning, and I was so closely attended by my mother and \
the women of the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that my eyes \
scarcely saw more ground than I trod on), in spite of all this, the eyes of \
love, or idleness, more properly speaking, that the lynx's cannot rival, \
discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of Don Fernando; for that is \
the name of the younger son of the duke I told of.\" The moment the speaker \
mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio changed colour and broke into a \
sweat, with such signs of emotion that the curate and the barber, who \
observed it, feared that one of the mad fits which they heard attacked him \
sometimes was coming upon him; but Cardenio showed no further agitation and \
remained quiet, regarding the peasant girl with fixed attention, for he began \
to suspect who she was. She, however, without noticing the excitement of \
Cardenio, continuing her story, went on to say: \"And they had hardly \
discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, he was smitten with a violent \
love for me, as the manner in which it displayed itself plainly showed. But \
to shorten the long recital of my woes, I will pass over in silence all the \
artifices employed by Don Fernando for declaring his passion for me. He \
bribed all the household, he gave and offered gifts and presents to my \
parents; every day was like a holiday or a merry-making in our street; by \
night no one could sleep for the music; the love letters that used to come to \
my hand, no one knew how, were innumerable, full of tender pleadings and \
pledges, containing more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; \
all which not only did not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as \
if he had been my mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me yield \
were done with the opposite intention. Not that the high-bred bearing of Don \
Fernando was disagreeable to me, or that I found his importunities wearisome; \
for it gave me a certain sort of satisfaction to find myself so sought and \
prized by a gentleman of such distinction, and I was not displeased at seeing \
my praises in his letters (for however ugly we women may be, it seems to me \
it always pleases us to hear ourselves called beautiful) but that my own \
sense of right was opposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice of my \
parents, who now very plainly perceived Don Fernando's purpose, for he cared \
very little if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted and confided \
their honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and bade me \
consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from which I might \
conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to the contrary, had for \
their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage; and if I were at all \
desirous of opposing an obstacle to his unreasonable suit, they were ready, \
they said, to marry me at once to anyone I preferred, either among the \
leading people of our own town, or of any of those in the neighbourhood; for \
with their wealth and my good name, a match might be looked for in any \
quarter. This offer, and their sound advice strengthened my resolution, and I \
never gave Don Fernando a word in reply that could hold out to him any hope \
of success, however remote. \"All this caution of mine, which he must have \
taken for coyness, had apparently the effect of increasing his wanton \
appetite--for that is the name I give to his passion for me; had it been what \
he declared it to be, you would not know of it now, because there would have \
been no occasion to tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents were \
contemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of \
obtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors to \
watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as you shall \
hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other companion than a damsel \
who waited on me, with the doors carefully locked lest my honour should be \
imperilled through any carelessness, I know not nor can conceive how it \
happened, but, with all this seclusion and these precautions, and in the \
solitude and silence of my retirement, I found him standing before me, a \
vision that so astounded me that it deprived my eyes of sight, and my tongue \
of speech. I had no power to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he give me time \
to utter one, as he immediately approached me, and taking me in his arms \
(for, overwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help myself), he began \
to make such professions to me that I know not how falsehood could have had \
the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and the traitor \
contrived that his tears should vouch for his words, and his sighs for his \
sincerity. \"I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in \
cases such as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying \
protestations true, though without being moved by his sighs and tears to \
anything more than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of \
bewilderment passed away, and I began in some degree to recover myself, I \
said to him with more courage than I thought I could have possessed, 'If, as \
I am now in your arms, senor, I were in the claws of a fierce lion, and my \
deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything to the prejudice of \
my honour, it would no more be in my power to do it or say it, than it would \
be possible that what was should not have been; so then, if you hold my body \
clasped in your arms, I hold my soul secured by virtuous intentions, very \
different from yours, as you will see if you attempt to carry them into \
effect by force. I am your vassal, but I am not your slave; your nobility \
neither has nor should have any right to dishonour or degrade my humble \
birth; and low-born peasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much as you, a \
lord and gentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose, your wealth \
will have no weight, your words will have no power to deceive me, nor your \
sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the things I speak of in \
him whom my parents gave me as a husband, his will should be mine, and mine \
should be bounded by his; and my honour being preserved even though my \
inclinations were not would willingly yield him what you, senor, would now \
obtain by force; and this I say lest you should suppose that any but my \
lawful husband shall ever win anything of me.' 'If that,' said this disloyal \
gentleman, 'be the only scruple you feel, fairest Dorothea' (for that is the \
name of this unhappy being), 'see here I give you my hand to be yours, and \
let Heaven, from which nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have \
here, be witnesses of this pledge.'\" When Cardenio heard her say she was \
called Dorothea, he showed fresh agitation and felt convinced of the truth of \
his former suspicion, but he was unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished \
to hear the end of what he already all but knew, so he merely said: \"What! \
is Dorothea your name, senora? I have heard of another of the same name who \
can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed; by-and-by I may tell you \
something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your compassion.\" \
Dorothea was struck by Cardenio's words as well as by his strange and \
miserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to tell \
it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it was courage to \
bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt sure that none could \
reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she endured already. \"I \
would not let the occasion pass, senora,\" replied Cardenio, \"of telling you \
what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far there has been no \
opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to know it.\" \"Be it as it \
may,\" replied Dorothea, \"what happened in my story was that Don Fernando, \
taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it as a witness of our \
betrothal, and with the most binding words and extravagant oaths gave me his \
promise to become my husband; though before he had made an end of pledging \
himself I bade him consider well what he was doing, and think of the anger \
his father would feel at seeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his \
vassals; I told him not to let my beauty, such as it was, blind him, for that \
was not enough to furnish an excuse for his transgression; and if in the love \
he bore me he wished to do me any kindness, it would be to leave my lot to \
follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriages so \
unequal never brought happiness, nor did they continue long to afford the \
enjoyment they began with. \"All this that I have now repeated I said to him, \
and much more which I cannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him \
to forego his purpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble \
himself about difficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time \
I argued the matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, 'I shall not be \
the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station, nor \
will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more likely, a blind \
attachment, has led to mate himself below his rank. Then, since I am \
introducing no new usage or practice, I may as well avail myself of the \
honour that chance offers me, for even though his inclination for me should \
not outlast the attainment of his wishes, I shall be, after all, his wife \
before God. And if I strive to repel him by scorn, I can see that, fair means \
failing, he is in a mood to use force, and I shall be left dishonoured and \
without any means of proving my innocence to those who cannot know how \
innocently I have come to be in this position; for what arguments would \
persuade my parents that this gentleman entered my chamber without my \
consent?' \"All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a \
moment; but the oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the \
tears he shed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace, \
which, accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have conquered a \
heart even more free and coy than mine--these were the things that more than \
all began to influence me and lead me unawares to my ruin. I called my \
waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness on earth besides those in \
Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and repeated his oaths, invoked as \
witnesses fresh saints in addition to the former ones, called down upon \
himself a thousand curses hereafter should he fail to keep his promise, shed \
more tears, redoubled his sighs and pressed me closer in his arms, from which \
he had never allowed me to escape; and so I was left by my maid, and ceased \
to be one, and he became a traitor and a perjured man. \"The day which \
followed the night of my misfortune did not come so quickly, I imagine, as \
Don Fernando wished, for when desire has attained its object, the greatest \
pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure. I say so because Don Fernando \
made all haste to leave me, and by the adroitness of my maid, who was indeed \
the one who had admitted him, gained the street before daybreak; but on \
taking leave of me he told me, though not with as much earnestness and \
fervour as when he came, that I might rest assured of his faith and of the \
sanctity and sincerity of his oaths; and to confirm his words he drew a rich \
ring off his finger and placed it upon mine. He then took his departure and I \
was left, I know not whether sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I was left \
agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place, \
and I had not the spirit, or else it did not occur to me, to chide my maid \
for the treachery she had been guilty of in concealing Don Fernando in my \
chamber; for as yet I was unable to make up my mind whether what had befallen \
me was for good or evil. I told Don Fernando at parting, that as I was now \
his, he might see me on other nights in the same way, until it should be his \
pleasure to let the matter become known; but, except the following night, he \
came no more, nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of him in the \
street or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one; although I \
knew he was in the town, and almost every day went out hunting, a pastime he \
was very fond of. I remember well how sad and dreary those days and hours \
were to me; I remember well how I began to doubt as they went by, and even to \
lose confidence in the faith of Don Fernando; and I remember, too, how my \
maid heard those words in reproof of her audacity that she had not heard \
before, and how I was forced to put a constraint on my tears and on the \
expression of my countenance, not to give my parents cause to ask me why I \
was so melancholy, and drive me to invent falsehoods in reply. But all this \
was suddenly brought to an end, for the time came when all such \
considerations were disregarded, and there was no further question of honour, \
when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad. The \
reason was, that a few days later it was reported in the town that Don \
Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rare beauty, \
the daughter of parents of distinguished position, though not so rich that \
her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a match; it was said, \
too, that her name was Luscinda, and that at the betrothal some strange \
things had happened.\" Cardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only \
shrugged his shoulders, bit his lips, bent his brows, and before long two \
streams of tears escaped from his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt \
her story, but went on in these words: \"This sad intelligence reached my \
ears, and, instead of being struck with a chill, with such wrath and fury did \
my heart burn that I scarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the \
streets, crying aloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of \
which I was the victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked \
by a resolution I formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to \
assume this dress, which I got from a servant of my father's, one of the \
zagals, as they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the whole of my \
misfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the city where I heard my \
enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me for my boldness, and condemned \
my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my purpose, offered to bear me \
company, as he said, to the end of the world. I at once packed up in a linen \
pillow-case a woman's dress, and some jewels and money to provide for \
emergencies, and in the silence of the night, without letting my treacherous \
maid know, I sallied forth from the house, accompanied by my servant and \
abundant anxieties, and on foot set out for the city, but borne as it were on \
wings by my eagerness to reach it, if not to prevent what I presumed to be \
already done, at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with what \
conscience he had done it. I reached my destination in two days and a half, \
and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda's parents. The \
first person I asked gave me more in reply than I sought to know; he showed \
me the house, and told me all that had occurred at the betrothal of the \
daughter of the family, an affair of such notoriety in the city that it was \
the talk of every knot of idlers in the street. He said that on the night of \
Don Fernando's betrothal with Luscinda, as soon as she had consented to be \
his bride by saying 'Yes,' she was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that \
on the bridegroom approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her \
air, he found a paper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared \
that she could not be Don Fernando's bride, because she was already \
Cardenio's, who, according to the man's account, was a gentleman of \
distinction of the same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it \
was only in obedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the \
paper made it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the \
betrothal, and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which was \
confirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her clothes. On \
seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had befooled, slighted, \
and trifled with him, assailed her before she had recovered from her swoon, \
and tried to stab her with the dagger that had been found, and would have \
succeeded had not her parents and those who were present prevented him. It \
was said, moreover, that Don Fernando went away at once, and that Luscinda \
did not recover from her prostration until the next day, when she told her \
parents how she was really the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I \
learned besides that Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the \
betrothal; and that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation, he \
had quitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring the \
wrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no one should \
ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the city, and \
everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that Luscinda was \
missing from her father's house and from the city, for she was not to be \
found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who knew not what steps to \
take to recover her. What I learned revived my hopes, and I was better \
pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to find him married, for it \
seemed to me that the door was not yet entirely shut upon relief in my case, \
and I thought that perhaps Heaven had put this impediment in the way of the \
second marriage, to lead him to recognise his obligations under the former \
one, and reflect that as a Christian he was bound to consider his soul above \
all human objects. All this passed through my mind, and I strove to comfort \
myself without comfort, indulging in faint and distant hopes of cherishing \
that life that I now abhor. \"But while I was in the city, uncertain what to \
do, as I could not find Don Fernando, I heard notice given by the public \
crier offering a great reward to anyone who should find me, and giving the \
particulars of my age and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that \
the lad who came with me had taken me away from my father's house; a thing \
that cut me to the heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it \
was not enough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with \
whom I had fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my \
consideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with my \
servant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to me, and \
the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most thickly wooded \
part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one evil calls up another \
and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the beginning of one still \
greater, and so it proved in my case; for my worthy servant, until then so \
faithful and trusty when he found me in this lonely spot, moved more by his \
own villainy than by my beauty, sought to take advantage of the opportunity \
which these solitudes seemed to present him, and with little shame and less \
fear of God and respect for me, began to make overtures to me; and finding \
that I replied to the effrontery of his proposals with justly severe \
language, he laid aside the entreaties which he had employed at first, and \
began to use violence. \"But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and \
aid good intentions, so aided mine that with my slight strength and with \
little exertion I pushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead \
or alive I know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible in my \
terror and fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without any other \
thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and escaping my \
father and those despatched in search of me by his orders. It is now I know \
not how many months since with this object I came here, where I met a \
herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place in the heart of this \
Sierra, and all this time I have been serving him as herd, striving to keep \
always afield to hide these locks which have now unexpectedly betrayed me. \
But all my care and pains were unavailing, for my master made the discovery \
that I was not a man, and harboured the same base designs as my servant; and \
as fortune does not always supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, and I had \
no precipice or ravine at hand down which to fling the master and cure his \
passion, as I had in the servant's case, I thought it a lesser evil to leave \
him and again conceal myself among these crags, than make trial of my \
strength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I went into hiding to \
seek for some place where I might with sighs and tears implore Heaven to have \
pity on my misery, and grant me help and strength to escape from it, or let \
me die among the solitudes, leaving no trace of an unhappy being who, by no \
fault of hers, has furnished matter for talk and scandal at home and \
abroad.\" CHAPTER XXIX. WHICH TREATS OF THE DROLL DEVICE AND METHOD ADOPTED \
TO EXTRICATE OUR LOVE-STRICKEN KNIGHT FROM THE SEVERE PENANCE HE HAD IMPOSED \
UPON HIMSELF \"Such, sirs, is the true story of my sad adventures; judge for \
yourselves now whether the sighs and lamentations you heard, and the tears \
that flowed from my eyes, had not sufficient cause even if I had indulged in \
them more freely; and if you consider the nature of my misfortune you will \
see that consolation is idle, as there is no possible remedy for it. All I \
ask of you is, what you may easily and reasonably do, to show me where I may \
pass my life unharassed by the fear and dread of discovery by those who are \
in search of me; for though the great love my parents bear me makes me feel \
sure of being kindly received by them, so great is my feeling of shame at the \
mere thought that I cannot present myself before them as they expect, that I \
had rather banish myself from their sight for ever than look them in the face \
with the reflection that they beheld mine stripped of that purity they had a \
right to expect in me.\" With these words she became silent, and the colour \
that overspread her face showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering \
at heart. In theirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her \
misfortunes; but as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation \
and advice Cardenio forestalled him, saying, \"So then, senora, you are the \
fair Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?\" Dorothea was \
astonished at hearing her father's name, and at the miserable appearance of \
him who mentioned it, for it has been already said how wretchedly clad \
Cardenio was; so she said to him: \"And who may you be, brother, who seem to \
know my father's name so well? For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not \
mentioned it in the whole story of my misfortunes.\" \"I am that unhappy \
being, senora,\" replied Cardenio, \"whom, as you have said, Luscinda \
declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio, whom the \
wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present condition has reduced \
to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all human comfort, and \
what is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heaven is pleased for \
some short space to restore it to me. I, Dorothea, am he who witnessed the \
wrong done by Don Fernando, and waited to hear the 'Yes' uttered by which \
Luscinda owned herself his betrothed: I am he who had not courage enough to \
see how her fainting fit ended, or what came of the paper that was found in \
her bosom, because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokes \
of ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience I quitted the house, and \
leaving a letter with my host, which I entreated him to place in Luscinda's \
hands, I betook myself to these solitudes, resolved to end here the life I \
hated as if it were my mortal enemy. But fate would not rid me of it, \
contenting itself with robbing me of my reason, perhaps to preserve me for \
the good fortune I have had in meeting you; for if that which you have just \
told us be true, as I believe it to be, it may be that Heaven has yet in \
store for both of us a happier termination to our misfortunes than we look \
for; because seeing that Luscinda cannot marry Don Fernando, being mine, as \
she has herself so openly declared, and that Don Fernando cannot marry her as \
he is yours, we may reasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is \
ours, as it is still in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed. And as \
we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, \
I entreat you, senora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I mean \
to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for I \
swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you \
until I see you in possession of Don Fernando, and if I cannot by words \
induce him to recognise his obligation to you, in that case to avail myself \
of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause \
challenge him on account of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own \
wrongs, which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote \
myself to yours.\" Cardenio's words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, \
and not knowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss \
his feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for \
both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised, \
and urged them to come with him to his village, where they might furnish \
themselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover Don Fernando, \
or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to them most advisable. \
Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him, and accepted the kind offer he made them; \
and the barber, who had been listening to all attentively and in silence, on \
his part some kindly words also, and with no less good-will than the curate \
offered his services in any way that might be of use to them. He also \
explained to them in a few words the object that had brought them there, and \
the strange nature of Don Quixote's madness, and how they were waiting for \
his squire, who had gone in search of him. Like the recollection of a dream, \
the quarrel he had had with Don Quixote came back to Cardenio's memory, and \
he described it to the others; but he was unable to say what the dispute was \
about. At this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from \
Sancho Panza, who, not finding them where he had left them, was calling aloud \
to them. They went to meet him, and in answer to their inquiries about Don \
Quixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to his shirt, lank, \
yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his lady Dulcinea; and \
although he had told him that she commanded him to quit that place and come \
to El Toboso, where she was expecting him, he had answered that he was \
determined not to appear in the presence of her beauty until he had done \
deeds to make him worthy of her favour; and if this went on, Sancho said, he \
ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as in duty bound, or even an \
archbishop, which was the least he could be; for which reason they ought to \
consider what was to be done to get him away from there. The licentiate in \
reply told him not to be uneasy, for they would fetch him away in spite of \
himself. He then told Cardenio and Dorothea what they had proposed to do to \
cure Don Quixote, or at any rate take him home; upon which Dorothea said that \
she could play the distressed damsel better than the barber; especially as \
she had there the dress in which to do it to the life, and that they might \
trust to her acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying out \
their scheme, for she had read a great many books of chivalry, and knew \
exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of knights-errant. \
\"In that case,\" said the curate, \"there is nothing more required than to \
set about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself in our \
favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for your relief, \
and smoothed the way for us to our object.\" Dorothea then took out of her \
pillow-case a complete petticoat of some rich stuff, and a green mantle of \
some other fine material, and a necklace and other ornaments out of a little \
box, and with these in an instant she so arrayed herself that she looked like \
a great and rich lady. All this, and more, she said, she had taken from home \
in case of need, but that until then she had had no occasion to make use of \
it. They were all highly delighted with her grace, air, and beauty, and \
declared Don Fernando to be a man of very little taste when he rejected such \
charms. But the one who admired her most was Sancho Panza, for it seemed to \
him (what indeed was true) that in all the days of his life he had never seen \
such a lovely creature; and he asked the curate with great eagerness who this \
beautiful lady was, and what she wanted in these out-of-the-way quarters. \
\"This fair lady, brother Sancho,\" replied the curate, \"is no less a \
personage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom of \
Micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of him, which \
is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done her; and \
from the fame as a good knight which your master has acquired far and wide, \
this princess has come from Guinea to seek him.\" \"A lucky seeking and a \
lucky finding!\" said Sancho Panza at this; \"especially if my master has the \
good fortune to redress that injury, and right that wrong, and kill that son \
of a bitch of a giant your worship speaks of; as kill him he will if he meets \
him, unless, indeed, he happens to be a phantom; for my master has no power \
at all against phantoms. But one thing among others I would beg of you, senor \
licentiate, which is, that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an \
archbishop, for that is what I'm afraid of, your worship would recommend him \
to marry this princess at once; for in this way he will be disabled from \
taking archbishop's orders, and will easily come into his empire, and I to \
the end of my desires; I have been thinking over the matter carefully, and by \
what I can make out I find it will not do for me that my master should become \
an archbishop, because I am no good for the Church, as I am married; and for \
me now, having as I have a wife and children, to set about obtaining \
dispensations to enable me to hold a place of profit under the Church, would \
be endless work; so that, senor, it all turns on my master marrying this lady \
at once--for as yet I do not know her grace, and so I cannot call her by her \
name.\" \"She is called the Princess Micomicona,\" said the curate; \"for as \
her kingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her name.\" \"There's no \
doubt of that,\" replied Sancho, \"for I have known many to take their name \
and title from the place where they were born and call themselves Pedro of \
Alcala, Juan of Ubeda, and Diego of Valladolid; and it may be that over there \
in Guinea queens have the same way of taking the names of their kingdoms.\" \
\"So it may,\" said the curate; \"and as for your master's marrying, I will \
do all in my power towards it:\" with which Sancho was as much pleased as the \
curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a hold the absurdities \
of his master had taken of his fancy, for he had evidently persuaded himself \
that he was going to be an emperor. By this time Dorothea had seated herself \
upon the curate's mule, and the barber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his \
face, and they now told Sancho to conduct them to where Don Quixote was, \
warning him not to say that he knew either the licentiate or the barber, as \
his master's becoming an emperor entirely depended on his not recognising \
them; neither the curate nor Cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them; \
Cardenio lest he should remind Don Quixote of the quarrel he had with him, \
and the curate as there was no necessity for his presence just yet, so they \
allowed the others to go on before them, while they themselves followed \
slowly on foot. The curate did not forget to instruct Dorothea how to act, \
but she said they might make their minds easy, as everything would be done \
exactly as the books of chivalry required and described. They had gone about \
three-quarters of a league when they discovered Don Quixote in a wilderness \
of rocks, by this time clothed, but without his armour; and as soon as \
Dorothea saw him and was told by Sancho that that was Don Quixote, she \
whipped her palfrey, the well-bearded barber following her, and on coming up \
to him her squire sprang from his mule and came forward to receive her in his \
arms, and she dismounting with great ease of manner advanced to kneel before \
the feet of Don Quixote; and though he strove to raise her up, she without \
rising addressed him in this fashion: \"From this spot I will not rise, \
valiant and doughty knight, until your goodness and courtesy grant me a boon, \
which will redound to the honour and renown of your person and render a \
service to the most disconsolate and afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and \
if the might of your strong arm corresponds to the repute of your immortal \
fame, you are bound to aid the helpless being who, led by the savour of your \
renowned name, hath come from far distant lands to seek your aid in her \
misfortunes.\" \"I will not answer a word, beauteous lady,\" replied Don \
Quixote, \"nor will I listen to anything further concerning you, until you \
rise from the earth.\" \"I will not rise, senor,\" answered the afflicted \
damsel, \"unless of your courtesy the boon I ask is first granted me.\" \"I \
grant and accord it,\" said Don Quixote, \"provided without detriment or \
prejudice to my king, my country, or her who holds the key of my heart and \
freedom, it may be complied with.\" \"It will not be to the detriment or \
prejudice of any of them, my worthy lord,\" said the afflicted damsel; and \
here Sancho Panza drew close to his master's ear and said to him very softly, \
\"Your worship may very safely grant the boon she asks; it's nothing at all; \
only to kill a big giant; and she who asks it is the exalted Princess \
Micomicona, queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon of Ethiopia.\" \"Let her \
be who she may,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I will do what is my bounden duty, \
and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what I have professed;\" \
and turning to the damsel he said, \"Let your great beauty rise, for I grant \
the boon which you would ask of me.\" \"Then what I ask,\" said the damsel, \
\"is that your magnanimous person accompany me at once whither I will conduct \
you, and that you promise not to engage in any other adventure or quest until \
you have avenged me of a traitor who against all human and divine law, has \
usurped my kingdom.\" \"I repeat that I grant it,\" replied Don Quixote; \
\"and so, lady, you may from this day forth lay aside the melancholy that \
distresses you, and let your failing hopes gather new life and strength, for \
with the help of God and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to \
your kingdom, and seated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm, \
notwithstanding and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now hands \
to the work, for in delay there is apt to be danger.\" The distressed damsel \
strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands; but Don Quixote, who was in \
all things a polished and courteous knight, would by no means allow it, but \
made her rise and embraced her with great courtesy and politeness, and \
ordered Sancho to look to Rocinante's girths, and to arm him without a \
moment's delay. Sancho took down the armour, which was hung up on a tree like \
a trophy, and having seen to the girths armed his master in a trice, who as \
soon as he found himself in his armour exclaimed: \"Let us be gone in the \
name of God to bring aid to this great lady.\" The barber was all this time \
on his knees at great pains to hide his laughter and not let his beard fall, \
for had it fallen maybe their fine scheme would have come to nothing; but now \
seeing the boon granted, and the promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared \
to set out in compliance with it, he rose and took his lady's hand, and \
between them they placed her upon the mule. Don Quixote then mounted \
Rocinante, and the barber settled himself on his beast, Sancho being left to \
go on foot, which made him feel anew the loss of his Dapple, finding the want \
of him now. But he bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his \
master had now fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an \
emperor; for he felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess, and \
be king of Micomicon at least. The only thing that troubled him was the \
reflection that this kingdom was in the land of the blacks, and that the \
people they would give him for vassals would be all black; but for this he \
soon found a remedy in his fancy, and said he to himself, \"What is it to me \
if my vassals are blacks? What more have I to do than make a cargo of them \
and carry them to Spain, where I can sell them and get ready money for them, \
and with it buy some title or some office in which to live at ease all the \
days of my life? Not unless you go to sleep and haven't the wit or skill to \
turn things to account and sell three, six, or ten thousand vassals while you \
would be talking about it! By God I will stir them up, big and little, or as \
best I can, and let them be ever so black I'll turn them into white or \
yellow. Come, come, what a fool I am!\" And so he jogged on, so occupied with \
his thoughts and easy in his mind that he forgot all about the hardship of \
travelling on foot. Cardenio and the curate were watching all this from among \
some bushes, not knowing how to join company with the others; but the curate, \
who was very fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting their \
purpose, and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut off \
Cardenio's beard, and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he gave him a \
black cloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet, while Cardenio's \
appearance was so different from what it had been that he would not have \
known himself had he seen himself in a mirror. Having effected this, although \
the others had gone on ahead while they were disguising themselves, they \
easily came out on the high road before them, for the brambles and awkward \
places they encountered did not allow those on horseback to go as fast as \
those on foot. They then posted themselves on the level ground at the outlet \
of the Sierra, and as soon as Don Quixote and his companions emerged from it \
the curate began to examine him very deliberately, as though he were striving \
to recognise him, and after having stared at him for some time he hastened \
towards him with open arms exclaiming, \"A happy meeting with the mirror of \
chivalry, my worthy compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flower and cream \
of high breeding, the protection and relief of the distressed, the \
quintessence of knights-errant!\" And so saying he clasped in his arms the \
knee of Don Quixote's left leg. He, astonished at the stranger's words and \
behaviour, looked at him attentively, and at length recognised him, very much \
surprised to see him there, and made great efforts to dismount. This, \
however, the curate would not allow, on which Don Quixote said, \"Permit me, \
senor licentiate, for it is not fitting that I should be on horseback and so \
reverend a person as your worship on foot.\" \"On no account will I allow it,\
\" said the curate; \"your mightiness must remain on horseback, for it is on \
horseback you achieve the greatest deeds and adventures that have been beheld \
in our age; as for me, an unworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to \
mount on the haunches of one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany \
your worship, if they have no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the \
steed Pegasus, or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor, \
Muzaraque, who to this day lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema, a \
little distance from the great Complutum.\" \"Nor even that will I consent \
to, senor licentiate,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and I know it will be the \
good pleasure of my lady the princess, out of love for me, to order her \
squire to give up the saddle of his mule to your worship, and he can sit \
behind if the beast will bear it.\" \"It will, I am sure,\" said the \
princess, \"and I am sure, too, that I need not order my squire, for he is \
too courteous and considerate to allow a Churchman to go on foot when he \
might be mounted.\" \"That he is,\" said the barber, and at once alighting, \
he offered his saddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; \
but unfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it \
happened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying ill-conditioned, \
lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in the air, which would \
have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition in quest of Don Quixote at the \
devil had they caught him on the breast or head. As it was, they so took him \
by surprise that he came to the ground, giving so little heed to his beard \
that it fell off, and all he could do when he found himself without it was to \
cover his face hastily with both his hands and moan that his teeth were \
knocked out. Don Quixote when he saw all that bundle of beard detached, \
without jaws or blood, from the face of the fallen squire, exclaimed: \"By \
the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and plucked \
away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off designedly.\" The \
curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme, at once \
pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where Master Nicholas lay, \
still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast had it on in an \
instant, muttering over him some words which he said were a certain special \
charm for sticking on beards, as they would see; and as soon as he had it \
fixed he left him, and the squire appeared well bearded and whole as before, \
whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure astonished, and begged the curate to \
teach him that charm when he had an opportunity, as he was persuaded its \
virtue must extend beyond the sticking on of beards, for it was clear that \
where the beard had been stripped off the flesh must have remained torn and \
lacerated, and when it could heal all that it must be good for more than \
beards. \"And so it is,\" said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him \
on the first opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curate \
should mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they reached the \
inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were. Three then being \
mounted, that is to say, Don Quixote, the princess, and the curate, and three \
on foot, Cardenio, the barber, and Sancho Panza, Don Quixote said to the \
damsel: \"Let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to \
you;\" but before she could answer the licentiate said: \"Towards what \
kingdom would your ladyship direct our course? Is it perchance towards that \
of Micomicon? It must be, or else I know little about kingdoms.\" She, being \
ready on all points, understood that she was to answer \"Yes,\" so she said \
\"Yes, senor, my way lies towards that kingdom.\" \"In that case,\" said the \
curate, \"we must pass right through my village, and there your worship will \
take the road to Cartagena, where you will be able to embark, fortune \
favouring; and if the wind be fair and the sea smooth and tranquil, in \
somewhat less than nine years you may come in sight of the great lake Meona, \
I mean Meotides, which is little more than a hundred days' journey this side \
of your highness's kingdom.\" \"Your worship is mistaken, senor,\" said she; \
\"for it is not two years since I set out from it, and though I never had \
good weather, nevertheless I am here to behold what I so longed for, and that \
is my lord Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose fame came to my ears as soon as I \
set foot in Spain and impelled me to go in search of him, to commend myself \
to his courtesy, and entrust the justice of my cause to the might of his \
invincible arm.\" \"Enough; no more praise,\" said Don Quixote at this, \"for \
I hate all flattery; and though this may not be so, still language of the \
kind is offensive to my chaste ears. I will only say, senora, that whether it \
has might or not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to your \
service even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season, I would \
ask the senor licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought him into \
these parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I am filled with \
amazement.\" \"I will answer that briefly,\" replied the curate; \"you must \
know then, Senor Don Quixote, that Master Nicholas, our friend and barber, \
and I were going to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who \
went to the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum but \
that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, which is \
something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by four \
footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they stripped off so \
that the barber found it necessary to put on a false one, and even this young \
man here\"-pointing to Cardenio--\"they completely transformed. But the best \
of it is, the story goes in the neighbourhood that those who attacked us \
belong to a number of galley slaves who, they say, were set free almost on \
the very same spot by a man of such valour that, in spite of the commissary \
and of the guards, he released the whole of them; and beyond all doubt he \
must have been out of his senses, or he must be as great a scoundrel as they, \
or some man without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the \
sheep, the fox among the hens, the fly among the honey. He has defrauded \
justice, and opposed his king and lawful master, for he opposed his just \
commands; he has, I say, robbed the galleys of their feet, stirred up the \
Holy Brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet, and, lastly, has \
done a deed by which his soul may be lost without any gain to his body.\" \
Sancho had told the curate and the barber of the adventure of the galley \
slaves, which, so much to his glory, his master had achieved, and hence the \
curate in alluding to it made the most of it to see what would be said or \
done by Don Quixote; who changed colour at every word, not daring to say that \
it was he who had been the liberator of those worthy people. \"These, then,\" \
said the curate, \"were they who robbed us; and God in his mercy pardon him \
who would not let them go to the punishment they deserved.\" CHAPTER XXX. \
WHICH TREATS OF ADDRESS DISPLAYED BY THE FAIR DOROTHEA, WITH OTHER MATTERS \
PLEASANT AND AMUSING The curate had hardly ceased speaking, when Sancho said, \
\"In faith, then, senor licentiate, he who did that deed was my master; and \
it was not for want of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what \
he was about, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as they were all \
on the march there because they were special scoundrels.\" \"Blockhead!\" \
said Don Quixote at this, \"it is no business or concern of knights-errant to \
inquire whether any persons in affliction, in chains, or oppressed that they \
may meet on the high roads go that way and suffer as they do because of their \
faults or because of their misfortunes. It only concerns them to aid them as \
persons in need of help, having regard to their sufferings and not to their \
rascalities. I encountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate \
people, and did for them what my sense of duty demands of me, and as for the \
rest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it, saving the sacred \
dignity of the senor licentiate and his honoured person, I say he knows \
little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain, and this I will give \
him to know to the fullest extent with my sword;\" and so saying he settled \
himself in his stirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber's basin, \
which according to him was Mambrino's helmet, he carried hanging at the \
saddle-bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley slaves. \
Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly \
understood Don Quixote's crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza were \
making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on observing his \
irritation, \"Sir Knight, remember the boon you have promised me, and that in \
accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure, be it ever so \
pressing; calm yourself, for if the licentiate had known that the galley \
slaves had been set free by that unconquered arm he would have stopped his \
mouth thrice over, or even bitten his tongue three times before he would have \
said a word that tended towards disrespect of your worship.\" \"That I swear \
heartily,\" said the curate, \"and I would have even plucked off a moustache.\
\" \"I will hold my peace, senora,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I will curb the \
natural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace and \
quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this \
consideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do so, \
what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are the \
persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am to take \
vengeance on your behalf?\" \"That I will do with all my heart,\" replied \
Dorothea, \"if it will not be wearisome to you to hear of miseries and \
misfortunes.\" \"It will not be wearisome, senora,\" said Don Quixote; to \
which Dorothea has just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is \
the mark of a strong man.\" \"That is enough,\" said Dorothea, \"for with \
friends we must not look too closely into trifles; and whether it be on the \
shoulder or on the backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, \
be it where it may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit \
the truth in every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending \
myself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the features \
of his countenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide \
fame he has acquired not only in Spain but in all La Mancha; for I had \
scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such accounts of his achievements, that \
at once my heart told me he was the very one I had come in search of.\" \"But \
how did you land at Osuna, senora,\" asked Don Quixote, \"when it is not a \
seaport?\" But before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, \
saying, \"The princess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the \
first place where she heard of your worship was Osuna.\" \"That is what I \
meant to say,\" said Dorothea. \"And that would be only natural,\" said the \
curate. \"Will your majesty please proceed?\" \"There is no more to add,\" \
said Dorothea, \"save that in finding Don Quixote I have had such good \
fortune, that I already reckon and regard myself queen and mistress of my \
entire dominions, since of his courtesy and magnanimity he has granted me the \
boon of accompanying me whithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only \
to bring him face to face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay \
him and restore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this \
must come to pass satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient \
foretold it, who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or Greek \
characters (for I cannot read them), that if this predicted knight, after \
having cut the giant's throat, should be disposed to marry me I was to offer \
myself at once without demur as his lawful wife, and yield him possession of \
my kingdom together with my person.\" \"What thinkest thou now, friend \
Sancho?\" said Don Quixote at this. \"Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee \
so? See how we have already got a kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!\" \
\"On my oath it is so,\" said Sancho; \"and foul fortune to him who won't \
marry after slitting Senor Pandahilado's windpipe! And then, how ill-favoured \
the queen is! I wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!\" And so saying he \
cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of extreme satisfaction, \
and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea's mule, and checking it fell on \
his knees before her, begging her to give him her hand to kiss in token of \
his acknowledgment of her as his queen and mistress. Which of the bystanders \
could have helped laughing to see the madness of the master and the \
simplicity of the servant? Dorothea therefore gave her hand, and promised to \
make him a great lord in her kingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to \
permit her to recover and enjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words \
that set them all laughing again. \"This, sirs,\" continued Dorothea, \"is my \
story; it only remains to tell you that of all the attendants I took with me \
from my kingdom I have none left except this well-bearded squire, for all \
were drowned in a great tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he \
and I came to land on a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the \
whole course of my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed; \
and if I have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as I ought, \
let it be accounted for by what the licentiate said at the beginning of my \
tale, that constant and excessive troubles deprive the sufferers of their \
memory.\" \"They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,\" \
said Don Quixote, \"however great and unexampled those which I shall endure \
in your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have promised you, \
and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until I find myself in the \
presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head I trust by the aid of my \
arm to cut off with the edge of this--I will not say good sword, thanks to \
Gines de Pasamonte who carried away mine\"--(this he said between his teeth, \
and then continued), \"and when it has been cut off and you have been put in \
peaceful possession of your realm it shall be left to your own decision to \
dispose of your person as may be most pleasing to you; for so long as my \
memory is occupied, my will enslaved, and my understanding enthralled by \
her-I say no more--it is impossible for me for a moment to contemplate \
marriage, even with a Phoenix.\" The last words of his master about not \
wanting to marry were so disagreeable to Sancho that raising his voice he \
exclaimed with great irritation: \"By my oath, Senor Don Quixote, you are not \
in your right senses; for how can your worship possibly object to marrying \
such an exalted princess as this? Do you think Fortune will offer you behind \
every stone such a piece of luck as is offered you now? Is my lady Dulcinea \
fairer, perchance? Not she; nor half as fair; and I will even go so far as to \
say she does not come up to the shoe of this one here. A poor chance I have \
of getting that county I am waiting for if your worship goes looking for \
dainties in the bottom of the sea. In the devil's name, marry, marry, and \
take this kingdom that comes to hand without any trouble, and when you are \
king make me a marquis or governor of a province, and for the rest let the \
devil take it all.\" Don Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered \
against his lady Dulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without \
saying anything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks \
that he brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea cried \
out to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on the spot. \
\"Do you think,\" he said to him after a pause, \"you scurvy clown, that you \
are to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be always offending \
and I always pardoning? Don't fancy it, impious scoundrel, for that beyond a \
doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going against the peerless \
Dulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar, that were it not for the \
might that she infuses into my arm I should not have strength enough to kill \
a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper's tongue, what think you has won this \
kingdom and cut off this giant's head and made you a marquis (for all this I \
count as already accomplished and decided), but the might of Dulcinea, \
employing my arm as the instrument of her achievements? She fights in me and \
conquers in me, and I live and breathe in her, and owe my life and being to \
her. O whoreson scoundrel, how ungrateful you are, you see yourself raised \
from the dust of the earth to be a titled lord, and the return you make for \
so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who has conferred it upon you!\" \
Sancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said, and rising \
with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behind Dorothea's \
palfrey, and from that position he said to his master: \"Tell me, senor; if \
your worship is resolved not to marry this great princess, it is plain the \
kingdom will not be yours; and not being so, how can you bestow favours upon \
me? That is what I complain of. Let your worship at any rate marry this \
queen, now that we have got her here as if showered down from heaven, and \
afterwards you may go back to my lady Dulcinea; for there must have been \
kings in the world who kept mistresses. As to beauty, I have nothing to do \
with it; and if the truth is to be told, I like them both; though I have \
never seen the lady Dulcinea.\" \"How! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!\" \
exclaimed Don Quixote; \"hast thou not just now brought me a message from \
her?\" \"I mean,\" said Sancho, \"that I did not see her so much at my \
leisure that I could take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charms \
piecemeal; but taken in the lump I like her.\" \"Now I forgive thee,\" said \
Don Quixote; \"and do thou forgive me the injury I have done thee; for our \
first impulses are not in our control.\" \"That I see,\" replied Sancho, \
\"and with me the wish to speak is always the first impulse, and I cannot \
help saying, once at any rate, what I have on the tip of my tongue.\" \"For \
all that, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"take heed of what thou sayest, for \
the pitcher goes so often to the well--I need say no more to thee.\" \"Well, \
well,\" said Sancho, \"God is in heaven, and sees all tricks, and will judge \
who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or your worship in not doing it.\
\" \"That is enough,\" said Dorothea; \"run, Sancho, and kiss your lord's \
hand and beg his pardon, and henceforward be more circumspect with your \
praise and abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that lady Toboso, of \
whom I know nothing save that I am her servant; and put your trust in God, \
for you will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince.\" \
Sancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master's hand, which Don \
Quixote with dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing as soon as he \
had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as he had questions to \
ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him. Sancho obeyed, \
and when the two had gone some distance in advance Don Quixote said to him, \
\"Since thy return I have had no opportunity or time to ask thee many \
particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou hast brought back, and \
now that chance has granted us the time and opportunity, deny me not the \
happiness thou canst give me by such good news.\" \"Let your worship ask what \
you will,\" answered Sancho, \"for I shall find a way out of all as as I \
found a way in; but I implore you, senor, not not to be so revengeful in \
future.\" \"Why dost thou say that, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote. \"I say it,\" \
he returned, \"because those blows just now were more because of the quarrel \
the devil stirred up between us both the other night, than for what I said \
against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love and reverence as I would a \
relic--though there is nothing of that about her--merely as something \
belonging to your worship.\" \"Say no more on that subject for thy life, \
Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for it is displeasing to me; I have already \
pardoned thee for that, and thou knowest the common saying, 'for a fresh sin \
a fresh penance.'\" While this was going on they saw coming along the road \
they were following a man mounted on an ass, who when he came close seemed to \
be a gipsy; but Sancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever he saw \
asses, no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be Gines de Pasamonte; \
and by the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball, his ass, for it was, in \
fact, Dapple that carried Pasamonte, who to escape recognition and to sell \
the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being able to speak the gipsy \
language, and many more, as well as if they were his own. Sancho saw him and \
recognised him, and the instant he did so he shouted to him, \"Ginesillo, you \
thief, give up my treasure, release my life, embarrass thyself not with my \
repose, quit my ass, leave my delight, be off, rip, get thee gone, thief, and \
give up what is not thine.\" There was no necessity for so many words or \
objurgations, for at the first one Gines jumped down, and at a like racing \
speed made off and got clear of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and \
embracing him he said, \"How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, \
my comrade?\" all the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a \
human being. The ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and caressed \
by Sancho without answering a single word. They all came up and congratulated \
him on having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially, who told him that \
notwithstanding this he would not cancel the order for the three ass-colts, \
for which Sancho thanked him. While the two had been going along conversing \
in this fashion, the curate observed to Dorothea that she had shown great \
cleverness, as well in the story itself as in its conciseness, and the \
resemblance it bore to those of the books of chivalry. She said that she had \
many times amused herself reading them; but that she did not know the \
situation of the provinces or seaports, and so she had said at haphazard that \
she had landed at Osuna. \"So I saw,\" said the curate, \"and for that reason \
I made haste to say what I did, by which it was all set right. But is it not \
a strange thing to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these \
figments and lies, simply because they are in the style and manner of the \
absurdities of his books?\" \"So it is,\" said Cardenio; \"and so uncommon \
and unexampled, that were one to attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction, \
I doubt if there be any wit keen enough to imagine it.\" \"But another \
strange thing about it,\" said the curate, \"is that, apart from the silly \
things which this worthy gentleman says in connection with his craze, when \
other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them in a perfectly rational \
manner, showing that his mind is quite clear and composed; so that, provided \
his chivalry is not touched upon, no one would take him to be anything but a \
man of thoroughly sound understanding.\" While they were holding this \
conversation Don Quixote continued his with Sancho, saying: \"Friend Panza, \
let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell me now, dismissing \
anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst thou find Dulcinea? What was \
she doing? What didst thou say to her? What did she answer? How did she look \
when she was reading my letter? Who copied it out for thee? and everything in \
the matter that seems to thee worth knowing, asking, and learning; neither \
adding nor falsifying to give me pleasure, nor yet curtailing lest you should \
deprive me of it.\" \"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"if the truth is to be told, \
nobody copied out the letter for me, for I carried no letter at all.\" \"It \
is as thou sayest,\" said Don Quixote, \"for the note-book in which I wrote \
it I found in my own possession two days after thy departure, which gave me \
very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst do on finding thyself \
without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst return from the place where \
thou didst first miss it.\" \"So I should have done,\" said Sancho, \"if I \
had not got it by heart when your worship read it to me, so that I repeated \
it to a sacristan, who copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that \
he said in all the days of his life, though he had read many a letter of \
excommunication, he had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that.\" \
\"And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote. \"No, \
senor,\" replied Sancho, \"for as soon as I had repeated it, seeing there was \
no further use for it, I set about forgetting it; and if I recollect any of \
it, it is that about 'Scrubbing,'I mean to say 'Sovereign Lady,' and the end \
'Yours till death, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance;' and between these \
two I put into it more than three hundred 'my souls' and 'my life's' and 'my \
eyes.\" CHAPTER XXXI. OF THE DELECTABLE DISCUSSION BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND \
SANCHO PANZA, HIS SQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS \"All that is not \
unsatisfactory to me,\" said Don Quixote. \"Go on; thou didst reach her; and \
what was that queen of beauty doing? Surely thou didst find her stringing \
pearls, or embroidering some device in gold thread for this her enslaved \
knight.\" \"I did not,\" said Sancho, \"but I found her winnowing two bushels \
of wheat in the yard of her house.\" \"Then depend upon it,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"the grains of that wheat were pearls when touched by her hands; \
and didst thou look, friend? was it white wheat or brown?\" \"It was neither, \
but red,\" said Sancho. \"Then I promise thee,\" said Don Quixote, \"that, \
winnowed by her hands, beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; \
but go on; when thou gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it \
on her head? Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?\" \
\"When I went to give it to her,\" replied Sancho, \"she was hard at it \
swaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, and she \
said to me, 'Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for I cannot \
read it until I have done sifting all this.\" \"Discreet lady!\" said Don \
Quixote; \"that was in order to read it at her leisure and enjoy it; proceed, \
Sancho; while she was engaged in her occupation what converse did she hold \
with thee? What did she ask about me, and what answer didst thou give? Make \
haste; tell me all, and let not an atom be left behind in the ink-bottle.\" \
\"She asked me nothing,\" said Sancho; \"but I told her how your worship was \
left doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in among these \
mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eating bread off a \
tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your fortune.\" \"In \
saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,\" said Don Quixote; \"for \
rather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life for having \
made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as Dulcinea del Toboso.\" \
\"And so lofty she is,\" said Sancho, \"that she overtops me by more than a \
hand's-breadth.\" \"What! Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"didst thou measure \
with her?\" \"I measured in this way,\" said Sancho; \"going to help her to \
put a sack of wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I \
could see she stood more than a good palm over me.\" \"Well!\" said Don \
Quixote, \"and doth she not of a truth accompany and adorn this greatness \
with a thousand million charms of mind! But one thing thou wilt not deny, \
Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst thou not perceive a Sabaean \
odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not what, delicious, that I cannot \
find a name for; I mean a redolence, an exhalation, as if thou wert in the \
shop of some dainty glover?\" \"All I can say is,\" said Sancho, \"that I did \
perceive a little odour, something goaty; it must have been that she was all \
in a sweat with hard work.\" \"It could not be that,\" said Don Quixote, \
\"but thou must have been suffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt \
thyself; for I know well what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, \
that lily of the field, that dissolved amber.\" \"Maybe so,\" replied Sancho; \
\"there often comes from myself that same odour which then seemed to me to \
come from her grace the lady Dulcinea; but that's no wonder, for one devil is \
like another.\" \"Well then,\" continued Don Quixote, \"now she has done \
sifting the corn and sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the \
letter?\" \"As for the letter,\" said Sancho, \"she did not read it, for she \
said she could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into \
small pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest her \
secrets should become known in the village, and that what I had told her by \
word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and the extraordinary \
penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to make an end of it, \
she told me to tell your worship that she kissed your hands, and that she had \
a greater desire to see you than to write to you; and that therefore she \
entreated and commanded you, on sight of this present, to come out of these \
thickets, and to have done with carrying on absurdities, and to set out at \
once for El Toboso, unless something else of greater importance should \
happen, for she had a great desire to see your worship. She laughed greatly \
when I told her how your worship was called The Knight of the Rueful \
Countenance; I asked her if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and \
she told me he had, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about \
the galley slaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet.\" \"So far all \
goes well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but tell me what jewel was it that she gave \
thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of me? For it is a usual \
and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to give the squires, \
damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to the knights, or of \
their knights to the ladies, some rich jewel as a guerdon for good news,' and \
acknowledgment of the message.\" \"That is very likely,\" said Sancho, \"and \
a good custom it was, to my mind; but that must have been in days gone by, \
for now it would seem to be the custom only to give a piece of bread and \
cheese; because that was what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the \
yard-wall when I took leave of her; and more by token it was sheep's-milk \
cheese.\" \"She is generous in the extreme,\" said Don Quixote, \"and if she \
did not give thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had \
not one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter; I \
shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what amazes me, \
Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air, for thou \
hast taken but little more than three days to go to El Toboso and return, \
though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there. From which I am \
inclined to think that the sage magician who is my friend, and watches over \
my interests (for of necessity there is and must be one, or else I should not \
be a right knight-errant), that this same, I say, must have helped thee to \
travel without thy knowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a \
knight-errant sleeping in his bed, and without his knowing how or in what way \
it happened, he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away from \
the place where he went to sleep. And if it were not for this, knights-errant \
would not be able to give aid to one another in peril, as they do at every \
turn. For a knight, maybe, is fighting in the mountains of Armenia with some \
dragon, or fierce serpent, or another knight, and gets the worst of the \
battle, and is at the point of death; but when he least looks for it, there \
appears over against him on a cloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a \
friend of his, who just before had been in England, and who takes his part, \
and delivers him from death; and at night he finds himself in his own \
quarters supping very much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the \
other will have been two or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by \
the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant \
knights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that thou \
mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such a short \
time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have carried thee \
through the air without thee perceiving it.\" \"That must have been it,\" \
said Sancho, \"for indeed Rocinante went like a gipsy's ass with quicksilver \
in his ears.\" \"Quicksilver!\" said Don Quixote, \"aye and what is more, a \
legion of devils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being \
weary, exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what thinkest \
thou I ought to do about my lady's command to go and see her? For though I \
feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that I am debarred by \
the boon I have accorded to the princess that accompanies us, and the law of \
chivalry compels me to have regard for my word in preference to my \
inclination; on the one hand the desire to see my lady pursues and harasses \
me, on the other my solemn promise and the glory I shall win in this \
enterprise urge and call me; but what I think I shall do is to travel with \
all speed and reach quickly the place where this giant is, and on my arrival \
I shall cut off his head, and establish the princess peacefully in her realm, \
and forthwith I shall return to behold the light that lightens my senses, to \
whom I shall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay, \
for she will see that it entirely tends to increase her glory and fame; for \
all that I have won, am winning, or shall win by arms in this life, comes to \
me of the favour she extends to me, and because I am hers.\" \"Ah! what a sad \
state your worship's brains are in!\" said Sancho. \"Tell me, senor, do you \
mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let slip and lose so rich and \
great a match as this where they give as a portion a kingdom that in sober \
truth I have heard say is more than twenty thousand leagues round about, and \
abounds with all things necessary to support human life, and is bigger than \
Portugal and Castile put together? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what \
you have said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the \
first village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate who \
will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give advice, \
and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in the hand is \
better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good to his hand and \
chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not come to him.\" \"Look \
here, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote. \"If thou art advising me to marry, in \
order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become king, and be able to \
confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have promised, let me tell thee \
I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without marrying; for \
before going into battle I will make it a stipulation that, if I come out of \
it victorious, even I do not marry, they shall give me a portion portion of \
the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon whomsoever I choose, and when they \
give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow it but upon thee?\" \
\"That is plain speaking,\" said Sancho; \"but let your worship take care to \
choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don't like the life, I may be able to \
ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said; don't mind going \
to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant and let us finish off \
this business; for by God it strikes me it will be one of great honour and \
great profit.\" \"I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"and I will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before \
going to see Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to any one, or \
to those who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for as \
Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known it is \
not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.\" \"Well then, if \
that be so,\" said Sancho, \"how is it that your worship makes all those you \
overcome by your arm go to present themselves before my lady Dulcinea, this \
being the same thing as signing your name to it that you love her and are her \
lover? And as those who go must perforce kneel before her and say they come \
from your worship to submit themselves to her, how can the thoughts of both \
of you be hid?\" \"O, how silly and simple thou art!\" said Don Quixote; \
\"seest thou not, Sancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? For thou \
must know that according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high \
honour to a lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts \
never go beyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no other \
reward for their great and true devotion than that she should be willing to \
accept them as her knights.\" \"It is with that kind of love,\" said Sancho, \
\"I have heard preachers say we ought to love our Lord, for himself alone, \
without being moved by the hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though \
for my part, I would rather love and serve him for what he could do.\" \"The \
devil take thee for a clown!\" said Don Quixote, \"and what shrewd things \
thou sayest at times! One would think thou hadst studied.\" \"In faith, then, \
I cannot even read.\" Master Nicholas here called out to them to wait a \
while, as they wanted to halt and drink at a little spring there was there. \
Don Quixote drew up, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was \
by this time weary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master \
catching him tripping, for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of \
El Toboso, he had never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on the \
clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though they were \
not very good, they were far better than those he put off. They dismounted \
together by the side of the spring, and with what the curate had provided \
himself with at the inn they appeased, though not very well, the keen \
appetite they all of them brought with them. While they were so employed \
there happened to come by a youth passing on his way, who stopping to examine \
the party at the spring, the next moment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him \
round the legs, began to weep freely, saying, \"O, senor, do you not know me? \
Look at me well; I am that lad Andres that your worship released from the \
oak-tree where I was tied.\" Don Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand \
he turned to those present and said: \"That your worships may see how \
important it is to have knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries \
done by tyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some \
days ago passing through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of a \
person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my bounden \
duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed, \
and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you, which in my \
heart I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit me to depart from the \
truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to an oak, naked from the waist \
up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found to be his master, was scarifying him \
by lashes with the reins of his mare. As soon as I saw him I asked the reason \
of so cruel a flagellation. The boor replied that he was flogging him because \
he was his servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from \
dishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, 'Senor, he flogs me only \
because I ask for my wages.' The master made I know not what speeches and \
explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did not accept. In short, I \
compelled the clown to unbind him, and to swear he would take him with him, \
and pay him real by real, and perfumed into the bargain. Is not all this \
true, Andres my son? Didst thou not mark with what authority I commanded him, \
and with what humility he promised to do all I enjoined, specified, and \
required of him? Answer without hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took \
place, that they may see that it is as great an advantage as I say to have \
knights-errant abroad.\" \"All that your worship has said is quite true,\" \
answered the lad; \"but the end of the business turned out just the opposite \
of what your worship supposes.\" \"How! the opposite?\" said Don Quixote; \
\"did not the clown pay thee then?\" \"Not only did he not pay me,\" replied \
the lad, \"but as soon as your worship had passed out of the wood and we were \
alone, he tied me up again to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that \
left me like a flayed Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he \
followed up with some jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, \
and but for the pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he \
said. In short he left me in such a condition that I have been until now in a \
hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally clown inflicted on \
me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for if you had gone your own \
way and not come where there was no call for you, nor meddled in other \
people's affairs, my master would have been content with giving me one or two \
dozen lashes, and would have then loosed me and paid me what he owed me; but \
when your worship abused him so out of measure, and gave him so many hard \
words, his anger was kindled; and as he could not revenge himself on you, as \
soon as he saw you had left him the storm burst upon me in such a way, that I \
feel as if I should never be a man again.\" \"The mischief,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"lay in my going away; for I should not have gone until I had seen \
thee paid; because I ought to have known well by long experience that there \
is no clown who will keep his word if he finds it will not suit him to keep \
it; but thou rememberest, Andres, that I swore if he did not pay thee I would \
go and seek him, and find him though he were to hide himself in the whale's \
belly.\" \"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but it was of no use.\" \"Thou \
shalt see now whether it is of use or not,\" said Don Quixote; and so saying, \
he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who was browsing while \
they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant to do. He replied that he \
meant to go in search of this clown and chastise him for such iniquitous \
conduct, and see Andres paid to the last maravedi, despite and in the teeth \
of all the clowns in the world. To which she replied that he must remember \
that in accordance with his promise he could not engage in any enterprise \
until he had concluded hers; and that as he knew this better than anyone, he \
should restrain his ardour until his return from her kingdom. \"That is true,\
\" said Don Quixote, \"and Andres must have patience until my return as you \
say, senora; but I once more swear and promise not to stop until I have seen \
him avenged and paid.\" \"I have no faith in those oaths,\" said Andres; \"I \
would rather have now something to help me to get to Seville than all the \
revenges in the world; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with \
me, give it me, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may \
their errands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me.\" Sancho \
took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese, and giving \
them to the lad he said, \"Here, take this, brother Andres, for we have all \
of us a share in your misfortune.\" \"Why, what share have you got?\" \"This \
share of bread and cheese I am giving you,\" answered Sancho; \"and God knows \
whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for I would have you know, \
friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to bear a great deal of hunger \
and hard fortune, and even other things more easily felt than told.\" Andres \
seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him anything more, \
bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying is. However, before \
leaving he said, \"For the love of God, sir knight-errant, if you ever meet \
me again, though you may see them cutting me to pieces, give me no aid or \
succour, but leave me to my misfortune, which will not be so great but that a \
greater will come to me by being helped by your worship, on whom and all the \
knights-errant that have ever been born God send his curse.\" Don Quixote was \
getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at such a pace that no \
one attempted to follow him; and mightily chapfallen was Don Quixote at \
Andres' story, and the others had to take great care to restrain their \
laughter so as not to put him entirely out of countenance. CHAPTER XXXII. \
WHICH TREATS OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE'S PARTY AT THE INN Their dainty \
repast being finished, they saddled at once, and without any adventure worth \
mentioning they reached next day the inn, the object of Sancho Panza's fear \
and dread; but though he would have rather not entered it, there was no help \
for it. The landlady, the landlord, their daughter, and Maritornes, when they \
saw Don Quixote and Sancho coming, went out to welcome them with signs of \
hearty satisfaction, which Don Quixote received with dignity and gravity, and \
bade them make up a better bed for him than the last time: to which the \
landlady replied that if he paid better than he did the last time she would \
give him one fit for a prince. Don Quixote said he would, so they made up a \
tolerable one for him in the same garret as before; and he lay down at once, \
being sorely shaken and in want of sleep. No sooner was the door shut upon \
him than the landlady made at the barber, and seizing him by the beard, said: \
\"By my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer; you \
must give me back tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of my husband's \
goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I used to stick in my \
good tail.\" But for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up \
until the licentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further \
occasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and appear in \
his own character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to this inn when \
those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should he ask for the \
princess's squire, they could tell him that she had sent him on before her to \
give notice to the people of her kingdom that she was coming, and bringing \
with her the deliverer of them all. On this the barber cheerfully restored \
the tail to the landlady, and at the same time they returned all the \
accessories they had borrowed to effect Don Quixote's deliverance. All the \
people of the inn were struck with astonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, \
and even at the comely figure of the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them \
get ready such fare as there was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of \
better payment, served them up a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don \
Quixote was asleep, and they thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping \
would now do him more good than eating. While at dinner, the company \
consisting of the landlord, his wife, their daughter, Maritornes, and all the \
travellers, they discussed the strange craze of Don Quixote and the manner in \
which he had been found; and the landlady told them what had taken place \
between him and the carrier; and then, looking round to see if Sancho was \
there, when she saw he was not, she gave them the whole story of his \
blanketing, which they received with no little amusement. But on the curate \
observing that it was the books of chivalry which Don Quixote had read that \
had turned his brain, the landlord said: \"I cannot understand how that can \
be, for in truth to my mind there is no better reading in the world, and I \
have here two or three of them, with other writings that are the very life, \
not only of myself but of plenty more; for when it is harvest-time, the \
reapers flock here on holidays, and there is always one among them who can \
read and who takes up one of these books, and we gather round him, thirty or \
more of us, and stay listening to him with a delight that makes our grey \
hairs grow young again. At least I can say for myself that when I hear of \
what furious and terrible blows the knights deliver, I am seized with the \
longing to do the same, and I would like to be hearing about them night and \
day.\" \"And I just as much,\" said the landlady, \"because I never have a \
quiet moment in my house except when you are listening to some one reading; \
for then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to scold.\" \
\"That is true,\" said Maritornes; \"and, faith, I relish hearing these \
things greatly too, for they are very pretty; especially when they describe \
some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the orange trees, and \
the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead with envy and fright; all \
this I say is as good as honey.\" \"And you, what do you think, young lady?\" \
said the curate turning to the landlord's daughter. \"I don't know indeed, \
senor,\" said she; \"I listen too, and to tell the truth, though I do not \
understand it, I like hearing it; but it is not the blows that my father \
likes that I like, but the laments the knights utter when they are separated \
from their ladies; and indeed they sometimes make me weep with the pity I \
feel for them.\" \"Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, \
young lady?\" said Dorothea. \"I don't know what I should do,\" said the \
girl; \"I only know that there are some of those ladies so cruel that they \
call their knights tigers and lions and a thousand other foul names: and \
Jesus! I don't know what sort of folk they can be, so unfeeling and \
heartless, that rather than bestow a glance upon a worthy man they leave him \
to die or go mad. I don't know what is the good of such prudery; if it is for \
honour's sake, why not marry them? That's all they want.\" \"Hush, child,\" \
said the landlady; \"it seems to me thou knowest a great deal about these \
things, and it is not fit for girls to know or talk so much.\" \"As the \
gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,\" said the girl. \"Well \
then,\" said the curate, \"bring me these books, senor landlord, for I should \
like to see them.\" \"With all my heart,\" said he, and going into his own \
room he brought out an old valise secured with a little chain, on opening \
which the curate found in it three large books and some manuscripts written \
in a very good hand. The first that he opened he found to be \"Don Cirongilio \
of Thrace,\" and the second \"Don Felixmarte of Hircania,\" and the other the \
\"History of the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with the Life of \
Diego Garcia de Paredes.\" When the curate read the two first titles he \
looked over at the barber and said, \"We want my friend's housekeeper and \
niece here now.\" \"Nay,\" said the barber, \"I can do just as well to carry \
them to the yard or to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.\" \
\"What! your worship would burn my books!\" said the landlord. \"Only these \
two,\" said the curate, \"Don Cirongilio, and Felixmarte.\" \"Are my books, \
then, heretics or phlegmaties that you want to burn them?\" said the \
landlord. \"Schismatics you mean, friend,\" said the barber, \"not \
phlegmatics.\" \"That's it,\" said the landlord; \"but if you want to burn \
any, let it be that about the Great Captain and that Diego Garcia; for I \
would rather have a child of mine burnt than either of the others.\" \
\"Brother,\" said the curate, \"those two books are made up of lies, and are \
full of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a true history, \
and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who by his many and \
great achievements earned the title all over the world of the Great Captain, \
a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by him alone; and this Diego \
Garcia de Paredes was a distinguished knight of the city of Trujillo in \
Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and of such bodily strength that with \
one finger he stopped a mill-wheel in full motion; and posted with a \
two-handed sword at the foot of a bridge he kept the whole of an immense army \
from passing over it, and achieved such other exploits that if, instead of \
his relating them himself with the modesty of a knight and of one writing his \
own history, some free and unbiassed writer had recorded them, they would \
have thrown into the shade all the deeds of the Hectors, Achilleses, and \
Rolands.\" \"Tell that to my father,\" said the landlord. \"There's a thing \
to be astonished at! Stopping a mill-wheel! By God your worship should read \
what I have read of Felixmarte of Hircania, how with one single backstroke he \
cleft five giants asunder through the middle as if they had been made of \
bean-pods like the little friars the children make; and another time he \
attacked a very great and powerful army, in which there were more than a \
million six hundred thousand soldiers, all armed from head to foot, and he \
routed them all as if they had been flocks of sheep. \"And then, what do you \
say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that was so stout and bold; as may be \
seen in the book, where it is related that as he was sailing along a river \
there came up out of the midst of the water against him a fiery serpent, and \
he, as soon as he saw it, flung himself upon it and got astride of its scaly \
shoulders, and squeezed its throat with both hands with such force that the \
serpent, finding he was throttling it, had nothing for it but to let itself \
sink to the bottom of the river, carrying with it the knight who would not \
let go his hold; and when they got down there he found himself among palaces \
and gardens so pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent \
changed itself into an old ancient man, who told him such things as were \
never heard. Hold your peace, senor; for if you were to hear this you would \
go mad with delight. A couple of figs for your Great Captain and your Diego \
Garcia!\" Hearing this Dorothea said in a whisper to Cardenio, \"Our landlord \
is almost fit to play a second part to Don Quixote.\" \"I think so,\" said \
Cardenio, \"for, as he shows, he accepts it as a certainty that everything \
those books relate took place exactly as it is written down; and the \
barefooted friars themselves would not persuade him to the contrary.\" \"But \
consider, brother,\" said the curate once more, \"there never was any \
Felixmarte of Hircania in the world, nor any Cirongilio of Thrace, or any of \
the other knights of the same sort, that the books of chivalry talk of; the \
whole thing is the fabrication and invention of idle wits, devised by them \
for the purpose you describe of beguiling the time, as your reapers do when \
they read; for I swear to you in all seriousness there never were any such \
knights in the world, and no such exploits or nonsense ever happened \
anywhere.\" \"Try that bone on another dog,\" said the landlord; \"as if I \
did not know how many make five, and where my shoe pinches me; don't think to \
feed me with pap, for by God I am no fool. It is a good joke for your worship \
to try and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense and \
lies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the Royal Council, as \
if they were people who would allow such a lot of lies to be printed all \
together, and so many battles and enchantments that they take away one's \
senses.\" \"I have told you, friend,\" said the curate, \"that this is done \
to divert our idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of chess, \
fives, and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not care, \
or are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind are allowed \
to be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the truth, there can \
be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true stories; and if it were \
permitted me now, and the present company desired it, I could say something \
about the qualities books of chivalry should possess to be good ones, that \
would be to the advantage and even to the taste of some; but I hope the time \
will come when I can communicate my ideas to some one who may be able to mend \
matters; and in the meantime, senor landlord, believe what I have said, and \
take your books, and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood, and \
much good may they do you; and God grant you may not fall lame of the same \
foot your guest Don Quixote halts on.\" \"No fear of that,\" returned the \
landlord; \"I shall not be so mad as to make a knight-errant of myself; for I \
see well enough that things are not now as they used to be in those days, \
when they say those famous knights roamed about the world.\" Sancho had made \
his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and he was very much \
troubled and cast down by what he heard said about knights-errant being now \
no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalry being folly and lies; and he \
resolved in his heart to wait and see what came of this journey of his \
master's, and if it did not turn out as happily as his master expected, he \
determined to leave him and go back to his wife and children and his ordinary \
labour. The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the \
curate said to him, \"Wait; I want to see what those papers are that are \
written in such a good hand.\" The landlord taking them out handed them to \
him to read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of \
manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of \"Novel of \
the Ill-advised Curiosity.\" The curate read three or four lines to himself, \
and said, \"I must say the title of this novel does not seem to me a bad one, \
and I feel an inclination to read it all.\" To which the landlord replied, \
\"Then your reverence will do well to read it, for I can tell you that some \
guests who have read it here have been much pleased with it, and have begged \
it of me very earnestly; but I would not give it, meaning to return it to the \
person who forgot the valise, books, and papers here, for maybe he will \
return here some time or other; and though I know I shall miss the books, \
faith I mean to return them; for though I am an innkeeper, still I am a \
Christian.\" \"You are very right, friend,\" said the curate; \"but for all \
that, if the novel pleases me you must let me copy it.\" \"With all my heart,\
\" replied the host. While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel \
and begun to read it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he \
begged him to read it so that they might all hear it. \"I would read it,\" \
said the curate, \"if the time would not be better spent in sleeping.\" \"It \
will be rest enough for me,\" said Dorothea, \"to while away the time by \
listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me \
sleep when it would be seasonable.\" \"Well then, in that case,\" said the \
curate, \"I will read it, if it were only out of curiosity; perhaps it may \
contain something pleasant.\" Master Nicholas added his entreaties to the \
same effect, and Sancho too; seeing which, and considering that he would give \
pleasure to all, and receive it himself, the curate said, \"Well then, attend \
to me everyone, for the novel begins thus.\" CHAPTER XXXIII. IN WHICH IS \
RELATED THE NOVEL OF \"THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\" In Florence, a rich and \
famous city of Italy in the province called Tuscany, there lived two \
gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and Lothario, such great friends \
that by way of distinction they were called by all that knew them \"The Two \
Friends.\" They were unmarried, young, of the same age and of the same \
tastes, which was enough to account for the reciprocal friendship between \
them. Anselmo, it is true, was somewhat more inclined to seek pleasure in \
love than Lothario, for whom the pleasures of the chase had more attraction; \
but on occasion Anselmo would forego his own tastes to yield to those of \
Lothario, and Lothario would surrender his to fall in with those of Anselmo, \
and in this way their inclinations kept pace one with the other with a \
concord so perfect that the best regulated clock could not surpass it. \
Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the same \
city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable herself, that he \
resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario, without whom he did \
nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did so, Lothario being the \
bearer of the demand, and conducting the negotiation so much to the \
satisfaction of his friend that in a short time he was in possession of the \
object of his desires, and Camilla so happy in having won Anselmo for her \
husband, that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario, by whose \
means such good fortune had fallen to her. The first few days, those of a \
wedding being usually days of merry-making, Lothario frequented his friend \
Anselmo's house as he had been wont, striving to do honour to him and to the \
occasion, and to gratify him in every way he could; but when the wedding days \
were over and the succession of visits and congratulations had slackened, he \
began purposely to leave off going to the house of Anselmo, for it seemed to \
him, as it naturally would to all men of sense, that friends' houses ought \
not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency as in their masters' \
bachelor days: because, though true and genuine friendship cannot and should \
not be in any way suspicious, still a married man's honour is a thing of such \
delicacy that it is held liable to injury from brothers, much more from \
friends. Anselmo remarked the cessation of Lothario's visits, and complained \
of it to him, saying that if he had known that marriage was to keep him from \
enjoying his society as he used, he would have never married; and that, if by \
the thorough harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelor they \
had earned such a sweet name as that of \"The Two Friends,\" he should not \
allow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through a needless anxiety \
to act circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such a phrase was allowable \
between them, to be once more master of his house and to come in and go out \
as formerly, assuring him that his wife Camilla had no other desire or \
inclination than that which he would wish her to have, and that knowing how \
sincerely they loved one another she was grieved to see such coldness in him. \
To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him to \
come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario replied with \
so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was satisfied of his \
friend's good intentions, and it was agreed that on two days in the week, and \
on holidays, Lothario should come to dine with him; but though this \
arrangement was made between them Lothario resolved to observe it no further \
than he considered to be in accordance with the honour of his friend, whose \
good name was more to him than his own. He said, and justly, that a married \
man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as \
carefully what friends he brought to his house as what female friends his \
wife associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in the \
market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations (opportunities \
that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may be easily managed in the \
house of the female friend or relative in whom most confidence is reposed. \
Lothario said, too, that every married man should have some friend who would \
point out to him any negligence he might be guilty of in his conduct, for it \
will sometimes happen that owing to the deep affection the husband bears his \
wife either he does not caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from \
telling her to do or not to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be \
a matter of honour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could \
easily correct if warned by a friend. But where is such a friend to be found \
as Lothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and so true? Of a truth I \
know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the utmost care and \
vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, and strove to diminish, \
cut down, and reduce the number of days for going to his house according to \
their agreement, lest the visits of a young man, wealthy, high-born, and with \
the attractions he was conscious of possessing, at the house of a woman so \
beautiful as Camilla, should be regarded with suspicion by the inquisitive \
and malicious eyes of the idle public. For though his integrity and \
reputation might bridle slanderous tongues, still he was unwilling to hazard \
either his own good name or that of his friend; and for this reason most of \
the days agreed upon he devoted to some other business which he pretended was \
unavoidable; so that a great portion of the day was taken up with complaints \
on one side and excuses on the other. It happened, however, that on one \
occasion when the two were strolling together outside the city, Anselmo \
addressed the following words to Lothario. \"Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my \
friend, that I am unable to give sufficient thanks for the favours God has \
rendered me in making me the son of such parents as mine were, and bestowing \
upon me with no niggard hand what are called the gifts of nature as well as \
those of fortune, and above all for what he has done in giving me thee for a \
friend and Camilla for a wife--two treasures that I value, if not as highly \
as I ought, at least as highly as I am able. And yet, with all these good \
things, which are commonly all that men need to enable them to live happily, \
I am the most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole world; for, I \
know not how long since, I have been harassed and oppressed by a desire so \
strange and so unusual, that I wonder at myself and blame and chide myself \
when I am alone, and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own thoughts, \
and with no better success than if I were endeavouring deliberately to \
publish it to all the world; and as, in short, it must come out, I would \
confide it to thy safe keeping, feeling sure that by this means, and by thy \
readiness as a true friend to afford me relief, I shall soon find myself \
freed from the distress it causes me, and that thy care will give me \
happiness in the same degree as my own folly has caused me misery.\" The \
words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he was to \
conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though be strove to \
imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend, his conjectures \
were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety which this perplexity \
was causing him, he told him he was doing a flagrant injustice to their great \
friendship in seeking circuitous methods of confiding to him his most hidden \
thoughts, for he well knew he might reckon upon his counsel in diverting \
them, or his help in carrying them into effect. \"That is the truth,\" \
replied Anselmo, \"and relying upon that I will tell thee, friend Lothario, \
that the desire which harasses me is that of knowing whether my wife Camilla \
is as good and as perfect as I think her to be; and I cannot satisfy myself \
of the truth on this point except by testing her in such a way that the trial \
may prove the purity of her virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I \
am persuaded, my friend, that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she \
is or is not tempted; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the \
promises, gifts, tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what thanks \
does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be bad, and what \
wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity is \
given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband that will take her life \
the first time he detects her in an impropriety? I do not therefore hold her \
who is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in the same estimation as \
her who comes out of temptation and trial with a crown of victory; and so, \
for these reasons and many others that I could give thee to justify and \
support the opinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass \
this crisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooed \
and by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she comes out, as I \
know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look upon my good \
fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of my desire is \
full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says 'Who shall find her?' \
has fallen to my lot. And if the result be the contrary of what I expect, in \
the satisfaction of knowing that I have been right in my opinion, I shall \
bear without complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will \
naturally cause me. And, as nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my \
wish will avail to keep me from carrying it into effect, it is my desire, \
friend Lothario, that thou shouldst consent to become the instrument for \
effecting this purpose that I am bent upon, for I will afford thee \
opportunities to that end, and nothing shall be wanting that I may think \
necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous, honourable, modest and high-minded \
woman. And among other reasons, I am induced to entrust this arduous task to \
thee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by thee the conquest \
will not be pushed to extremes, but only far enough to account that \
accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone; thus I shall \
not be wronged in anything more than intention, and my wrong will remain \
buried in the integrity of thy silence, which I know well will be as lasting \
as that of death in what concerns me. If, therefore, thou wouldst have me \
enjoy what can be called life, thou wilt at once engage in this love \
struggle, not lukewarmly nor slothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my \
desire demands, and with the loyalty our friendship assures me of.\" Such \
were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to them with such \
attention that, except to say what has been already mentioned, he did not \
open his lips until the other had finished. Then perceiving that he had no \
more to say, after regarding him for awhile, as one would regard something \
never before seen that excited wonder and amazement, he said to him, \"I \
cannot persuade myself, Anselmo my friend, that what thou hast said to me is \
not in jest; if I thought that thou wert speaking seriously I would not have \
allowed thee to go so far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not \
listening to thee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do \
not know thee; but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that I \
am Lothario; the misfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not the Anselmo \
thou wert, and must have thought that I am not the Lothario I should be; for \
the things that thou hast said to me are not those of that Anselmo who was my \
friend, nor are those that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the \
Lothario thou knowest. True friends will prove their friends and make use of \
them, as a poet has said, usque ad aras; whereby he meant that they will not \
make use of their friendship in things that are contrary to God's will. If \
this, then, was a heathen's feeling about friendship, how much more should it \
be a Christian's, who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the \
sake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go so far as to put \
aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend, it should not be \
in matters that are trifling or of little moment, but in such as affect the \
friend's life and honour. Now tell me, Anselmo, in which of these two art \
thou imperilled, that I should hazard myself to gratify thee, and do a thing \
so detestable as that thou seekest of me? Neither forsooth; on the contrary, \
thou dost ask of me, so far as I understand, to strive and labour to rob thee \
of honour and life, and to rob myself of them at the same time; for if I take \
away thy honour it is plain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is \
worse than dead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so \
much wrong to thee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, and \
consequently without life? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not \
impatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching the \
object of thy desire, for there will be time enough left for thee to reply \
and for me to hear.\" \"Be it so,\" said Anselmo, \"say what thou wilt.\" \
Lothario then went on to say, \"It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine is just \
now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can never be \
brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the Holy \
Scriptures, or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the \
understanding or are founded upon the articles of faith, but must have \
examples that are palpable, easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not \
admitting of doubt, with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be denied, \
like, 'If equals be taken from equals, the remainders are equal:' and if they \
do not understand this in words, and indeed they do not, it has to be shown \
to them with the hands, and put before their eyes, and even with all this no \
one succeeds in convincing them of the truth of our holy religion. This same \
mode of proceeding I shall have to adopt with thee, for the desire which has \
sprung up in thee is so absurd and remote from everything that has a \
semblance of reason, that I feel it would be a waste of time to employ it in \
reasoning with thy simplicity, for at present I will call it by no other \
name; and I am even tempted to leave thee in thy folly as a punishment for \
thy pernicious desire; but the friendship I bear thee, which will not allow \
me to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruction, keeps me from \
dealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayest clearly see this, say, \
Anselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit upon a modest woman, \
decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that is pure-minded, pay \
court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast told me so. Then, if thou \
knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous, pure-minded and prudent, \
what is it that thou seekest? And if thou believest that she will come forth \
victorious from all my attacks--as doubtless she would--what higher titles \
than those she possesses now dost thou think thou canst upon her then, or in \
what will she be better then than she is now? Either thou dost not hold her \
to be what thou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dost demand. If thou \
dost not hold her to be what thou why dost thou seek to prove her instead of \
treating her as guilty in the way that may seem best to thee? but if she be \
as virtuous as thou believest, it is an uncalled-for proceeding to make trial \
of truth itself, for, after trial, it will but be in the same estimation as \
before. Thus, then, it is conclusive that to attempt things from which harm \
rather than advantage may come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless \
minds, more especially when they are things which we are not forced or \
compelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it is plainly madness to \
attempt them. \"Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for \
the sake of the world, or for both; those undertaken for God's sake are those \
which the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of angels in \
human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are those of the men \
who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a variety of climates, so \
many strange countries, to acquire what are called the blessings of fortune; \
and those undertaken for the sake of God and the world together are those of \
brave soldiers, who no sooner do they see in the enemy's wall a breach as \
wide as a cannon ball could make, than, casting aside all fear, without \
hesitating, or heeding the manifest peril that threatens them, borne onward \
by the desire of defending their faith, their country, and their king, they \
fling themselves dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deaths \
that await them. Such are the things that men are wont to attempt, and there \
is honour, glory, gain, in attempting them, however full of difficulty and \
peril they may be; but that which thou sayest it is thy wish to attempt and \
carry out will not win thee the glory of God nor the blessings of fortune nor \
fame among men; for even if the issue he as thou wouldst have it, thou wilt \
be no happier, richer, or more honoured than thou art this moment; and if it \
be otherwise thou wilt be reduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for \
then it will avail thee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the \
misfortune that has befallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee \
that thou knowest it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, \
let me repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo at the \
end of the first part of his 'Tears of Saint Peter,' which says thus: The \
anguish and the shame but greater grew In Peter's heart as morning slowly \
came; No eye was there to see him, well he knew, Yet he himself was to \
himself a shame; Exposed to all men's gaze, or screened from view, A noble \
heart will feel the pang the same; A prey to shame the sinning soul will be, \
Though none but heaven and earth its shame can see. Thus by keeping it secret \
thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather thou wilt shed tears unceasingly, \
if not tears of the eyes, tears of blood from the heart, like those shed by \
that simple doctor our poet tells us of, that tried the test of the cup, \
which the wise Rinaldo, better advised, refused to do; for though this may be \
a poetic fiction it contains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and \
imitation. Moreover by what I am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see \
the great error thou wouldst commit. \"Tell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good \
fortune had made thee master and lawful owner of a diamond of the finest \
quality, with the excellence and purity of which all the lapidaries that had \
seen it had been satisfied, saying with one voice and common consent that in \
purity, quality, and fineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could \
possibly be, thou thyself too being of the same belief, as knowing nothing to \
the contrary, would it be reasonable in thee to desire to take that diamond \
and place it between an anvil and a hammer, and by mere force of blows and \
strength of arm try if it were as hard and as fine as they said? And if thou \
didst, and if the stone should resist so silly a test, that would add nothing \
to its value or reputation; and if it were broken, as it might be, would not \
all be lost? Undoubtedly it would, leaving its owner to be rated as a fool in \
the opinion of all. Consider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla is a \
diamond of the finest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of others, \
and that it is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk of being broken; \
for if she remains intact she cannot rise to a higher value than she now \
possesses; and if she give way and be unable to resist, bethink thee now how \
thou wilt be deprived of her, and with what good reason thou wilt complain of \
thyself for having been the cause of her ruin and thine own. Remember there \
is no jewel in the world so precious as a chaste and virtuous woman, and that \
the whole honour of women consists in reputation; and since thy wife's is of \
that high excellence that thou knowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call \
that truth in question? Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect \
animal, and that impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her trip \
and fall, but that they should be removed, and her path left clear of all \
obstacles, so that without hindrance she may run her course freely to attain \
the desired perfection, which consists in being virtuous. Naturalists tell us \
that the ermine is a little animal which has a fur of purest white, and that \
when the hunters wish to take it, they make use of this artifice. Having \
ascertained the places which it frequents and passes, they stop the way to \
them with mud, and then rousing it, drive it towards the spot, and as soon as \
the ermine comes to the mud it halts, and allows itself to be taken captive \
rather than pass through the mire, and spoil and sully its whiteness, which \
it values more than life and liberty. The virtuous and chaste woman is an \
ermine, and whiter and purer than snow is the virtue of modesty; and he who \
wishes her not to lose it, but to keep and preserve it, must adopt a course \
different from that employed with the ermine; he must not put before her the \
mire of the gifts and attentions of persevering lovers, because perhaps--and \
even without a perhaps--she may not have sufficient virtue and natural \
strength in herself to pass through and tread under foot these impediments; \
they must be removed, and the brightness of virtue and the beauty of a fair \
fame must be put before her. A virtuous woman, too, is like a mirror, of \
clear shining crystal, liable to be tarnished and dimmed by every breath that \
touches it. She must be treated as relics are; adored, not touched. She must \
be protected and prized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of \
roses and flowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or pluck a \
blossom; enough for others that from afar and through the iron grating they \
may enjoy its fragrance and its beauty. Finally let me repeat to thee some \
verses that come to my mind; I heard them in a modern comedy, and it seems to \
me they bear upon the point we are discussing. A prudent old man was giving \
advice to another, the father of a young girl, to lock her up, watch over her \
and keep her in seclusion, and among other arguments he used these: Woman is \
a thing of glass; But her brittleness 'tis best Not too curiously to test: \
Who knows what may come to pass? Breaking is an easy matter, And it's folly \
to expose What you cannot mend to blows; What you can't make whole to \
shatter. This, then, all may hold as true, And the reason's plain to see; For \
if Danaes there be, There are golden showers too. \"All that I have said to \
thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to what concerns thee; now it is \
right that I should say something of what regards myself; and if I be prolix, \
pardon me, for the labyrinth into which thou hast entered and from which thou \
wouldst have me extricate thee makes it necessary. \"Thou dost reckon me thy \
friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, a thing wholly inconsistent with \
friendship; and not only dost thou aim at this, but thou wouldst have me rob \
thee of it also. That thou wouldst rob me of it is clear, for when Camilla \
sees that I pay court to her as thou requirest, she will certainly regard me \
as a man without honour or right feeling, since I attempt and do a thing so \
much opposed to what I owe to my own position and thy friendship. That thou \
wouldst have me rob thee of it is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I \
press my suit upon her, will suppose that I have perceived in her something \
light that has encouraged me to make known to her my base desire; and if she \
holds herself dishonoured, her dishonour touches thee as belonging to her; \
and hence arises what so commonly takes place, that the husband of the \
adulterous woman, though he may not be aware of or have given any cause for \
his wife's failure in her duty, or (being careless or negligent) have had it \
in his power to prevent his dishonour, nevertheless is stigmatised by a vile \
and reproachful name, and in a manner regarded with eyes of contempt instead \
of pity by all who know of his wife's guilt, though they see that he is \
unfortunate not by his own fault, but by the lust of a vicious consort. But I \
will tell thee why with good reason dishonour attaches to the husband of the \
unchaste wife, though he know not that she is so, nor be to blame, nor have \
done anything, or given any provocation to make her so; and be not weary with \
listening to me, for it will be for thy good. \"When God created our first \
parent in the earthly paradise, the Holy Scripture says that he infused sleep \
into Adam and while he slept took a rib from his left side of which he formed \
our mother Eve, and when Adam awoke and beheld her he said, 'This is flesh of \
my flesh, and bone of my bone.' And God said 'For this shall a man leave his \
father and his mother, and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was \
instituted the divine sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone \
can loose them. And such is the force and virtue of this miraculous sacrament \
that it makes two different persons one and the same flesh; and even more \
than this when the virtuous are married; for though they have two souls they \
have but one will. And hence it follows that as the flesh of the wife is one \
and the same with that of her husband the stains that may come upon it, or \
the injuries it incurs fall upon the husband's flesh, though he, as has been \
said, may have given no cause for them; for as the pain of the foot or any \
member of the body is felt by the whole body, because all is one flesh, as \
the head feels the hurt to the ankle without having caused it, so the \
husband, being one with her, shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all \
worldly honour or dishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erring wife's \
is of that kind, the husband must needs bear his part of it and be held \
dishonoured without knowing it. See, then, Anselmo, the peril thou art \
encountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort; see for \
what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse up passions that \
now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife; reflect that what thou \
art staking all to win is little, and what thou wilt lose so much that I \
leave it undescribed, not having the words to express it. But if all I have \
said be not enough to turn thee from thy vile purpose, thou must seek some \
other instrument for thy dishonour and misfortune; for such I will not \
consent to be, though I lose thy friendship, the greatest loss that I can \
conceive.\" Having said this, the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, and \
Anselmo, troubled in mind and deep in thought, was unable for a while to \
utter a word in reply; but at length he said, \"I have listened, Lothario my \
friend, attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hast chosen to say to \
me, and in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons I have seen that high \
intelligence thou dost possess, and the perfection of true friendship thou \
hast reached; and likewise I see and confess that if I am not guided by thy \
opinion, but follow my own, I am flying from the good and pursuing the evil. \
This being so, thou must remember that I am now labouring under that \
infirmity which women sometimes suffer from, when the craving seizes them to \
eat clay, plaster, charcoal, and things even worse, disgusting to look at, \
much more to eat; so that it will be necessary to have recourse to some \
artifice to cure me; and this can be easily effected if only thou wilt make a \
beginning, even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believe fashion, to pay \
court to Camilla, who will not be so yielding that her virtue will give way \
at the first attack: with this mere attempt I shall rest satisfied, and thou \
wilt have done what our friendship binds thee to do, not only in giving me \
life, but in persuading me not to discard my honour. And this thou art bound \
to do for one reason alone, that, being, as I am, resolved to apply this \
test, it is not for thee to permit me to reveal my weakness to another, and \
so imperil that honour thou art striving to keep me from losing; and if thine \
may not stand as high as it ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art \
paying court to her, that is of little or no importance, because ere long, on \
finding in her that constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her the plain \
truth as regards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in her esteem; and as \
thou art venturing so little, and by the venture canst afford me so much \
satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even if further difficulties \
present themselves to thee; for, as I have said, if thou wilt only make a \
beginning I will acknowledge the issue decided.\" Lothario seeing the fixed \
determination of Anselmo, and not knowing what further examples to offer or \
arguments to urge in order to dissuade him from it, and perceiving that he \
threatened to confide his pernicious scheme to some one else, to avoid a \
greater evil resolved to gratify him and do what he asked, intending to \
manage the business so as to satisfy Anselmo without corrupting the mind of \
Camilla; so in reply he told him not to communicate his purpose to any other, \
for he would undertake the task himself, and would begin it as soon as he \
pleased. Anselmo embraced him warmly and affectionately, and thanked him for \
his offer as if he had bestowed some great favour upon him; and it was agreed \
between them to set about it the next day, Anselmo affording opportunity and \
time to Lothario to converse alone with Camilla, and furnishing him with \
money and jewels to offer and present to her. He suggested, too, that he \
should treat her to music, and write verses in her praise, and if he was \
unwilling to take the trouble of composing them, he offered to do it himself. \
Lothario agreed to all with an intention very different from what Anselmo \
supposed, and with this understanding they returned to Anselmo's house, where \
they found Camilla awaiting her husband anxiously and uneasily, for he was \
later than usual in returning that day. Lothario repaired to his own house, \
and Anselmo remained in his, as well satisfied as Lothario was troubled in \
mind; for he could see no satisfactory way out of this ill-advised business. \
That night, however, he thought of a plan by which he might deceive Anselmo \
without any injury to Camilla. The next day he went to dine with his friend, \
and was welcomed by Camilla, who received and treated him with great \
cordiality, knowing the affection her husband felt for him. When dinner was \
over and the cloth removed, Anselmo told Lothario to stay there with Camilla \
while he attended to some pressing business, as he would return in an hour \
and a half. Camilla begged him not to go, and Lothario offered to accompany \
him, but nothing could persuade Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario \
to remain waiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss \
with him. At the same time he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until \
he came back. In short he contrived to put so good a face on the reason, or \
the folly, of his absence that no one could have suspected it was a pretence. \
Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone at the \
table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothario saw himself \
in the lists according to his friend's wish, and facing an enemy that could \
by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed knights; judge whether he \
had good reason to fear; but what he did was to lean his elbow on the arm of \
the chair, and his cheek upon his hand, and, asking Camilla's pardon for his \
ill manners, he said he wished to take a little sleep until Anselmo returned. \
Camilla in reply said he could repose more at his ease in the reception-room \
than in his chair, and begged of him to go in and sleep there; but Lothario \
declined, and there he remained asleep until the return of Anselmo, who \
finding Camilla in her own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined that he had \
stayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough for conversation and \
even for sleep, and was all impatience until Lothario should wake up, that he \
might go out with him and question him as to his success. Everything fell out \
as he wished; Lothario awoke, and the two at once left the house, and Anselmo \
asked what he was anxious to know, and Lothario in answer told him that he \
had not thought it advisable to declare himself entirely the first time, and \
therefore had only extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her that all the \
city spoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit, for this seemed to him an \
excellent way of beginning to gain her good-will and render her disposed to \
listen to him with pleasure the next time, thus availing himself of the \
device the devil has recourse to when he would deceive one who is on the \
watch; for he being the angel of darkness transforms himself into an angel of \
light, and, under cover of a fair seeming, discloses himself at length, and \
effects his purpose if at the beginning his wiles are not discovered. All \
this gave great satisfaction to Anselmo, and he said he would afford the same \
opportunity every day, but without leaving the house, for he would find \
things to do at home so that Camilla should not detect the plot. Thus, then, \
several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a word to Camilla, \
reported to Anselmo that he had talked with her and that he had never been \
able to draw from her the slightest indication of consent to anything \
dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of hope; on the contrary, he said \
she would inform her husband of it. \"So far well,\" said Anselmo; \"Camilla \
has thus far resisted words; we must now see how she will resist deeds. I \
will give you to-morrow two thousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even \
present, and as many more to buy jewels to lure her, for women are fond of \
being becomingly attired and going gaily dressed, and all the more so if they \
are beautiful, however chaste they may be; and if she resists this \
temptation, I will rest satisfied and will give you no more trouble.\" \
Lothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the undertaking to \
the end, though he perceived he was to come out of it wearied and vanquished. \
The next day he received the four thousand crowns, and with them four \
thousand perplexities, for he knew not what to say by way of a new falsehood; \
but in the end he made up his mind to tell him that Camilla stood as firm \
against gifts and promises as against words, and that there was no use in \
taking any further trouble, for the time was all spent to no purpose. But \
chance, directing things in a different manner, so ordered it that Anselmo, \
having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions, shut himself \
into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen through the keyhole to \
what passed between them, and perceived that for more than half an hour \
Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor would utter a word though he \
were to be there for an age; and he came to the conclusion that what his \
friend had told him about the replies of Camilla was all invention and \
falsehood, and to ascertain if it were so, he came out, and calling Lothario \
aside asked him what news he had and in what humour Camilla was. Lothario \
replied that he was not disposed to go on with the business, for she had \
answered him so angrily and harshly that he had no heart to say anything more \
to her. \"Ah, Lothario, Lothario,\" said Anselmo, \"how ill dost thou meet \
thy obligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee! I have been \
just now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou has not \
said a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former occasions thou \
hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as no doubt it is, why dost \
thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou by craft to deprive me of the \
means I might find of attaining my desire?\" Anselmo said no more, but he had \
said enough to cover Lothario with shame and confusion, and he, feeling as it \
were his honour touched by having been detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo \
that he would from that moment devote himself to satisfying him without any \
deception, as he would see if he had the curiosity to watch; though he need \
not take the trouble, for the pains he would take to satisfy him would remove \
all suspicions from his mind. Anselmo believed him, and to afford him an \
opportunity more free and less liable to surprise, he resolved to absent \
himself from his house for eight days, betaking himself to that of a friend \
of his who lived in a village not far from the city; and, the better to \
account for his departure to Camilla, he so arranged it that the friend \
should send him a very pressing invitation. Unhappy, shortsighted Anselmo, \
what art thou doing, what art thou plotting, what art thou devising? Bethink \
thee thou art working against thyself, plotting thine own dishonour, devising \
thine own ruin. Thy wife Camilla is virtuous, thou dost possess her in peace \
and quietness, no one assails thy happiness, her thoughts wander not beyond \
the walls of thy house, thou art her heaven on earth, the object of her \
wishes, the fulfilment of her desires, the measure wherewith she measures her \
will, making it conform in all things to thine and Heaven's. If, then, the \
mine of her honour, beauty, virtue, and modesty yields thee without labour \
all the wealth it contains and thou canst wish for, why wilt thou dig the \
earth in search of fresh veins, of new unknown treasure, risking the collapse \
of all, since it but rests on the feeble props of her weak nature? Bethink \
thee that from him who seeks impossibilities that which is possible may with \
justice be withheld, as was better expressed by a poet who said: 'Tis mine to \
seek for life in death, Health in disease seek I, I seek in prison freedom's \
breath, In traitors loyalty. So Fate that ever scorns to grant Or grace or \
boon to me, Since what can never be I want, Denies me what might be. The next \
day Anselmo took his departure for the village, leaving instructions with \
Camilla that during his absence Lothario would come to look after his house \
and to dine with her, and that she was to treat him as she would himself. \
Camilla was distressed, as a discreet and right-minded woman would be, at the \
orders her husband left her, and bade him remember that it was not becoming \
that anyone should occupy his seat at the table during his absence, and if he \
acted thus from not feeling confidence that she would be able to manage his \
house, let him try her this time, and he would find by experience that she \
was equal to greater responsibilities. Anselmo replied that it was his \
pleasure to have it so, and that she had only to submit and obey. Camilla \
said she would do so, though against her will. Anselmo went, and the next day \
Lothario came to his house, where he was received by Camilla with a friendly \
and modest welcome; but she never suffered Lothario to see her alone, for she \
was always attended by her men and women servants, especially by a handmaid \
of hers, Leonela by name, to whom she was much attached (for they had been \
brought up together from childhood in her father's house), and whom she had \
kept with her after her marriage with Anselmo. The first three days Lothario \
did not speak to her, though he might have done so when they removed the \
cloth and the servants retired to dine hastily; for such were Camilla's \
orders; nay more, Leonela had directions to dine earlier than Camilla and \
never to leave her side. She, however, having her thoughts fixed upon other \
things more to her taste, and wanting that time and opportunity for her own \
pleasures, did not always obey her mistress's commands, but on the contrary \
left them alone, as if they had ordered her to do so; but the modest bearing \
of Camilla, the calmness of her countenance, the composure of her aspect were \
enough to bridle the tongue of Lothario. But the influence which the many \
virtues of Camilla exerted in imposing silence on Lothario's tongue proved \
mischievous for both of them, for if his tongue was silent his thoughts were \
busy, and could dwell at leisure upon the perfections of Camilla's goodness \
and beauty one by one, charms enough to warm with love a marble statue, not \
to say a heart of flesh. Lothario gazed upon her when he might have been \
speaking to her, and thought how worthy of being loved she was; and thus \
reflection began little by little to assail his allegiance to Anselmo, and a \
thousand times he thought of withdrawing from the city and going where \
Anselmo should never see him nor he see Camilla. But already the delight he \
found in gazing on her interposed and held him fast. He put a constraint upon \
himself, and struggled to repel and repress the pleasure he found in \
contemplating Camilla; when alone he blamed himself for his weakness, called \
himself a bad friend, nay a bad Christian; then he argued the matter and \
compared himself with Anselmo; always coming to the conclusion that the folly \
and rashness of Anselmo had been worse than his faithlessness, and that if he \
could excuse his intentions as easily before God as with man, he had no \
reason to fear any punishment for his offence. In short the beauty and \
goodness of Camilla, joined with the opportunity which the blind husband had \
placed in his hands, overthrew the loyalty of Lothario; and giving heed to \
nothing save the object towards which his inclinations led him, after Anselmo \
had been three days absent, during which he had been carrying on a continual \
struggle with his passion, he began to make love to Camilla with so much \
vehemence and warmth of language that she was overwhelmed with amazement, and \
could only rise from her place and retire to her room without answering him a \
word. But the hope which always springs up with love was not weakened in \
Lothario by this repelling demeanour; on the contrary his passion for Camilla \
increased, and she discovering in him what she had never expected, knew not \
what to do; and considering it neither safe nor right to give him the chance \
or opportunity of speaking to her again, she resolved to send, as she did \
that very night, one of her servants with a letter to Anselmo, in which she \
addressed the following words to him. CHAPTER XXXIV. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED \
THE NOVEL OF \"THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\" \"It is commonly said that an army \
looks ill without its general and a castle without its castellan, and I say \
that a young married woman looks still worse without her husband unless there \
are very good reasons for it. I find myself so ill at ease without you, and \
so incapable of enduring this separation, that unless you return quickly I \
shall have to go for relief to my parents' house, even if I leave yours \
without a protector; for the one you left me, if indeed he deserved that \
title, has, I think, more regard to his own pleasure than to what concerns \
you: as you are possessed of discernment I need say no more to you, nor \
indeed is it fitting I should say more.\" Anselmo received this letter, and \
from it he gathered that Lothario had already begun his task and that Camilla \
must have replied to him as he would have wished; and delighted beyond \
measure at such intelligence he sent word to her not to leave his house on \
any account, as he would very shortly return. Camilla was astonished at \
Anselmo's reply, which placed her in greater perplexity than before, for she \
neither dared to remain in her own house, nor yet to go to her parents'; for \
in remaining her virtue was imperilled, and in going she was opposing her \
husband's commands. Finally she decided upon what was the worse course for \
her, to remain, resolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario, that she \
might not give food for gossip to her servants; and she now began to regret \
having written as she had to her husband, fearing he might imagine that \
Lothario had perceived in her some lightness which had impelled him to lay \
aside the respect he owed her; but confident of her rectitude she put her \
trust in God and in her own virtuous intentions, with which she hoped to \
resist in silence all the solicitations of Lothario, without saying anything \
to her husband so as not to involve him in any quarrel or trouble; and she \
even began to consider how to excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he should ask \
her what it was that induced her to write that letter. With these \
resolutions, more honourable than judicious or effectual, she remained the \
next day listening to Lothario, who pressed his suit so strenuously that \
Camilla's firmness began to waver, and her virtue had enough to do to come to \
the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of a certain tender \
compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario had awakened in her bosom. \
Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed him all the more. In short he \
felt that while Anselmo's absence afforded time and opportunity he must press \
the siege of the fortress, and so he assailed her self-esteem with praises of \
her beauty, for there is nothing that more quickly reduces and levels the \
castle towers of fair women's vanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of \
flattery. In fact with the utmost assiduity he undermined the rock of her \
purity with such engines that had Camilla been of brass she must have fallen. \
He wept, he entreated, he promised, he flattered, he importuned, he pretended \
with so much feeling and apparent sincerity, that he overthrew the virtuous \
resolves of Camilla and won the triumph he least expected and most longed \
for. Camilla yielded, Camilla fell; but what wonder if the friendship of \
Lothario could not stand firm? A clear proof to us that the passion of love \
is to be conquered only by flying from it, and that no one should engage in a \
struggle with an enemy so mighty; for divine strength is needed to overcome \
his human power. Leonela alone knew of her mistress's weakness, for the two \
false friends and new lovers were unable to conceal it. Lothario did not care \
to tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view, nor that he had afforded him \
the opportunity of attaining such a result, lest she should undervalue his \
love and think that it was by chance and without intending it and not of his \
own accord that he had made love to her. A few days later Anselmo returned to \
his house and did not perceive what it had lost, that which he so lightly \
treated and so highly prized. He went at once to see Lothario, and found him \
at home; they embraced each other, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his \
life or his death. \"The tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend,\" \
said Lothario, \"are that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the \
pattern and crown of all good wives. The words that I have addressed to her \
were borne away on the wind, my promises have been despised, my presents have \
been refused, such feigned tears as I shed have been turned into open \
ridicule. In short, as Camilla is the essence of all beauty, so is she the \
treasure-house where purity dwells, and gentleness and modesty abide with all \
the virtues that can confer praise, honour, and happiness upon a woman. Take \
back thy money, my friend; here it is, and I have had no need to touch it, \
for the chastity of Camilla yields not to things so base as gifts or \
promises. Be content, Anselmo, and refrain from making further proof; and as \
thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts and suspicions that \
are and may be entertained of women, seek not to plunge again into the deep \
ocean of new embarrassments, or with another pilot make trial of the goodness \
and strength of the bark that Heaven has granted thee for thy passage across \
the sea of this world; but reckon thyself now safe in port, moor thyself with \
the anchor of sound reflection, and rest in peace until thou art called upon \
to pay that debt which no nobility on earth can escape paying.\" Anselmo was \
completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believed them as fully as \
if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless he begged of him not to \
relinquish the undertaking, were it but for the sake of curiosity and \
amusement; though thenceforward he need not make use of the same earnest \
endeavours as before; all he wished him to do was to write some verses to \
her, praising her under the name of Chloris, for he himself would give her to \
understand that he was in love with a lady to whom he had given that name to \
enable him to sing her praises with the decorum due to her modesty; and if \
Lothario were unwilling to take the trouble of writing the verses he would \
compose them himself. \"That will not be necessary,\" said Lothario, \"for \
the muses are not such enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in \
the course of the year. Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a \
pretended amour of mine; as for the verses will make them, and if not as good \
as the subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can produce.\" An \
agreement to this effect was made between the friends, the ill-advised one \
and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his house asked Camilla the \
question she already wondered he had not asked before--what it was that had \
caused her to write the letter she had sent him. Camilla replied that it had \
seemed to her that Lothario looked at her somewhat more freely than when he \
had been at home; but that now she was undeceived and believed it to have \
been only her own imagination, for Lothario now avoided seeing her, or being \
alone with her. Anselmo told her she might be quite easy on the score of that \
suspicion, for he knew that Lothario was in love with a damsel of rank in the \
city whom he celebrated under the name of Chloris, and that even if he were \
not, his fidelity and their great friendship left no room for fear. Had not \
Camilla, however, been informed beforehand by Lothario that this love for \
Chloris was a pretence, and that he himself had told Anselmo of it in order \
to be able sometimes to give utterance to the praises of Camilla herself, no \
doubt she would have fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy; but being \
forewarned she received the startling news without uneasiness. The next day \
as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to recite something of what \
he had composed for his mistress Chloris; for as Camilla did not know her, he \
might safely say what he liked. \"Even did she know her,\" returned Lothario, \
\"I would hide nothing, for when a lover praises his lady's beauty, and \
charges her with cruelty, he casts no imputation upon her fair name; at any \
rate, all I can say is that yesterday I made a sonnet on the ingratitude of \
this Chloris, which goes thus: SONNET At midnight, in the silence, when the \
eyes Of happier mortals balmy slumbers close, The weary tale of my unnumbered \
woes To Chloris and to Heaven is wont to rise. And when the light of day \
returning dyes The portals of the east with tints of rose, With undiminished \
force my sorrow flows In broken accents and in burning sighs. And when the \
sun ascends his star-girt throne, And on the earth pours down his midday \
beams, Noon but renews my wailing and my tears; And with the night again goes \
up my moan. Yet ever in my agony it seems To me that neither Heaven nor \
Chloris hears.\" The sonnet pleased Camilla, and still more Anselmo, for he \
praised it and said the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for \
sincerity so manifest. On which Camilla said, \"Then all that love-smitten \
poets say is true?\" \"As poets they do not tell the truth,\" replied \
Lothario; \"but as lovers they are not more defective in expression than they \
are truthful.\" \"There is no doubt of that,\" observed Anselmo, anxious to \
support and uphold Lothario's ideas with Camilla, who was as regardless of \
his design as she was deep in love with Lothario; and so taking delight in \
anything that was his, and knowing that his thoughts and writings had her for \
their object, and that she herself was the real Chloris, she asked him to \
repeat some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any. \"I do,\" replied \
Lothario, \"but I do not think it as good as the first one, or, more \
correctly speaking, less bad; but you can easily judge, for it is this. \
SONNET I know that I am doomed; death is to me As certain as that thou, \
ungrateful fair, Dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying, ere My heart \
repented of its love for thee. If buried in oblivion I should be, Bereft of \
life, fame, favour, even there It would be found that I thy image bear Deep \
graven in my breast for all to see. This like some holy relic do I prize To \
save me from the fate my truth entails, Truth that to thy hard heart its \
vigour owes. Alas for him that under lowering skies, In peril o'er a \
trackless ocean sails, Where neither friendly port nor pole-star shows.\" \
Anselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he had praised the first; and so \
he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he was binding \
himself and making his dishonour secure; for when Lothario was doing most to \
dishonour him he told him he was most honoured; and thus each step that \
Camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement, she mounted, in his \
opinion, towards the summit of virtue and fair fame. It so happened that \
finding herself on one occasion alone with her maid, Camilla said to her, \"I \
am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, how lightly I have valued myself that I \
did not compel Lothario to purchase by at least some expenditure of time that \
full possession of me that I so quickly yielded him of my own free will. I \
fear that he will think ill of my pliancy or lightness, not considering the \
irresistible influence he brought to bear upon me.\" \"Let not that trouble \
you, my lady,\" said Leonela, \"for it does not take away the value of the \
thing given or make it the less precious to give it quickly if it be really \
valuable and worthy of being prized; nay, they are wont to say that he who \
gives quickly gives twice.\" \"They say also,\" said Camilla, \"that what \
costs little is valued less.\" \"That saying does not hold good in your case,\
\" replied Leonela, \"for love, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and \
sometimes walks; with this one it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it \
cools, others it burns; some it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course \
of its desires, and at the same moment completes and ends it; in the morning \
it will lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, for there is \
no power that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, what do you fear, \
when the same must have befallen Lothario, love having chosen the absence of \
my lord as the instrument for subduing you? and it was absolutely necessary \
to complete then what love had resolved upon, without affording the time to \
let Anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be left unfinished; \
for love has no better agent for carrying out his designs than opportunity; \
and of opportunity he avails himself in all his feats, especially at the \
outset. All this I know well myself, more by experience than by hearsay, and \
some day, senora, I will enlighten you on the subject, for I am of your flesh \
and blood too. Moreover, lady Camilla, you did not surrender yourself or \
yield so quickly but that first you saw Lothario's whole soul in his eyes, in \
his sighs, in his words, his promises and his gifts, and by it and his good \
qualities perceived how worthy he was of your love. This, then, being the \
case, let not these scrupulous and prudish ideas trouble your imagination, \
but be assured that Lothario prizes you as you do him, and rest content and \
satisfied that as you are caught in the noose of love it is one of worth and \
merit that has taken you, and one that has not only the four S's that they \
say true lovers ought to have, but a complete alphabet; only listen to me and \
you will see how I can repeat it by rote. He is to my eyes and thinking, \
Amiable, Brave, Courteous, Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay, Honourable, \
Illustrious, Loyal, Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted, Rich, and the \
S's according to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious: X does not suit him, \
for it is a rough letter; Y has been given already; and Z Zealous for your \
honour.\" Camilla laughed at her maid's alphabet, and perceived her to be \
more experienced in love affairs than she said, which she admitted, \
confessing to Camilla that she had love passages with a young man of good \
birth of the same city. Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest it might \
prove the means of endangering her honour, and asked whether her intrigue had \
gone beyond words, and she with little shame and much effrontery said it had; \
for certain it is that ladies' imprudences make servants shameless, who, when \
they see their mistresses make a false step, think nothing of going astray \
themselves, or of its being known. All that Camilla could do was to entreat \
Leonela to say nothing about her doings to him whom she called her lover, and \
to conduct her own affairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of \
Anselmo or of Lothario. Leonela said she would, but kept her word in such a \
way that she confirmed Camilla's apprehension of losing her reputation \
through her means; for this abandoned and bold Leonela, as soon as she \
perceived that her mistress's demeanour was not what it was wont to be, had \
the audacity to introduce her lover into the house, confident that even if \
her mistress saw him she would not dare to expose him; for the sins of \
mistresses entail this mischief among others; they make themselves the slaves \
of their own servants, and are obliged to hide their laxities and \
depravities; as was the case with Camilla, who though she perceived, not once \
but many times, that Leonela was with her lover in some room of the house, \
not only did not dare to chide her, but afforded her opportunities for \
concealing him and removed all difficulties, lest he should be seen by her \
husband. She was unable, however, to prevent him from being seen on one \
occasion, as he sallied forth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who \
he was, at first took him for a spectre; but, as soon as he saw him hasten \
away, muffling his face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and \
cautiously, he rejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, which would \
have been the ruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy. It did not occur to \
Lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such an untimely hour from \
Anselmo's house could have entered it on Leonela's account, nor did he even \
remember there was such a person as Leonela; all he thought was that as \
Camilla had been light and yielding with him, so she had been with another; \
for this further penalty the erring woman's sin brings with it, that her \
honour is distrusted even by him to whose overtures and persuasions she has \
yielded; and he believes her to have surrendered more easily to others, and \
gives implicit credence to every suspicion that comes into his mind. All \
Lothario's good sense seems to have failed him at this juncture; all his \
prudent maxims escaped his memory; for without once reflecting rationally, \
and without more ado, in his impatience and in the blindness of the jealous \
rage that gnawed his heart, and dying to revenge himself upon Camilla, who \
had done him no wrong, before Anselmo had risen he hastened to him and said \
to him, \"Know, Anselmo, that for several days past I have been struggling \
with myself, striving to withhold from thee what it is no longer possible or \
right that I should conceal from thee. Know that Camilla's fortress has \
surrendered and is ready to submit to my will; and if I have been slow to \
reveal this fact to thee, it was in order to see if it were some light \
caprice of hers, or if she sought to try me and ascertain if the love I began \
to make to her with thy permission was made with a serious intention. I \
thought, too, that she, if she were what she ought to be, and what we both \
believed her, would have ere this given thee information of my addresses; but \
seeing that she delays, I believe the truth of the promise she has given me \
that the next time thou art absent from the house she will grant me an \
interview in the closet where thy jewels are kept (and it was true that \
Camilla used to meet him there); but I do not wish thee to rush precipitately \
to take vengeance, for the sin is as yet only committed in intention, and \
Camilla's may change perhaps between this and the appointed time, and \
repentance spring up in its place. As hitherto thou hast always followed my \
advice wholly or in part, follow and observe this that I will give thee now, \
so that, without mistake, and with mature deliberation, thou mayest satisfy \
thyself as to what may seem the best course; pretend to absent thyself for \
two or three days as thou hast been wont to do on other occasions, and \
contrive to hide thyself in the closet; for the tapestries and other things \
there afford great facilities for thy concealment, and then thou wilt see \
with thine own eyes and I with mine what Camilla's purpose may be. And if it \
be a guilty one, which may be feared rather than expected, with silence, \
prudence, and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of \
punishment for the wrong done thee.\" Anselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and \
astounded at the words of Lothario, which came upon him at a time when he \
least expected to hear them, for he now looked upon Camilla as having \
triumphed over the pretended attacks of Lothario, and was beginning to enjoy \
the glory of her victory. He remained silent for a considerable time, looking \
on the ground with fixed gaze, and at length said, \"Thou hast behaved, \
Lothario, as I expected of thy friendship: I will follow thy advice in \
everything; do as thou wilt, and keep this secret as thou seest it should be \
kept in circumstances so unlooked for.\" Lothario gave him his word, but \
after leaving him he repented altogether of what he had said to him, \
perceiving how foolishly he had acted, as he might have revenged himself upon \
Camilla in some less cruel and degrading way. He cursed his want of sense, \
condemned his hasty resolution, and knew not what course to take to undo the \
mischief or find some ready escape from it. At last he decided upon revealing \
all to Camilla, and, as there was no want of opportunity for doing so, he \
found her alone the same day; but she, as soon as she had the chance of \
speaking to him, said, \"Lothario my friend, I must tell thee I have a sorrow \
in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready to burst; and it will be a \
wonder if it does not; for the audacity of Leonela has now reached such a \
pitch that every night she conceals a gallant of hers in this house and \
remains with him till morning, at the expense of my reputation; inasmuch as \
it is open to anyone to question it who may see him quitting my house at such \
unseasonable hours; but what distresses me is that I cannot punish or chide \
her, for her privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent \
about hers, while I am dreading that some catastrophe will come of it.\" As \
Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device to delude him \
into the idea that the man he had seen going out was Leonela's lover and not \
hers; but when he saw how she wept and suffered, and begged him to help her, \
he became convinced of the truth, and the conviction completed his confusion \
and remorse; however, he told Camilla not to distress herself, as he would \
take measures to put a stop to the insolence of Leonela. At the same time he \
told her what, driven by the fierce rage of jealousy, he had said to Anselmo, \
and how he had arranged to hide himself in the closet that he might there see \
plainly how little she preserved her fidelity to him; and he entreated her \
pardon for this madness, and her advice as to how to repair it, and escape \
safely from the intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had involved him. \
Camilla was struck with alarm at hearing what Lothario said, and with much \
anger, and great good sense, she reproved him and rebuked his base design and \
the foolish and mischievous resolution he had made; but as woman has by \
nature a nimbler wit than man for good and for evil, though it is apt to fail \
when she sets herself deliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of the \
moment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable, \
and told Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should conceal \
himself in the place he mentioned, for she hoped from his concealment to \
obtain the means of their enjoying themselves for the future without any \
apprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely she charged \
him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed, to come to her when \
Leonela should call him, and to all she said to him to answer as he would \
have answered had he not known that Anselmo was listening. Lothario pressed \
her to explain her intention fully, so that he might with more certainty and \
precaution take care to do what he saw to be needful. \"I tell you,\" said \
Camilla, \"there is nothing to take care of except to answer me what I shall \
ask you;\" for she did not wish to explain to him beforehand what she meant \
to do, fearing lest he should be unwilling to follow out an idea which seemed \
to her such a good one, and should try or devise some other less practicable \
plan. Lothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo, under pretence of \
going to his friend's country house, took his departure, and then returned to \
conceal himself, which he was able to do easily, as Camilla and Leonela took \
care to give him the opportunity; and so he placed himself in hiding in the \
state of agitation that it may be imagined he would feel who expected to see \
the vitals of his honour laid bare before his eyes, and found himself on the \
point of losing the supreme blessing he thought he possessed in his beloved \
Camilla. Having made sure of Anselmo's being in his hiding-place, Camilla and \
Leonela entered the closet, and the instant she set foot within it Camilla \
said, with a deep sigh, \"Ah! dear Leonela, would it not be better, before I \
do what I am unwilling you should know lest you should seek to prevent it, \
that you should take Anselmo's dagger that I have asked of you and with it \
pierce this vile heart of mine? But no; there is no reason why I should \
suffer the punishment of another's fault. I will first know what it is that \
the bold licentious eyes of Lothario have seen in me that could have \
encouraged him to reveal to me a design so base as that which he has \
disclosed regardless of his friend and of my honour. Go to the window, \
Leonela, and call him, for no doubt he is in the street waiting to carry out \
his vile project; but mine, cruel it may be, but honourable, shall be carried \
out first.\" \"Ah, senora,\" said the crafty Leonela, who knew her part, \
\"what is it you want to do with this dagger? Can it be that you mean to take \
your own life, or Lothario's? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead to \
the loss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissemble your \
wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the house now and \
finding us alone; consider, senora, we are weak women and he is a man, and \
determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose, blind and urged by \
passion, perhaps before you can put yours into execution he may do what will \
be worse for you than taking your life. Ill betide my master, Anselmo, for \
giving such authority in his house to this shameless fellow! And supposing \
you kill him, senora, as I suspect you mean to do, what shall we do with him \
when he is dead?\" \"What, my friend?\" replied Camilla, \"we shall leave him \
for Anselmo to bury him; for in reason it will be to him a light labour to \
hide his own infamy under ground. Summon him, make haste, for all the time I \
delay in taking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against the \
loyalty I owe my husband.\" Anselmo was listening to all this, and every word \
that Camilla uttered made him change his mind; but when he heard that it was \
resolved to kill Lothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself \
to avert such a disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of a resolution \
so bold and virtuous he restrained himself, intending to come forth in time \
to prevent the deed. At this moment Camilla, throwing herself upon a bed that \
was close by, swooned away, and Leonela began to weep bitterly, exclaiming, \
\"Woe is me! that I should be fated to have dying here in my arms the flower \
of virtue upon earth, the crown of true wives, the pattern of chastity!\" \
with more to the same effect, so that anyone who heard her would have taken \
her for the most tender-hearted and faithful handmaid in the world, and her \
mistress for another persecuted Penelope. Camilla was not long in recovering \
from her fainting fit and on coming to herself she said, \"Why do you not go, \
Leonela, to call hither that friend, the falsest to his friend the sun ever \
shone upon or night concealed? Away, run, haste, speed! lest the fire of my \
wrath burn itself out with delay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for \
melt away in menaces and maledictions.\" \"I am just going to call him, \
senora,\" said Leonela; \"but you must first give me that dagger, lest while \
I am gone you should by means of it give cause to all who love you to weep \
all their lives.\" \"Go in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so,\" said \
Camilla, \"for rash and foolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my \
honour, I am not going to be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed \
herself without having done anything wrong, and without having first killed \
him on whom the guilt of her misfortune lay. I shall die, if I am to die; but \
it must be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to weep over \
audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.\" Leonela required much \
pressing before she would go to summon Lothario, but at last she went, and \
while awaiting her return Camilla continued, as if speaking to herself, \
\"Good God! would it not have been more prudent to have repulsed Lothario, as \
I have done many a time before, than to allow him, as I am now doing, to \
think me unchaste and vile, even for the short time I must wait until I \
undeceive him? No doubt it would have been better; but I should not be \
avenged, nor the honour of my husband vindicated, should he find so clear and \
easy an escape from the strait into which his depravity has led him. Let the \
traitor pay with his life for the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the \
world know (if haply it shall ever come to know) that Camilla not only \
preserved her allegiance to her husband, but avenged him of the man who dared \
to wrong him. Still, I think it might be better to disclose this to Anselmo. \
But then I have called his attention to it in the letter I wrote to him in \
the country, and, if he did nothing to prevent the mischief I there pointed \
out to him, I suppose it was that from pure goodness of heart and \
trustfulness he would not and could not believe that any thought against his \
honour could harbour in the breast of so stanch a friend; nor indeed did I \
myself believe it for many days, nor should I have ever believed it if his \
insolence had not gone so far as to make it manifest by open presents, lavish \
promises, and ceaseless tears. But why do I argue thus? Does a bold \
determination stand in need of arguments? Surely not. Then traitors avaunt! \
Vengeance to my aid! Let the false one come, approach, advance, die, yield up \
his life, and then befall what may. Pure I came to him whom Heaven bestowed \
upon me, pure I shall leave him; and at the worst bathed in my own chaste \
blood and in the foul blood of the falsest friend that friendship ever saw in \
the world;\" and as she uttered these words she paced the room holding the \
unsheathed dagger, with such irregular and disordered steps, and such \
gestures that one would have supposed her to have lost her senses, and taken \
her for some violent desperado instead of a delicate woman. Anselmo, hidden \
behind some tapestries where he had concealed himself, beheld and was amazed \
at all, and already felt that what he had seen and heard was a sufficient \
answer to even greater suspicions; and he would have been now well pleased if \
the proof afforded by Lothario's coming were dispensed with, as he feared \
some sudden mishap; but as he was on the point of showing himself and coming \
forth to embrace and undeceive his wife he paused as he saw Leonela \
returning, leading Lothario. Camilla when she saw him, drawing a long line in \
front of her on the floor with the dagger, said to him, \"Lothario, pay \
attention to what I say to thee: if by any chance thou darest to cross this \
line thou seest, or even approach it, the instant I see thee attempt it that \
same instant will I pierce my bosom with this dagger that I hold in my hand; \
and before thou answerest me a word desire thee to listen to a few from me, \
and afterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee. First, I desire thee to \
tell me, Lothario, if thou knowest my husband Anselmo, and in what light thou \
regardest him; and secondly I desire to know if thou knowest me too. Answer \
me this, without embarrassment or reflecting deeply what thou wilt answer, \
for they are no riddles I put to thee.\" Lothario was not so dull but that \
from the first moment when Camilla directed him to make Anselmo hide himself \
he understood what she intended to do, and therefore he fell in with her idea \
so readily and promptly that between them they made the imposture look more \
true than truth; so he answered her thus: \"I did not think, fair Camilla, \
that thou wert calling me to ask questions so remote from the object with \
which I come; but if it is to defer the promised reward thou art doing so, \
thou mightst have put it off still longer, for the longing for happiness \
gives the more distress the nearer comes the hope of gaining it; but lest \
thou shouldst say that I do not answer thy questions, I say that I know thy \
husband Anselmo, and that we have known each other from our earliest years; I \
will not speak of what thou too knowest, of our friendship, that I may not \
compel myself to testify against the wrong that love, the mighty excuse for \
greater errors, makes me inflict upon him. Thee I know and hold in the same \
estimation as he does, for were it not so I had not for a lesser prize acted \
in opposition to what I owe to my station and the holy laws of true \
friendship, now broken and violated by me through that powerful enemy, \
love.\" \"If thou dost confess that,\" returned Camilla, \"mortal enemy of \
all that rightly deserves to be loved, with what face dost thou dare to come \
before one whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he is reflected on whom \
thou shouldst look to see how unworthily thou him? But, woe is me, I now \
comprehend what has made thee give so little heed to what thou owest to \
thyself; it must have been some freedom of mine, for I will not call it \
immodesty, as it did not proceed from any deliberate intention, but from some \
heedlessness such as women are guilty of through inadvertence when they think \
they have no occasion for reserve. But tell me, traitor, when did I by word \
or sign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken in thee a shadow of \
hope of attaining thy base wishes? When were not thy professions of love \
sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked? When were thy frequent pledges \
and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted? But as I am persuaded \
that no one can long persevere in the attempt to win love unsustained by some \
hope, I am willing to attribute to myself the blame of thy assurance, for no \
doubt some thoughtlessness of mine has all this time fostered thy hopes; and \
therefore will I punish myself and inflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt \
deserves. And that thou mayest see that being so relentless to myself I \
cannot possibly be otherwise to thee, I have summoned thee to be a witness of \
the sacrifice I mean to offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband, \
wronged by thee with all the assiduity thou wert capable of, and by me too \
through want of caution in avoiding every occasion, if I have given any, of \
encouraging and sanctioning thy base designs. Once more I say the suspicion \
in my mind that some imprudence of mine has engendered these lawless thoughts \
in thee, is what causes me most distress and what I desire most to punish \
with my own hands, for were any other instrument of punishment employed my \
error might become perhaps more widely known; but before I do so, in my death \
I mean to inflict death, and take with me one that will fully satisfy my \
longing for the revenge I hope for and have; for I shall see, wheresoever it \
may be that I go, the penalty awarded by inflexible, unswerving justice on \
him who has placed me in a position so desperate.\" As she uttered these \
words, with incredible energy and swiftness she flew upon Lothario with the \
naked dagger, so manifestly bent on burying it in his breast that he was \
almost uncertain whether these demonstrations were real or feigned, for he \
was obliged to have recourse to all his skill and strength to prevent her \
from striking him; and with such reality did she act this strange farce and \
mystification that, to give it a colour of truth, she determined to stain it \
with her own blood; for perceiving, or pretending, that she could not wound \
Lothario, she said, \"Fate, it seems, will not grant my just desire complete \
satisfaction, but it will not be able to keep me from satisfying it partially \
at least;\" and making an effort to free the hand with the dagger which \
Lothario held in his grasp, she released it, and directing the point to a \
place where it could not inflict a deep wound, she plunged it into her left \
side high up close to the shoulder, and then allowed herself to fall to the \
ground as if in a faint. Leonela and Lothario stood amazed and astounded at \
the catastrophe, and seeing Camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her \
blood they were still uncertain as to the true nature of the act. Lothario, \
terrified and breathless, ran in haste to pluck out the dagger; but when he \
saw how slight the wound was he was relieved of his fears and once more \
admired the subtlety, coolness, and ready wit of the fair Camilla; and the \
better to support the part he had to play he began to utter profuse and \
doleful lamentations over her body as if she were dead, invoking maledictions \
not only on himself but also on him who had been the means of placing him in \
such a position: and knowing that his friend Anselmo heard him he spoke in \
such a way as to make a listener feel much more pity for him than for \
Camilla, even though he supposed her dead. Leonela took her up in her arms \
and laid her on the bed, entreating Lothario to go in quest of some one to \
attend to her wound in secret, and at the same time asking his advice and \
opinion as to what they should say to Anselmo about his lady's wound if he \
should chance to return before it was healed. He replied they might say what \
they liked, for he was not in a state to give advice that would be of any \
use; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the blood, as he was going \
where he should never more be seen; and with every appearance of deep grief \
and sorrow he left the house; but when he found himself alone, and where \
there was nobody to see him, he crossed himself unceasingly, lost in wonder \
at the adroitness of Camilla and the consistent acting of Leonela. He \
reflected how convinced Anselmo would be that he had a second Portia for a \
wife, and he looked forward anxiously to meeting him in order to rejoice \
together over falsehood and truth the most craftily veiled that could be \
imagined. Leonela, as he told her, stanched her lady's blood, which was no \
more than sufficed to support her deception; and washing the wound with a \
little wine she bound it up to the best of her skill, talking all the time \
she was tending her in a strain that, even if nothing else had been said \
before, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he had in Camilla a \
model of purity. To Leonela's words Camilla added her own, calling herself \
cowardly and wanting in spirit, since she had not enough at the time she had \
most need of it to rid herself of the life she so much loathed. She asked her \
attendant's advice as to whether or not she ought to inform her beloved \
husband of all that had happened, but the other bade her say nothing about \
it, as she would lay upon him the obligation of taking vengeance on Lothario, \
which he could not do but at great risk to himself; and it was the duty of a \
true wife not to give her husband provocation to quarrel, but, on the \
contrary, to remove it as far as possible from him. Camilla replied that she \
believed she was right and that she would follow her advice, but at any rate \
it would be well to consider how she was to explain the wound to Anselmo, for \
he could not help seeing it; to which Leonela answered that she did not know \
how to tell a lie even in jest. \"How then can I know, my dear?\" said \
Camilla, \"for I should not dare to forge or keep up a falsehood if my life \
depended on it. If we can think of no escape from this difficulty, it will be \
better to tell him the plain truth than that he should find us out in an \
untrue story.\" \"Be not uneasy, senora,\" said Leonela; \"between this and \
to-morrow I will think of what we must say to him, and perhaps the wound \
being where it is it can be hidden from his sight, and Heaven will be pleased \
to aid us in a purpose so good and honourable. Compose yourself, senora, and \
endeavour to calm your excitement lest my lord find you agitated; and leave \
the rest to my care and God's, who always supports good intentions.\" Anselmo \
had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out the tragedy of \
the death of his honour, which the performers acted with such wonderfully \
effective truth that it seemed as if they had become the realities of the \
parts they played. He longed for night and an opportunity of escaping from \
the house to go and see his good friend Lothario, and with him give vent to \
his joy over the precious pearl he had gained in having established his \
wife's purity. Both mistress and maid took care to give him time and \
opportunity to get away, and taking advantage of it he made his escape, and \
at once went in quest of Lothario, and it would be impossible to describe how \
he embraced him when he found him, and the things he said to him in the joy \
of his heart, and the praises he bestowed upon Camilla; all which Lothario \
listened to without being able to show any pleasure, for he could not forget \
how deceived his friend was, and how dishonourably he had wronged him; and \
though Anselmo could see that Lothario was not glad, still he imagined it was \
only because he had left Camilla wounded and had been himself the cause of \
it; and so among other things he told him not to be distressed about \
Camilla's accident, for, as they had agreed to hide it from him, the wound \
was evidently trifling; and that being so, he had no cause for fear, but \
should henceforward be of good cheer and rejoice with him, seeing that by his \
means and adroitness he found himself raised to the greatest height of \
happiness that he could have ventured to hope for, and desired no better \
pastime than making verses in praise of Camilla that would preserve her name \
for all time to come. Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own \
part to aid him in raising a monument so glorious. And so Anselmo was left \
the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be in the world. He himself, \
persuaded he was conducting the instrument of his glory, led home by the hand \
him who had been the utter destruction of his good name; whom Camilla \
received with averted countenance, though with smiles in her heart. The \
deception was carried on for some time, until at the end of a few months \
Fortune turned her wheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully \
concealed was published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of \
his ill-advised curiosity. CHAPTER XXXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND \
PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH CERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS \
THE NOVEL OF \"THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\" TO A CLOSE There remained but \
little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho Panza burst forth in wild \
excitement from the garret where Don Quixote was lying, shouting, \"Run, \
sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in the thick of the toughest and \
stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By the living God he has given the \
giant, the enemy of my lady the Princess Micomicona, such a slash that he has \
sliced his head clean off as if it were a turnip.\" \"What are you talking \
about, brother?\" said the curate, pausing as he was about to read the \
remainder of the novel. \"Are you in your senses, Sancho? How the devil can \
it be as you say, when the giant is two thousand leagues away?\" Here they \
heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shouting out, \"Stand, \
thief, brigand, villain; now I have got thee, and thy scimitar shall not \
avail thee!\" And then it seemed as though he were slashing vigorously at the \
wall. \"Don't stop to listen,\" said Sancho, \"but go in and part them or \
help my master: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giant \
is dead by this time and giving account to God of his past wicked life; for I \
saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and fallen on one \
side, and it is as big as a large wine-skin.\" \"May I die,\" said the \
landlord at this, \"if Don Quixote or Don Devil has not been slashing some of \
the skins of red wine that stand full at his bed's head, and the spilt wine \
must be what this good fellow takes for blood;\" and so saying he went into \
the room and the rest after him, and there they found Don Quixote in the \
strangest costume in the world. He was in his shirt, which was not long \
enough in front to cover his thighs completely and was six fingers shorter \
behind; his legs were very long and lean, covered with hair, and anything but \
clean; on his head he had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, \
round his left arm he had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for \
reasons best known to himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he held \
his unsheathed sword, with which he was slashing about on all sides, uttering \
exclamations as if he were actually fighting some giant: and the best of it \
was his eyes were not open, for he was fast asleep, and dreaming that he was \
doing battle with the giant. For his imagination was so wrought upon by the \
adventure he was going to accomplish, that it made him dream he had already \
reached the kingdom of Micomicon, and was engaged in combat with his enemy; \
and believing he was laying on the giant, he had given so many sword cuts to \
the skins that the whole room was full of wine. On seeing this the landlord \
was so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, and with his clenched fist began \
to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenio and the curate had not dragged \
him off, he would have brought the war of the giant to an end. But in spite \
of all the poor gentleman never woke until the barber brought a great pot of \
cold water from the well and flung it with one dash all over his body, on \
which Don Quixote woke up, but not so completely as to understand what was \
the matter. Dorothea, seeing how short and slight his attire was, would not \
go in to witness the battle between her champion and her opponent. As for \
Sancho, he went searching all over the floor for the head of the giant, and \
not finding it he said, \"I see now that it's all enchantment in this house; \
for the last time, on this very spot where I am now, I got ever so many \
thumps without knowing who gave them to me, or being able to see anybody; and \
now this head is not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut off with \
my own eyes and the blood running from the body as if from a fountain.\" \
\"What blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and his \
saints?\" said the landlord. \"Don't you see, you thief, that the blood and \
the fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and the red \
wine swimming all over the room?--and I wish I saw the soul of him that \
stabbed them swimming in hell.\" \"I know nothing about that,\" said Sancho; \
\"all I know is it will be my bad luck that through not finding this head my \
county will melt away like salt in water;\"--for Sancho awake was worse than \
his master asleep, so much had his master's promises addled his wits. The \
landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and the mischievous \
doings of the master, and swore it should not be like the last time when they \
went without paying; and that their privileges of chivalry should not hold \
good this time to let one or other of them off without paying, even to the \
cost of the plugs that would have to be put to the damaged wine-skins. The \
curate was holding Don Quixote's hands, who, fancying he had now ended the \
adventure and was in the presence of the Princess Micomicona, knelt before \
the curate and said, \"Exalted and beauteous lady, your highness may live \
from this day forth fearless of any harm this base being could do you; and I \
too from this day forth am released from the promise I gave you, since by the \
help of God on high and by the favour of her by whom I live and breathe, I \
have fulfilled it so successfully.\" \"Did not I say so?\" said Sancho on \
hearing this. \"You see I wasn't drunk; there you see my master has already \
salted the giant; there's no doubt about the bulls; my county is all right!\" \
Who could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master and \
man? And laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed himself; but at \
length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrived with no small trouble \
to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep with every appearance of \
excessive weariness. They left him to sleep, and came out to the gate of the \
inn to console Sancho Panza on not having found the head of the giant; but \
much more work had they to appease the landlord, who was furious at the \
sudden death of his wine-skins; and said the landlady half scolding, half \
crying, \"At an evil moment and in an unlucky hour he came into my house, \
this knight-errant--would that I had never set eyes on him, for dear he has \
cost me; the last time he went off with the overnight score against him for \
supper, bed, straw, and barley, for himself and his squire and a hack and an \
ass, saying he was a knight adventurer--God send unlucky adventures to him \
and all the adventurers in the world--and therefore not bound to pay \
anything, for it was so settled by the knight-errantry tariff: and then, all \
because of him, came the other gentleman and carried off my tail, and gives \
it back more than two cuartillos the worse, all stripped of its hair, so that \
it is no use for my husband's purpose; and then, for a finishing touch to \
all, to burst my wine-skins and spill my wine! I wish I saw his own blood \
spilt! But let him not deceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and \
the shade of my mother, they shall pay me down every quarts; or my name is \
not what it is, and I am not my father's daughter.\" All this and more to the \
same effect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maid \
Maritornes backed her up, while the daughter held her peace and smiled from \
time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to make good all \
losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the wine-skins but also \
the wine, and above all the depreciation of the tail which they set such \
store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling him that she pledged herself, as \
soon as it should appear certain that his master had decapitated the giant, \
and she found herself peacefully established in her kingdom, to bestow upon \
him the best county there was in it. With this Sancho consoled himself, and \
assured the princess she might rely upon it that he had seen the head of the \
giant, and more by token it had a beard that reached to the girdle, and that \
if it was not to be seen now it was because everything that happened in that \
house went by enchantment, as he himself had proved the last time he had \
lodged there. Dorothea said she fully believed it, and that he need not be \
uneasy, for all would go well and turn out as he wished. All therefore being \
appeased, the curate was anxious to go on with the novel, as he saw there was \
but little more left to read. Dorothea and the others begged him to finish \
it, and he, as he was willing to please them, and enjoyed reading it himself, \
continued the tale in these words: The result was, that from the confidence \
Anselmo felt in Camilla's virtue, he lived happy and free from anxiety, and \
Camilla purposely looked coldly on Lothario, that Anselmo might suppose her \
feelings towards him to be the opposite of what they were; and the better to \
support the position, Lothario begged to be excused from coming to the house, \
as the displeasure with which Camilla regarded his presence was plain to be \
seen. But the befooled Anselmo said he would on no account allow such a \
thing, and so in a thousand ways he became the author of his own dishonour, \
while he believed he was insuring his happiness. Meanwhile the satisfaction \
with which Leonela saw herself empowered to carry on her amour reached such a \
height that, regardless of everything else, she followed her inclinations \
unrestrainedly, feeling confident that her mistress would screen her, and \
even show her how to manage it safely. At last one night Anselmo heard \
footsteps in Leonela's room, and on trying to enter to see who it was, he \
found that the door was held against him, which made him all the more \
determined to open it; and exerting his strength he forced it open, and \
entered the room in time to see a man leaping through the window into the \
street. He ran quickly to seize him or discover who he was, but he was unable \
to effect either purpose, for Leonela flung her arms round him crying, \"Be \
calm, senor; do not give way to passion or follow him who has escaped from \
this; he belongs to me, and in fact he is my husband.\" Anselmo would not \
believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger and threatened to stab Leonela, \
bidding her tell the truth or he would kill her. She, in her fear, not \
knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, \"Do not kill me, senor, for I can \
tell you things more important than any you can imagine.\" \"Tell me then at \
once or thou diest,\" said Anselmo. \"It would be impossible for me now,\" \
said Leonela, \"I am so agitated: leave me till to-morrow, and then you shall \
hear from me what will fill you with astonishment; but rest assured that he \
who leaped through the window is a young man of this city, who has given me \
his promise to become my husband.\" Anselmo was appeased with this, and was \
content to wait the time she asked of him, for he never expected to hear \
anything against Camilla, so satisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so \
he quitted the room, and left Leonela locked in, telling her she should not \
come out until she had told him all she had to make known to him. He went at \
once to see Camilla, and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him \
and her handmaid, and the promise she had given him to inform him matters of \
serious importance. There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated \
or not, for so great was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had \
good reason to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her \
faithlessness, she had not the courage to wait and see if her suspicions were \
confirmed; and that same night, as soon as she thought that Anselmo was \
asleep, she packed up the most valuable jewels she had and some money, and \
without being observed by anybody escaped from the house and betook herself \
to Lothario's, to whom she related what had occurred, imploring him to convey \
her to some place of safety or fly with her where they might be safe from \
Anselmo. The state of perplexity to which Camilla reduced Lothario was such \
that he was unable to utter a word in reply, still less to decide upon what \
he should do. At length he resolved to conduct her to a convent of which a \
sister of his was prioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with the speed which \
the circumstances demanded, Lothario took her to the convent and left her \
there, and then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know of his \
departure. As soon as daylight came Anselmo, without missing Camilla from his \
side, rose cager to learn what Leonela had to tell him, and hastened to the \
room where he had locked her in. He opened the door, entered, but found no \
Leonela; all he found was some sheets knotted to the window, a plain proof \
that she had let herself down from it and escaped. He returned, uneasy, to \
tell Camilla, but not finding her in bed or anywhere in the house he was lost \
in amazement. He asked the servants of the house about her, but none of them \
could give him any explanation. As he was going in search of Camilla it \
happened by chance that he observed her boxes were lying open, and that the \
greater part of her jewels were gone; and now he became fully aware of his \
disgrace, and that Leonela was not the cause of his misfortune; and, just as \
he was, without delaying to dress himself completely, he repaired, sad at \
heart and dejected, to his friend Lothario to make known his sorrow to him; \
but when he failed to find him and the servants reported that he had been \
absent from his house all night and had taken with him all the money he had, \
he felt as though he were losing his senses; and to make all complete on \
returning to his own house he found it deserted and empty, not one of all his \
servants, male or female, remaining in it. He knew not what to think, or say, \
or do, and his reason seemed to be deserting him little by little. He \
reviewed his position, and saw himself in a moment left without wife, friend, \
or servants, abandoned, he felt, by the heaven above him, and more than all \
robbed of his honour, for in Camilla's disappearance he saw his own ruin. \
After long reflection he resolved at last to go to his friend's village, \
where he had been staying when he afforded opportunities for the contrivance \
of this complication of misfortune. He locked the doors of his house, mounted \
his horse, and with a broken spirit set out on his journey; but he had hardly \
gone half-way when, harassed by his reflections, he had to dismount and tie \
his horse to a tree, at the foot of which he threw himself, giving vent to \
piteous heartrending sighs; and there he remained till nearly nightfall, when \
he observed a man approaching on horseback from the city, of whom, after \
saluting him, he asked what was the news in Florence. The citizen replied, \
\"The strangest that have been heard for many a day; for it is reported \
abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the wealthy Anselmo, who lived at \
San Giovanni, carried off last night Camilla, the wife of Anselmo, who also \
has disappeared. All this has been told by a maid-servant of Camilla's, whom \
the governor found last night lowering herself by a sheet from the windows of \
Anselmo's house. I know not indeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; \
all I know is that the whole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no one \
could have expected a thing of the kind, seeing the great and intimate \
friendship that existed between them, so great, they say, that they were \
called 'The Two Friends.'\" \"Is it known at all,\" said Anselmo, \"what road \
Lothario and Camilla took?\" \"Not in the least,\" said the citizen, \"though \
the governor has been very active in searching for them.\" \"God speed you, \
senor,\" said Anselmo. \"God be with you,\" said the citizen and went his \
way. This disastrous intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of his \
senses but of his life. He got up as well as he was able and reached the \
house of his friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, but seeing \
him come pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he was suffering some heavy \
affliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowed to retire to rest, and to be \
given writing materials. His wish was complied with and he was left lying \
down and alone, for he desired this, and even that the door should be locked. \
Finding himself alone he so took to heart the thought of his misfortune that \
by the signs of death he felt within him he knew well his life was drawing to \
a close, and therefore he resolved to leave behind him a declaration of the \
cause of his strange end. He began to write, but before he had put down all \
he meant to say, his breath failed him and he yielded up his life, a victim \
to the suffering which his ill-advised curiosity had entailed upon him. The \
master of the house observing that it was now late and that Anselmo did not \
call, determined to go in and ascertain if his indisposition was increasing, \
and found him lying on his face, his body partly in the bed, partly on the \
writing-table, on which he lay with the written paper open and the pen still \
in his hand. Having first called to him without receiving any answer, his \
host approached him, and taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and \
saw that he was dead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the \
household to witness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he \
read the paper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which \
contained these words: \"A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of \
life. If the news of my death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know \
that I forgive her, for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to \
have required her to perform them; and since I have been the author of my own \
dishonour, there is no reason why-\" So far Anselmo had written, and thus it \
was plain that at this point, before he could finish what he had to say, his \
life came to an end. The next day his friend sent intelligence of his death \
to his relatives, who had already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the \
convent where Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on \
that inevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death, but \
because of those she received of her lover's departure. Although she saw \
herself a widow, it is said she refused either to quit the convent or take \
the veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence reached her that Lothario \
had been killed in a battle in which M. de Lautrec had been recently engaged \
with the Great Captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova in the kingdom of Naples, \
whither her too late repentant lover had repaired. On learning this Camilla \
took the veil, and shortly afterwards died, worn out by grief and melancholy. \
This was the end of all three, an end that came of a thoughtless beginning. \
\"I like this novel,\" said the curate; \"but I cannot persuade myself of its \
truth; and if it has been invented, the author's invention is faulty, for it \
is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as to try such a costly \
experiment as Anselmo's. If it had been represented as occurring between a \
gallant and his mistress it might pass; but between husband and wife there is \
something of an impossibility about it. As to the way in which the story is \
told, however, I have no fault to find.\" CHAPTER XXXVI. WHICH TREATS OF MORE \
CURIOUS INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED AT THE INN Just at that instant the landlord, \
who was standing at the gate of the inn, exclaimed, \"Here comes a fine troop \
of guests; if they stop here we may say gaudeamus.\" \"What are they?\" said \
Cardenio. \"Four men,\" said the landlord, \"riding a la jineta, with lances \
and bucklers, and all with black veils, and with them there is a woman in \
white on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two attendants on \
foot.\" \"Are they very near?\" said the curate. \"So near,\" answered the \
landlord, \"that here they come.\" Hearing this Dorothea covered her face, \
and Cardenio retreated into Don Quixote's room, and they hardly had time to \
do so before the whole party the host had described entered the inn, and the \
four that were on horseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, \
dismounted, and came forward to take down the woman who rode on the \
side-saddle, and one of them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair \
that stood at the entrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself. All \
this time neither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word, only \
on sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let her arms fall \
like one that was ill and weak. The attendants on foot then led the horses \
away to the stable. Observing this the curate, curious to know who these \
people in such a dress and preserving such silence were, went to where the \
servants were standing and put the question to one of them, who answered him. \
\"Faith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to be \
people of distinction, particularly he who advanced to take the lady you saw \
in his arms; and I say so because all the rest show him respect, and nothing \
is done except what he directs and orders.\" \"And the lady, who is she?\" \
asked the curate. \"That I cannot tell you either,\" said the servant, \"for \
I have not seen her face all the way: I have indeed heard her sigh many times \
and utter such groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time; \
but it is no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as my \
comrade and I have only been in their company two days, for having met us on \
the road they begged and persuaded us to accompany them to Andalusia, \
promising to pay us well.\" \"And have you heard any of them called by his \
name?\" asked the curate. \"No, indeed,\" replied the servant; \"they all \
preserve a marvellous silence on the road, for not a sound is to be heard \
among them except the poor lady's sighs and sobs, which make us pity her; and \
we feel sure that wherever it is she is going, it is against her will, and as \
far as one can judge from her dress she is a nun or, what is more likely, \
about to become one; and perhaps it is because taking the vows is not of her \
own free will, that she is so unhappy as she seems to be.\" \"That may well \
be,\" said the curate, and leaving them he returned to where Dorothea was, \
who, hearing the veiled lady sigh, moved by natural compassion drew near to \
her and said, \"What are you suffering from, senora? If it be anything that \
women are accustomed and know how to relieve, I offer you my services with \
all my heart.\" To this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea \
repeated her offers more earnestly she still kept silence, until the \
gentleman with the veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest, \
approached and said to Dorothea, \"Do not give yourself the trouble, senora, \
of making any offers to that woman, for it is her way to give no thanks for \
anything that is done for her; and do not try to make her answer unless you \
want to hear some lie from her lips.\" \"I have never told a lie,\" was the \
immediate reply of her who had been silent until now; \"on the contrary, it \
is because I am so truthful and so ignorant of lying devices that I am now in \
this miserable condition; and this I call you yourself to witness, for it is \
my unstained truth that has made you false and a liar.\" Cardenio heard these \
words clearly and distinctly, being quite close to the speaker, for there was \
only the door of Don Quixote's room between them, and the instant he did so, \
uttering a loud exclamation he cried, \"Good God! what is this I hear? What \
voice is this that has reached my ears?\" Startled at the voice the lady \
turned her head; and not seeing the speaker she stood up and attempted to \
enter the room; observing which the gentleman held her back, preventing her \
from moving a step. In her agitation and sudden movement the silk with which \
she had covered her face fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable \
and marvellous beauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning her eyes, \
everywhere she could direct her gaze, with an eagerness that made her look as \
if she had lost her senses, and so marked that it excited the pity of \
Dorothea and all who beheld her, though they knew not what caused it. The \
gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully occupied \
with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to his veil which was \
falling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who was holding the \
lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw that he who likewise held her was her \
husband, Don Fernando. The instant she recognised him, with a prolonged \
plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her heart, she fell backwards \
fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she \
would have fallen completely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to \
uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he \
it was who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if \
death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, \
for it was she that was struggling to release herself from his hold, having \
recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised her. Cardenio also \
heard Dorothea's cry as she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from \
his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw \
was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio \
at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent \
amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them. They gazed at one \
another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, Don Fernando at Cardenio, \
Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio. The first to break silence \
was Luscinda, who thus addressed Don Fernando: \"Leave me, Senor Don \
Fernando, for the sake of what you owe to yourself; if no other reason will \
induce you, leave me to cling to the wall of which I am the ivy, to the \
support from which neither your importunities, nor your threats, nor your \
promises, nor your gifts have been able to detach me. See how Heaven, by ways \
strange and hidden from our sight, has brought me face to face with my true \
husband; and well you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be \
able to efface him from my memory. May this plain declaration, then, lead \
you, as you can do nothing else, to turn your love into rage, your affection \
into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it up in the presence \
of my beloved husband I count it well bestowed; it may be by my death he will \
be convinced that I kept my faith to him to the last moment of life.\" \
Meanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda's words, by \
means of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando did not \
yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as well as she \
could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of bright and touching \
tears addressed him thus: \"If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou \
holdest eclipsed in thine arms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight \
thou wouldst have seen by this time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so \
long as thou wilt have it so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that \
lowly peasant girl whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst \
raise high enough to call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion of \
innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thy importunity, and thy \
true and tender passion, as it seemed, she opened the gates of her modesty \
and surrendered to thee the keys of her liberty; a gift received by thee but \
thanklessly, as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place where thou \
dost find me, and by thy appearance under the circumstances in which I see \
thee. Nevertheless, I would not have thee suppose that I have come here \
driven by my shame; it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by \
thee that have led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and thou didst so \
follow thy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou canst not help \
being mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable affection I bear thee \
may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou wouldst desert \
me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda's because thou art mine, nor can she \
be thine because she is Cardenio's; and it will be easier, remember, to bend \
thy will to love one who adores thee, than to lead one to love thee who \
abhors thee now. Thou didst address thyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay \
siege to my virtue, thou wert not ignorant of my station, well dost thou know \
how I yielded wholly to thy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to \
plead deception, and if it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as \
thou art a gentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as \
happy at last as thou didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I \
am, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave, for \
so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do not by \
deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the streets; make \
not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal services they as \
faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not deserving of such a return; \
and if thou thinkest it will debase thy blood to mingle it with mine, reflect \
that there is little or no nobility in the world that has not travelled the \
same road, and that in illustrious lineages it is not the woman's blood that \
is of account; and, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if \
thou art wanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou owest me, then \
even I have higher claims to nobility than thine. To make an end, senor, \
these are my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thy \
wife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to be false, if thou \
dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me; witness the \
pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, which thou thyself didst \
call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and if all this fail, thy own \
conscience will not fail to lift up its silent voice in the midst of all thy \
gaiety, and vindicate the truth of what I say and mar thy highest pleasure \
and enjoyment.\" All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such \
earnest feeling and such tears that all present, even those who came with Don \
Fernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened to her \
without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such sobs and \
sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not softened by the \
sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her with no less \
compassion for her sufferings than admiration for her intelligence and \
beauty, and would have gone to her to say some words of comfort to her, but \
was prevented by Don Fernando's grasp which held her fast. He, overwhelmed \
with confusion and astonishment, after regarding Dorothea for some moments \
with a fixed gaze, opened his arms, and, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed: \
\"Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is \
impossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many truths.\" \
Luscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground when Don \
Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having retreated behind \
Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside and regardless of what \
might happen, ran forward to support her, and said as he clasped her in his \
arms, \"If Heaven in its compassion is willing to let thee rest at last, \
mistress of my heart, true, constant, and fair, nowhere canst thou rest more \
safely than in these arms that now receive thee, and received thee before \
when fortune permitted me to call thee mine.\" At these words Luscinda looked \
up at Cardenio, at first beginning to recognise him by his voice and then \
satisfying herself by her eyes that it was he, and hardly knowing what she \
did, and heedless of all considerations of decorum, she flung her arms around \
his neck and pressing her face close to his, said, \"Yes, my dear lord, you \
are the true master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose \
again, and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.\" A strange \
sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around, filled with \
surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied that Don Fernando \
changed colour and looked as though he meant to take vengeance on Cardenio, \
for she observed him put his hand to his sword; and the instant the idea \
struck her, with wonderful quickness she clasped him round the knees, and \
kissing them and holding him so as to prevent his moving, she said, while her \
tears continued to flow, \"What is it thou wouldst do, my only refuge, in \
this unforeseen event? Thou hast thy wife at thy feet, and she whom thou \
wouldst have for thy wife is in the arms of her husband: reflect whether it \
will be right for thee, whether it will be possible for thee to undo what \
Heaven has done, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her \
to be thy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her truth and \
constancy, is before thine eyes, bathing with the tears of love the face and \
bosom of her lawful husband. For God's sake I entreat of thee, for thine own \
I implore thee, let not this open manifestation rouse thy anger; but rather \
so calm it as to allow these two lovers to live in peace and quiet without \
any interference from thee so long as Heaven permits them; and in so doing \
thou wilt prove the generosity of thy lofty noble spirit, and the world shall \
see that with thee reason has more influence than passion.\" All the time \
Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda in his arms, never \
took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he saw him make any hostile \
movement, to try and defend himself and resist as best he could all who might \
assail him, though it should cost him his life. But now Don Fernando's \
friends, as well as the curate and the barber, who had been present all the \
while, not forgetting the worthy Sancho Panza, ran forward and gathered round \
Don Fernando, entreating him to have regard for the tears of Dorothea, and \
not suffer her reasonable hopes to be disappointed, since, as they firmly \
believed, what she said was but the truth; and bidding him observe that it \
was not, as it might seem, by accident, but by a special disposition of \
Providence that they had all met in a place where no one could have expected \
a meeting. And the curate bade him remember that only death could part \
Luscinda from Cardenio; that even if some sword were to separate them they \
would think their death most happy; and that in a case that admitted of no \
remedy his wisest course was, by conquering and putting a constraint upon \
himself, to show a generous mind, and of his own accord suffer these two to \
enjoy the happiness Heaven had granted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes \
upon the beauty of Dorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much \
less excel her; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the \
surpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him that if \
he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he could not do \
otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing so he would obey God \
and meet the approval of all sensible people, who know and recognised it to \
be the privilege of beauty, even in one of humble birth, provided virtue \
accompany it, to be able to raise itself to the level of any rank, without \
any slur upon him who places it upon an equality with himself; and \
furthermore that when the potent sway of passion asserts itself, so long as \
there be no mixture of sin in it, he is not to be blamed who gives way to it. \
To be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don \
Fernando's manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, was \
touched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he could not \
gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the good advice that \
had been offered to him, by stooping down and embracing Dorothea, saying to \
her, \"Rise, dear lady, it is not right that what I hold in my heart should \
be kneeling at my feet; and if until now I have shown no sign of what I own, \
it may have been by Heaven's decree in order that, seeing the constancy with \
which you love me, I may learn to value you as you deserve. What I entreat of \
you is that you reproach me not with my transgression and grievous \
wrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make you mine \
impelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this, turn and look \
at the eyes of the now happy Luscinda, and you will see in them an excuse for \
all my errors: and as she has found and gained the object of her desires, and \
I have found in you what satisfies all my wishes, may she live in peace and \
contentment as many happy years with her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray \
Heaven to allow me to live with my Dorothea;\" and with these words he once \
more embraced her and pressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that \
he had to take great heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his \
love and repentance in the sight of all. Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and \
almost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own \
happiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a heavy \
calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though \
afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was not as he \
fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great favours. Their \
wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio and \
Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him \
thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language so grateful that he \
knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced them with every \
mark of affection and courtesy. He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to \
reach a place so far removed from her own home, and she in a few fitting \
words told all that she had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don \
Fernando and his companions were so delighted that they wished the story had \
been longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she \
had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after \
he had found in Luscinda's bosom the paper in which she declared that she was \
Cardenio's wife, and never could be his. He said he meant to kill her, and \
would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents, and that he \
quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to avenge himself when \
a more convenient opportunity should offer. The next day he learned that \
Luscinda had disappeared from her father's house, and that no one could tell \
whither she had gone. Finally, at the end of some months he ascertained that \
she was in a convent and meant to remain there all the rest of her life, if \
she were not to share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this, \
taking these three gentlemen as his companions, he arrived at the place where \
she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing that if it were known he was \
there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent; and watching a time \
when the porter's lodge was open he left two to guard the gate, and he and \
the other entered the convent in quest of Luscinda, whom they found in the \
cloisters in conversation with one of the nuns, and carrying her off without \
giving her time to resist, they reached a place with her where they provided \
themselves with what they required for taking her away; all which they were \
able to do in complete safety, as the convent was in the country at a \
considerable distance from the city. He added that when Luscinda found \
herself in his power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to \
herself did nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in \
silence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was reaching heaven \
where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end. CHAPTER XXXVII. IN \
WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITH OTHER \
DROLL ADVENTURES To all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart \
to see how his hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and \
how the fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into \
Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious \
of all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself that \
her present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar state of \
mind, and Luscinda's thoughts ran in the same direction. Don Fernando gave \
thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for having been rescued from \
the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so near the destruction \
of his good name and of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full \
of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated and \
hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made sound reflections upon \
the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one \
that was in the highest spirits and good humour was the landlady, because of \
the promise Cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses \
and damage she had sustained through Don Quixote's means. Sancho, as has been \
already said, was the only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and \
so with a long face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to \
him: \"Sir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as \
you like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her \
kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now.\" \"I should \
think it was,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for I have had the most prodigious and \
stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember having had all the days \
of my life; and with one back-stroke-swish!--I brought his head tumbling to \
the ground, and so much blood gushed forth from him that it ran in rivulets \
over the earth like water.\" \"Like red wine, your worship had better say,\" \
replied Sancho; \"for I would have you know, if you don't know it, that the \
dead giant is a hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of \
red wine that it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that \
bore me; and the devil take it all.\" \"What art thou talking about, fool?\" \
said Don Quixote; \"art thou in thy senses?\" \"Let your worship get up,\" \
said Sancho, \"and you will see the nice business you have made of it, and \
what we have to pay; and you will see the queen turned into a private lady \
called Dorothea, and other things that will astonish you, if you understand \
them.\" \"I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,\" returned Don \
Quixote; \"for if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told thee \
that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it would \
be no wonder if it were the same now.\" \"I could believe all that,\" replied \
Sancho, \"if my blanketing was the same sort of thing also; only it wasn't, \
but real and genuine; for I saw the landlord, Who is here to-day, holding one \
end of the blanket and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, \
and with as much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of \
knowing people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is \
no enchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.\" \
\"Well, well, God will give a remedy,\" said Don Quixote; \"hand me my \
clothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and things \
thou speakest of.\" Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was \
dressing, the curate gave Don Fernando and the others present an account of \
Don Quixote's madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw \
him from that Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his \
lady's scorn. He described to them also nearly all the adventures that Sancho \
had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little, thinking it, \
as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be capable \
of. But now, the curate said, that the lady Dorothea's good fortune prevented \
her from proceeding with their purpose, it would be necessary to devise or \
discover some other way of getting him home. Cardenio proposed to carry out \
the scheme they had begun, and suggested that Luscinda would act and support \
Dorothea's part sufficiently well. \"No,\" said Don Fernando, \"that must not \
be, for I want Dorothea to follow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy \
gentleman's village is not very far off, I shall be happy if I can do \
anything for his relief.\" \"It is not more than two days' journey from this,\
\" said the curate. \"Even if it were more,\" said Don Fernando, \"I would \
gladly travel so far for the sake of doing so good a work. \"At this moment \
Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino's helmet, all dinted as \
it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and leaning on his staff or \
pike. The strange figure he presented filled Don Fernando and the rest with \
amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow face half a league long, his \
armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of his deportment. They stood silent \
waiting to see what he would say, and he, fixing his eyes on the air \
Dorothea, addressed her with great gravity and composure: \"I am informed, \
fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has been annihilated and \
your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady of high degree as you used \
to be, you have been turned into a private maiden. If this has been done by \
the command of the magician king your father, through fear that I should not \
afford you the aid you need and are entitled to, I may tell you he did not \
know and does not know half the mass, and was little versed in the annals of \
chivalry; for, if he had read and gone through them as attentively and \
deliberately as I have, he would have found at every turn that knights of \
less renown than mine have accomplished things more difficult: it is no great \
matter to kill a whelp of a giant, however arrogant he may be; for it is not \
many hours since I myself was engaged with one, and-I will not speak of it, \
that they may not say I am lying; time, however, that reveals all, will tell \
the tale when we least expect it.\" \"You were engaged with a couple of \
wine-skins, and not a giant,\" said the landlord at this; but Don Fernando \
told him to hold his tongue and on no account interrupt Don Quixote, who \
continued, \"I say in conclusion, high and disinherited lady, that if your \
father has brought about this metamorphosis in your person for the reason I \
have mentioned, you ought not to attach any importance to it; for there is no \
peril on earth through which my sword will not force a way, and with it, \
before many days are over, I will bring your enemy's head to the ground and \
place on yours the crown of your kingdom.\" Don Quixote said no more, and \
waited for the reply of the princess, who aware of Don Fernando's \
determination to carry on the deception until Don Quixote had been conveyed \
to his home, with great ease of manner and gravity made answer, \"Whoever \
told you, valiant Knight of the Rueful Countenance, that I had undergone any \
change or transformation did not tell you the truth, for I am the same as I \
was yesterday. It is true that certain strokes of good fortune, that have \
given me more than I could have hoped for, have made some alteration in me; \
but I have not therefore ceased to be what I was before, or to entertain the \
same desire I have had all through of availing myself of the might of your \
valiant and invincible arm. And so, senor, let your goodness reinstate the \
father that begot me in your good opinion, and be assured that he was a wise \
and prudent man, since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy way of \
remedying my misfortune; for I believe, senor, that had it not been for you I \
should never have lit upon the good fortune I now possess; and in this I am \
saying what is perfectly true; as most of these gentlemen who are present can \
fully testify. All that remains is to set out on our journey to-morrow, for \
to-day we could not make much way; and for the rest of the happy result I am \
looking forward to, I trust to God and the valour of your heart.\" So said \
the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her Don Quixote turned to Sancho, and \
said to him, with an angry air, \"I declare now, little Sancho, thou art the \
greatest little villain in Spain. Say, thief and vagabond, hast thou not just \
now told me that this princess had been turned into a maiden called Dorothea, \
and that the head which I am persuaded I cut off from a giant was the bitch \
that bore thee, and other nonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity I \
have ever been in all my life? I vow\" (and here he looked to heaven and \
ground his teeth) \"I have a mind to play the mischief with thee, in a way \
that will teach sense for the future to all lying squires of knights-errant \
in the world.\" \"Let your worship be calm, senor,\" returned Sancho, \"for \
it may well be that I have been mistaken as to the change of the lady \
princess Micomicona; but as to the giant's head, or at least as to the \
piercing of the wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, \
as sure as there is a God; because the wounded skins are there at the head of \
your worship's bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not you will \
see when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worship the landlord \
calls for all the damages: for the rest, I am heartily glad that her ladyship \
the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as much as anyone.\" \"I tell \
thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool,\" said Don Quixote; \"forgive me, and \
that will do.\" \"That will do,\" said Don Fernando; \"let us say no more \
about it; and as her ladyship the princess proposes to set out to-morrow \
because it is too late to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in \
pleasant conversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany Senor Don Quixote; \
for we wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is about \
to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he has undertaken.\" \
\"It is I who shall wait upon and accompany you,\" said Don Quixote; \"and I \
am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me, and the good \
opinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to justify or it shall cost \
me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more.\" Many were the \
compliments and expressions of politeness that passed between Don Quixote and \
Don Fernando; but they were brought to an end by a traveller who at this \
moment entered the inn, and who seemed from his attire to be a Christian \
lately come from the country of the Moors, for he was dressed in a \
short-skirted coat of blue cloth with half-sleeves and without a collar; his \
breeches were also of blue cloth, and his cap of the same colour, and he wore \
yellow buskins and had a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his \
breast. Behind him, mounted upon an ass, there came a woman dressed in \
Moorish fashion, with her face veiled and a scarf on her head, and wearing a \
little brocaded cap, and a mantle that covered her from her shoulders to her \
feet. The man was of a robust and well-proportioned frame, in age a little \
over forty, rather swarthy in complexion, with long moustaches and a full \
beard, and, in short, his appearance was such that if he had been well \
dressed he would have been taken for a person of quality and good birth. On \
entering he asked for a room, and when they told him there was none in the \
inn he seemed distressed, and approaching her who by her dress seemed to be a \
Moor he her down from saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, \
her daughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirely \
new costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly, \
courteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who had \
brought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, \"Do not be put \
out, senora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here, for it is the way \
of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you will be pleased to share \
our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda) perhaps you will have found worse \
accommodation in the course of your journey.\" To this the veiled lady made \
no reply; all she did was to rise from her seat, crossing her hands upon her \
bosom, bowing her head and bending her body as a sign that she returned \
thanks. From her silence they concluded that she must be a Moor and unable to \
speak a Christian tongue. At this moment the captive came up, having been \
until now otherwise engaged, and seeing that they all stood round his \
companion and that she made no reply to what they addressed to her, he said, \
\"Ladies, this damsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but \
that of her own country, for which reason she does not and cannot answer what \
has been asked of her.\" \"Nothing has been asked of her,\" returned \
Luscinda; \"she has only been offered our company for this evening and a \
share of the quarters we occupy, where she shall be made as comfortable as \
the circumstances allow, with the good-will we are bound to show all \
strangers that stand in need of it, especially if it be a woman to whom the \
service is rendered.\" \"On her part and my own, senora,\" replied the \
captive, \"I kiss your hands, and I esteem highly, as I ought, the favour you \
have offered, which, on such an occasion and coming from persons of your \
appearance, is, it is plain to see, a very great one.\" \"Tell me, senor,\" \
said Dorothea, \"is this lady a Christian or a Moor? for her dress and her \
silence lead us to imagine that she is what we could wish she was not.\" \"In \
dress and outwardly,\" said he, \"she is a Moor, but at heart she is a \
thoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become one.\" \
\"Then she has not been baptised?\" returned Luscinda. \"There has been no \
opportunity for that,\" replied the captive, \"since she left Algiers, her \
native country and home; and up to the present she has not found herself in \
any such imminent danger of death as to make it necessary to baptise her \
before she has been instructed in all the ceremonies our holy mother Church \
ordains; but, please God, ere long she shall be baptised with the solemnity \
befitting her which is higher than her dress or mine indicates.\" By these \
words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who the Moorish lady \
and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just then, seeing that it was a \
fitter moment for helping them to rest themselves than for questioning them \
about their lives. Dorothea took the Moorish lady by the hand and leading her \
to a seat beside herself, requested her to remove her veil. She looked at the \
captive as if to ask him what they meant and what she was to do. He said to \
her in Arabic that they asked her to take off her veil, and thereupon she \
removed it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she seemed \
more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful than Dorothea, \
and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it \
was the Moorish lady's, and there were even those who were inclined to give \
it somewhat the preference. And as it is the privilege and charm of beauty to \
win the heart and secure good-will, all forthwith became eager to show \
kindness and attention to the lovely Moor. Don Fernando asked the captive \
what her name was, and he replied that it was Lela Zoraida; but the instant \
she heard him, she guessed what the Christian had asked, and said hastily, \
with some displeasure and energy, \"No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!\" giving \
them to understand that she was called \"Maria\" and not \"Zoraida.\" These \
words, and the touching earnestness with which she uttered them, drew more \
than one tear from some of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by \
nature tender-hearted and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her \
affectionately, saying, \"Yes, yes, Maria, Maria,\" to which the Moor \
replied, \"Yes, yes, Maria; Zoraida macange,\" which means \"not Zoraida.\" \
Night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied Don \
Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the best \
supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having arrived they all took \
their seats at a long table like a refectory one, for round or square table \
there was none in the inn, and the seat of honour at the head of it, though \
he was for refusing it, they assigned to Don Quixote, who desired the lady \
Micomicona to place herself by his side, as he was her protector. Luscinda \
and Zoraida took their places next her, opposite to them were Don Fernando \
and Cardenio, and next the captive and the other gentlemen, and by the side \
of the ladies, the curate and the barber. And so they supped in high \
enjoyment, which was increased when they observed Don Quixote leave off \
eating, and, moved by an impulse like that which made him deliver himself at \
such length when he supped with the goatherds, begin to address them: \
\"Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the \
things they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry. Say, \
what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this castle at \
this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or imagine us to be \
what we are? Who would say that this lady who is beside me was the great \
queen that we all know her to be, or that I am that Knight of the Rueful \
Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of Fame? Now, there can be \
no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all those that mankind has \
invented, and is the more deserving of being held in honour in proportion as \
it is the more exposed to peril. Away with those who assert that letters have \
the preeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that they \
know not what they say. For the reason which such persons commonly assign, \
and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the labours of the mind are \
greater than those of the body, and that arms give employment to the body \
alone; as if the calling were a porter's trade, for which nothing more is \
required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we who profess them call \
arms, there were not included acts of vigour for the execution of which high \
intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of the warrior, when he has an \
army, or the defence of a city under his care, did not exert itself as much \
by mind as by body. Nay; see whether by bodily strength it be possible to \
learn or divine the intentions of the enemy, his plans, stratagems, or \
obstacles, or to ward off impending mischief; for all these are the work of \
the mind, and in them the body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms \
have need of the mind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two \
minds, that of the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and \
this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that \
purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object. The \
end and goal of letters--I am not speaking now of divine letters, the aim of \
which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end so infinite \
no other can be compared--I speak of human letters, the end of which is to \
establish distributive justice, give to every man that which is his, and see \
and take care that good laws are observed: an end undoubtedly noble, lofty, \
and deserving of high praise, but not such as should be given to that sought \
by arms, which have for their end and object peace, the greatest boon that \
men can desire in this life. The first good news the world and mankind \
received was that which the angels announced on the night that was our day, \
when they sang in the air, 'Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth \
to men of good-will;' and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and \
earth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any house, \
was to say, 'Peace be on this house;' and many other times he said to them, \
'My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace be with you;' a jewel \
and a precious gift given and left by such a hand: a jewel without which \
there can be no happiness either on earth or in heaven. This peace is the \
true end of war; and war is only another name for arms. This, then, being \
admitted, that the end of war is peace, and that so far it has the advantage \
of the end of letters, let us turn to the bodily labours of the man of \
letters, and those of him who follows the profession of arms, and see which \
are the greater.\" Don Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and \
in such correct language, that for the time being he made it impossible for \
any of his hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they were \
mostly gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they listened to \
him with great pleasure as he continued: \"Here, then, I say is what the \
student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all are poor, but to \
put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have said that he endures \
poverty, I think nothing more need be said about his hard fortune, for he who \
is poor has no share of the good things of life. This poverty he suffers from \
in various ways, hunger, or cold, or nakedness, or all together; but for all \
that it is not so extreme but that he gets something to eat, though it may be \
at somewhat unseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the \
greatest misery of the student is what they themselves call 'going out for \
soup,' and there is always some neighbour's brazier or hearth for them, \
which, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them, and lastly, \
they sleep comfortably at night under a roof. I will not go into other \
particulars, as for example want of shirts, and no superabundance of shoes, \
thin and threadbare garments, and gorging themselves to surfeit in their \
voracity when good luck has treated them to a banquet of some sort. By this \
road that I have described, rough and hard, stumbling here, falling there, \
getting up again to fall again, they reach the rank they desire, and that \
once attained, we have seen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and \
Charybdises, as if borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we have \
seen them, I say, ruling and governing the world from a chair, their hunger \
turned into satiety, their cold into comfort, their nakedness into fine \
raiment, their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask, the justly \
earned reward of their virtue; but, contrasted and compared with what the \
warrior undergoes, all they have undergone falls far short of it, as I am now \
about to show.\" CHAPTER XXXVIII. WHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON \
QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS AND LETTERS Continuing his discourse Don Quixote \
said: \"As we began in the student's case with poverty and its \
accompaniments, let us see now if the soldier is richer, and we shall find \
that in poverty itself there is no one poorer; for he is dependent on his \
miserable pay, which comes late or never, or else on what he can plunder, \
seriously imperilling his life and conscience; and sometimes his nakedness \
will be so great that a slashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and \
in the depth of winter he has to defend himself against the inclemency of the \
weather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his mouth, \
which I need not say, coming from an empty place, must come out cold, \
contrary to the laws of nature. To be sure he looks forward to the approach \
of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed that awaits him, \
which, unless by some fault of his, never sins by being over narrow, for he \
can easily measure out on the ground as he likes, and roll himself about in \
it to his heart's content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from \
him. Then, after all this, suppose the day and hour for taking his degree in \
his calling to have come; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when \
they invest him with the doctor's cap made of lint, to mend some bullet-hole, \
perhaps, that has gone through his temples, or left him with a crippled arm \
or leg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven watches over him and \
keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in the same poverty he was in \
before, and he must go through more engagements and more battles, and come \
victorious out of all before he betters himself; but miracles of that sort \
are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you have ever reflected upon it, by \
how much do those who have gained by war fall short of the number of those \
who have perished in it? No doubt you will reply that there can be no \
comparison, that the dead cannot be numbered, while the living who have been \
rewarded may be summed up with three figures. All which is the reverse in the \
case of men of letters; for by skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all \
find means of support; so that though the soldier has more to endure, his \
reward is much less. But against all this it may be urged that it is easier \
to reward two thousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by giving \
them places, which must perforce be conferred upon men of their calling, \
while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very property of the \
master they serve; but this impossibility only strengthens my argument. \
\"Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which it is \
difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of arms over \
letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments put forward on \
each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters say that without them \
arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too, has its laws and is governed \
by them, and laws belong to the domain of letters and men of letters. To this \
arms make answer that without them laws cannot be maintained, for by arms \
states are defended, kingdoms preserved, cities protected, roads made safe, \
seas cleared of pirates; and, in short, if it were not for them, states, \
kingdoms, monarchies, cities, ways by sea and land would be exposed to the \
violence and confusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is \
free to make use of its privileges and powers. And then it is plain that \
whatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most. To attain to \
eminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness, headaches, \
indigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which I have already \
referred to. But for a man to come in the ordinary course of things to be a \
good soldier costs him all the student suffers, and in an incomparably higher \
degree, for at every step he runs the risk of losing his life. For what dread \
of want or poverty that can reach or harass the student can compare with what \
the soldier feels, who finds himself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting \
guard in some ravelin or cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine \
towards the post where he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances \
retire or fly from the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do is \
to inform his captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by \
a counter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the \
moment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into the \
deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us see whether \
it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys stem to stem, in \
the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one with the other, when the \
soldier has no more standing room than two feet of the plank of the spur; and \
yet, though he sees before him threatening him as many ministers of death as \
there are cannon of the foe pointed at him, not a lance length from his body, \
and sees too that with the first heedless step he will go down to visit the \
profundities of Neptune's bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by \
honour that nerves him, he makes himself a target for all that musketry, and \
struggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy's ship. And what is still \
more marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths he will never \
rise from till the end of the world, than another takes his place; and if he \
too falls into the sea that waits for him like an enemy, another and another \
will succeed him without a moment's pause between their deaths: courage and \
daring the greatest that all the chances of war can show. Happy the blest \
ages that knew not the dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery, \
whose inventor I am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his \
diabolical invention, by which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to \
take the life of a gallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or \
whence, in the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate \
brave hearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one \
who fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine, which \
in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life of one who \
deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflect on this, I am \
almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having adopted this \
profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we live in now; for \
though no peril can make me fear, still it gives me some uneasiness to think \
that powder and lead may rob me of the opportunity of making myself famous \
and renowned throughout the known earth by the might of my arm and the edge \
of my sword. But Heaven's will be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be \
all the more honoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the \
knights-errant of yore exposed themselves to.\" All this lengthy discourse \
Don Quixote delivered while the others supped, forgetting to raise a morsel \
to his lips, though Sancho more than once told him to eat his supper, as he \
would have time enough afterwards to say all he wanted. It excited fresh pity \
in those who had heard him to see a man of apparently sound sense, and with \
rational views on every subject he discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, \
when his wretched unlucky chivalry was in question. The curate told him he \
was quite right in all he had said in favour of arms, and that he himself, \
though a man of letters and a graduate, was of the same opinion. They \
finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the hostess, her \
daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La Mancha's garret \
ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be quartered by \
themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the captive to tell them the \
story of his life, for it could not fail to be strange and interesting, to \
judge by the hints he had let fall on his arrival in company with Zoraida. To \
this the captive replied that he would very willingly yield to his request, \
only he feared his tale would not give them as much pleasure as he wished; \
nevertheless, not to be wanting in compliance, he would tell it. The curate \
and the others thanked him and added their entreaties, and he finding himself \
so pressed said there was no occasion ask, where a command had such weight, \
and added, \"If your worships will give me your attention you will hear a \
true story which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and \
studied art cannot come up to.\" These words made them settle themselves in \
their places and preserve a deep silence, and he seeing them waiting on his \
words in mute expectation, began thus in a pleasant quiet voice. CHAPTER \
XXXIX. WHEREIN THE CAPTIVE RELATES HIS LIFE AND ADVENTURES My family had its \
origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, and nature had been kinder and \
more generous to it than fortune; though in the general poverty of those \
communities my father passed for being even a rich man; and he would have \
been so in reality had he been as clever in preserving his property as he was \
in spending it. This tendency of his to be liberal and profuse he had \
acquired from having been a soldier in his youth, for the soldier's life is a \
school in which the niggard becomes free-handed and the free-handed prodigal; \
and if any soldiers are to be found who are misers, they are monsters of rare \
occurrence. My father went beyond liberality and bordered on prodigality, a \
disposition by no means advantageous to a married man who has children to \
succeed to his name and position. My father had three, all sons, and all of \
sufficient age to make choice of a profession. Finding, then, that he was \
unable to resist his propensity, he resolved to divest himself of the \
instrument and cause of his prodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of \
wealth, without which Alexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and \
so calling us all three aside one day into a room, he addressed us in words \
somewhat to the following effect: \"My sons, to assure you that I love you, \
no more need be known or said than that you are my sons; and to encourage a \
suspicion that I do not love you, no more is needed than the knowledge that I \
have no self-control as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned; \
therefore, that you may for the future feel sure that I love you like a \
father, and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to do with \
you what I have for some time back meditated, and after mature deliberation \
decided upon. You are now of an age to choose your line of life or at least \
make choice of a calling that will bring you honour and profit when you are \
older; and what I have resolved to do is to divide my property into four \
parts; three I will give to you, to each his portion without making any \
difference, and the other I will retain to live upon and support myself for \
whatever remainder of life Heaven may be pleased to grant me. But I wish each \
of you on taking possession of the share that falls to him to follow one of \
the paths I shall indicate. In this Spain of ours there is a proverb, to my \
mind very true--as they all are, being short aphorisms drawn from long \
practical experience--and the one I refer to says, 'The church, or the sea, \
or the king's house;' as much as to say, in plainer language, whoever wants \
to flourish and become rich, let him follow the church, or go to sea, \
adopting commerce as his calling, or go into the king's service in his \
household, for they say, 'Better a king's crumb than a lord's favour.' I say \
so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you should follow letters, \
another trade, and the third serve the king in the wars, for it is a \
difficult matter to gain admission to his service in his household, and if \
war does not bring much wealth it confers great distinction and fame. Eight \
days hence I will give you your full shares in money, without defrauding you \
of a farthing, as you will see in the end. Now tell me if you are willing to \
follow out my idea and advice as I have laid it before you.\" Having called \
upon me as the eldest to answer, I, after urging him not to strip himself of \
his property but to spend it all as he pleased, for we were young men able to \
gain our living, consented to comply with his wishes, and said that mine were \
to follow the profession of arms and thereby serve God and my king. My second \
brother having made the same proposal, decided upon going to the Indies, \
embarking the portion that fell to him in trade. The youngest, and in my \
opinion the wisest, said he would rather follow the church, or go to complete \
his studies at Salamanca. As soon as we had come to an understanding, and \
made choice of our professions, my father embraced us all, and in the short \
time he mentioned carried into effect all he had promised; and when he had \
given to each his share, which as well as I remember was three thousand \
ducats apiece in cash (for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid for it \
down, not to let it go out of the family), we all three on the same day took \
leave of our good father; and at the same time, as it seemed to me inhuman to \
leave my father with such scanty means in his old age, I induced him to take \
two of my three thousand ducats, as the remainder would be enough to provide \
me with all a soldier needed. My two brothers, moved by my example, gave him \
each a thousand ducats, so that there was left for my father four thousand \
ducats in money, besides three thousand, the value of the portion that fell \
to him which he preferred to retain in land instead of selling it. Finally, \
as I said, we took leave of him, and of our uncle whom I have mentioned, not \
without sorrow and tears on both sides, they charging us to let them know \
whenever an opportunity offered how we fared, whether well or ill. We \
promised to do so, and when he had embraced us and given us his blessing, one \
set out for Salamanca, the other for Seville, and I for Alicante, where I had \
heard there was a Genoese vessel taking in a cargo of wool for Genoa. It is \
now some twenty-two years since I left my father's house, and all that time, \
though I have written several letters, I have had no news whatever of him or \
of my brothers; my own adventures during that period I will now relate \
briefly. I embarked at Alicante, reached Genoa after a prosperous voyage, and \
proceeded thence to Milan, where I provided myself with arms and a few \
soldier's accoutrements; thence it was my intention to go and take service in \
Piedmont, but as I was already on the road to Alessandria della Paglia, I \
learned that the great Duke of Alva was on his way to Flanders. I changed my \
plans, joined him, served under him in the campaigns he made, was present at \
the deaths of the Counts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to be ensign under \
a famous captain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Some time after my \
arrival in Flanders news came of the league that his Holiness Pope Pius V of \
happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the common enemy, the \
Turk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famous island of Cyprus, \
which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable and disastrous. It was \
known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of Austria, natural brother of \
our good king Don Philip, was coming as commander-in-chief of the allied \
forces, and rumours were abroad of the vast warlike preparations which were \
being made, all which stirred my heart and filled me with a longing to take \
part in the campaign which was expected; and though I had reason to believe, \
and almost certain promises, that on the first opportunity that presented \
itself I should be promoted to be captain, I preferred to leave all and \
betake myself, as I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John \
had just arrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian \
fleet, as he afterwards did at Messina. I may say, in short, that I took part \
in that glorious expedition, promoted by this time to be a captain of \
infantry, to which honourable charge my good luck rather than my merits \
raised me; and that day--so fortunate for Christendom, because then all the \
nations of the earth were disabused of the error under which they lay in \
imagining the Turks to be invincible on sea-on that day, I say, on which the \
Ottoman pride and arrogance were broken, among all that were there made happy \
(for the Christians who died that day were happier than those who remained \
alive and victorious) I alone was miserable; for, instead of some naval crown \
that I might have expected had it been in Roman times, on the night that \
followed that famous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles \
on my hands. It happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a \
daring and successful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltese \
galley (only three knights being left alive in it, and they badly wounded), \
the chief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and my company were \
placed, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to do in such a case, I \
leaped on board the enemy's galley, which, sheering off from that which had \
attacked it, prevented my men from following me, and so I found myself alone \
in the midst of my enemies, who were in such numbers that I was unable to \
resist; in short I was taken, covered with wounds; El Uchali, as you know, \
sirs, made his escape with his entire squadron, and I was left a prisoner in \
his power, the only sad being among so many filled with joy, and the only \
captive among so many free; for there were fifteen thousand Christians, all \
at the oar in the Turkish fleet, that regained their longed-for liberty that \
day. They carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made my \
master general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and carried off \
as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of Malta. The following \
year, which was the year seventy-two, I found myself at Navarino rowing in \
the leading galley with the three lanterns. There I saw and observed how the \
opportunity of capturing the whole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all \
the marines and janizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were \
about to be attacked inside the very harbour, and had their kits and \
pasamaques, or shoes, ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be \
assailed, in so great fear did they stand of our fleet. But Heaven ordered it \
otherwise, not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded on our \
side, but for the sins of Christendom, and because it was God's will and \
pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishment to chastise us. \
As it was, El Uchali took refuge at Modon, which is an island near Navarino, \
and landing forces fortified the mouth of the harbour and waited quietly \
until Don John retired. On this expedition was taken the galley called the \
Prize, whose captain was a son of the famous corsair Barbarossa. It was taken \
by the chief Neapolitan galley called the She-wolf, commanded by that \
thunderbolt of war, that father of his men, that successful and unconquered \
captain Don Alvaro de Bazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I cannot help telling \
you what took place at the capture of the Prize. The son of Barbarossa was so \
cruel, and treated his slaves so badly, that, when those who were at the oars \
saw that the She-wolf galley was bearing down upon them and gaining upon \
them, they all at once dropped their oars and seized their captain who stood \
on the stage at the end of the gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and \
passing him on from bench to bench, from the poop to the prow, they so bit \
him that before he had got much past the mast his soul had already got to \
hell; so great, as I said, was the cruelty with which he treated them, and \
the hatred with which they hated him. We returned to Constantinople, and the \
following year, seventy-three, it became known that Don John had seized Tunis \
and taken the kingdom from the Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, \
putting an end to the hopes which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor \
in the world, entertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took \
the loss greatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess, \
he made peace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it than he \
was), and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Goletta and the \
fort which Don John had left half built near Tunis. While all these events \
were occurring, I was labouring at the oar without any hope of freedom; at \
least I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, for I was firmly resolved not \
to write to my father telling him of my misfortunes. At length the Goletta \
fell, and the fort fell, before which places there were seventy-five thousand \
regular Turkish soldiers, and more than four hundred thousand Moors and Arabs \
from all parts of Africa, and in the train of all this great host such \
munitions and engines of war, and so many pioneers that with their hands they \
might have covered the Goletta and the fort with handfuls of earth. The first \
to fall was the Goletta, until then reckoned impregnable, and it fell, not by \
any fault of its defenders, who did all that they could and should have done, \
but because experiment proved how easily entrenchments could be made in the \
desert sand there; for water used to be found at two palms depth, while the \
Turks found none at two yards; and so by means of a quantity of sandbags they \
raised their works so high that they commanded the walls of the fort, \
sweeping them as if from a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand \
or maintain the defence. It was a common opinion that our men should not have \
shut themselves up in the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the \
landing-place; but those who say so talk at random and with little knowledge \
of such matters; for if in the Goletta and in the fort there were barely \
seven thousand soldiers, how could such a small number, however resolute, \
sally out and hold their own against numbers like those of the enemy? And how \
is it possible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved, above all \
when surrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country? But \
many thought, and I thought so too, that it was special favour and mercy \
which Heaven showed to Spain in permitting the destruction of that source and \
hiding place of mischief, that devourer, sponge, and moth of countless money, \
fruitlessly wasted there to no other purpose save preserving the memory of \
its capture by the invincible Charles V; as if to make that eternal, as it is \
and will be, these stones were needed to support it. The fort also fell; but \
the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldiers who defended it fought \
so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the enemy killed in twenty-two \
general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand. Of three hundred that \
remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clear and manifest proof of \
their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdily they had defended themselves \
and held their post. A small fort or tower which was in the middle of the \
lagoon under the command of Don Juan Zanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a \
famous soldier, capitulated upon terms. They took prisoner Don Pedro \
Puertocarrero, commandant of the Goletta, who had done all in his power to \
defend his fortress, and took the loss of it so much to heart that he died of \
grief on the way to Constantinople, where they were carrying him a prisoner. \
They also took the commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a \
Milanese gentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier. In these two \
fortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria, knight \
of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as was shown by his \
extreme liberality to his brother, the famous John Andrea Doria; and what \
made his death the more sad was that he was slain by some Arabs to whom, \
seeing that the fort was now lost, he entrusted himself, and who offered to \
conduct him in the disguise of a Moor to Tabarca, a small fort or station on \
the coast held by the Genoese employed in the coral fishery. These Arabs cut \
off his head and carried it to the commander of the Turkish fleet, who proved \
on them the truth of our Castilian proverb, that \"though the treason may \
please, the traitor is hated;\" for they say he ordered those who brought him \
the present to be hanged for not having brought him alive. Among the \
Christians who were taken in the fort was one named Don Pedro de Aguilar, a \
native of some place, I know not what, in Andalusia, who had been ensign in \
the fort, a soldier of great repute and rare intelligence, who had in \
particular a special gift for what they call poetry. I say so because his \
fate brought him to my galley and to my bench, and made him a slave to the \
same master; and before we left the port this gentleman composed two sonnets \
by way of epitaphs, one on the Goletta and the other on the fort; indeed, I \
may as well repeat them, for I have them by heart, and I think they will be \
liked rather than disliked. The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don \
Pedro de Aguilar, Don Fernando looked at his companions and they all three \
smiled; and when he came to speak of the sonnets one of them said, \"Before \
your worship proceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of \
that Don Pedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.\" \"All I know is,\" replied \
the captive, \"that after having been in Constantinople two years, he escaped \
in the disguise of an Arnaut, in company with a Greek spy; but whether he \
regained his liberty or not I cannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a \
year afterwards I saw the Greek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask \
him what the result of the journey was.\" \"Well then, you are right,\" \
returned the gentleman, \"for that Don Pedro is my brother, and he is now in \
our village in good health, rich, married, and with three children.\" \
\"Thanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him,\" said the captive; \
\"for to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with recovering \
lost liberty.\" \"And what is more,\" said the gentleman, \"I know the \
sonnets my brother made.\" \"Then let your worship repeat them,\" said the \
captive, \"for you will recite them better than I can.\" \"With all my heart,\
\" said the gentleman; \"that on the Goletta runs thus.\" CHAPTER XL. IN \
WHICH THE STORY OF THE CAPTIVE IS CONTINUED. SONNET \"Blest souls, that, from \
this mortal husk set free, In guerdon of brave deeds beatified, Above this \
lowly orb of ours abide Made heirs of heaven and immortality, With noble rage \
and ardour glowing ye Your strength, while strength was yours, in battle \
plied, And with your own blood and the foeman's dyed The sandy soil and the \
encircling sea. It was the ebbing life-blood first that failed The weary \
arms; the stout hearts never quailed. Though vanquished, yet ye earned the \
victor's crown: Though mourned, yet still triumphant was your fall For there \
ye won, between the sword and wall, In Heaven glory and on earth renown.\" \
\"That is it exactly, according to my recollection,\" said the captive. \
\"Well then, that on the fort,\" said the gentleman, \"if my memory serves \
me, goes thus: SONNET \"Up from this wasted soil, this shattered shell, Whose \
walls and towers here in ruin lie, Three thousand soldier souls took wing on \
high, In the bright mansions of the blest to dwell. The onslaught of the \
foeman to repel By might of arm all vainly did they try, And when at length \
'twas left them but to die, Wearied and few the last defenders fell. And this \
same arid soil hath ever been A haunt of countless mournful memories, As well \
in our day as in days of yore. But never yet to Heaven it sent, I ween, From \
its hard bosom purer souls than these, Or braver bodies on its surface \
bore.\" The sonnets were not disliked, and the captive was rejoiced at the \
tidings they gave him of his comrade, and continuing his tale, he went on to \
say: The Goletta and the fort being thus in their hands, the Turks gave \
orders to dismantle the Goletta--for the fort was reduced to such a state \
that there was nothing left to level--and to do the work more quickly and \
easily they mined it in three places; but nowhere were they able to blow up \
the part which seemed to be the least strong, that is to say, the old walls, \
while all that remained standing of the new fortifications that the Fratin \
had made came to the ground with the greatest ease. Finally the fleet \
returned victorious and triumphant to Constantinople, and a few months later \
died my master, El Uchali, otherwise Uchali Fartax, which means in Turkish \
\"the scabby renegade;\" for that he was; it is the practice with the Turks \
to name people from some defect or virtue they may possess; the reason being \
that there are among them only four surnames belonging to families tracing \
their descent from the Ottoman house, and the others, as I have said, take \
their names and surnames either from bodily blemishes or moral qualities. \
This \"scabby one\" rowed at the oar as a slave of the Grand Signor's for \
fourteen years, and when over thirty-four years of age, in resentment at \
having been struck by a Turk while at the oar, turned renegade and renounced \
his faith in order to be able to revenge himself; and such was his valour \
that, without owing his advancement to the base ways and means by which most \
favourites of the Grand Signor rise to power, he came to be king of Algiers, \
and afterwards general-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the \
realm. He was a Calabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he treated \
his slaves with great humanity. He had three thousand of them, and after his \
death they were divided, as he directed by his will, between the Grand Signor \
(who is heir of all who die and shares with the children of the deceased) and \
his renegades. I fell to the lot of a Venetian renegade who, when a cabin boy \
on board a ship, had been taken by Uchali and was so much beloved by him that \
he became one of his most favoured youths. He came to be the most cruel \
renegade I ever saw: his name was Hassan Aga, and he grew very rich and \
became king of Algiers. With him I went there from Constantinople, rather \
glad to be so near Spain, not that I intended to write to anyone about my \
unhappy lot, but to try if fortune would be kinder to me in Algiers than in \
Constantinople, where I had attempted in a thousand ways to escape without \
ever finding a favourable time or chance; but in Algiers I resolved to seek \
for other means of effecting the purpose I cherished so dearly; for the hope \
of obtaining my liberty never deserted me; and when in my plots and schemes \
and attempts the result did not answer my expectations, without giving way to \
despair I immediately began to look out for or conjure up some new hope to \
support me, however faint or feeble it might be. In this way I lived on \
immured in a building or prison called by the Turks a bano in which they \
confine the Christian captives, as well those that are the king's as those \
belonging to private individuals, and also what they call those of the \
Almacen, which is as much as to say the slaves of the municipality, who serve \
the city in the public works and other employments; but captives of this kind \
recover their liberty with great difficulty, for, as they are public property \
and have no particular master, there is no one with whom to treat for their \
ransom, even though they may have the means. To these banos, as I have said, \
some private individuals of the town are in the habit of bringing their \
captives, especially when they are to be ransomed; because there they can \
keep them in safety and comfort until their ransom arrives. The king's \
captives also, that are on ransom, do not go out to work with the rest of the \
crew, unless when their ransom is delayed; for then, to make them write for \
it more pressingly, they compel them to work and go for wood, which is no \
light labour. I, however, was one of those on ransom, for when it was \
discovered that I was a captain, although I declared my scanty means and want \
of fortune, nothing could dissuade them from including me among the gentlemen \
and those waiting to be ransomed. They put a chain on me, more as a mark of \
this than to keep me safe, and so I passed my life in that bano with several \
other gentlemen and persons of quality marked out as held to ransom; but \
though at times, or rather almost always, we suffered from hunger and scanty \
clothing, nothing distressed us so much as hearing and seeing at every turn \
the unexampled and unheard-of cruelties my master inflicted upon the \
Christians. Every day he hanged a man, impaled one, cut off the ears of \
another; and all with so little provocation, or so entirely without any, that \
the Turks acknowledged he did it merely for the sake of doing it, and because \
he was by nature murderously disposed towards the whole human race. The only \
one that fared at all well with him was a Spanish soldier, something de \
Saavedra by name, to whom he never gave a blow himself, or ordered a blow to \
be given, or addressed a hard word, although he had done things that will \
dwell in the memory of the people there for many a year, and all to recover \
his liberty; and for the least of the many things he did we all dreaded that \
he would be impaled, and he himself was in fear of it more than once; and \
only that time does not allow, I could tell you now something of what that \
soldier did, that would interest and astonish you much more than the \
narration of my own tale. To go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison \
was overlooked by the windows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of \
high position; and these, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather \
loopholes than windows, and besides were covered with thick and close \
lattice-work. It so happened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of \
our prison with three other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far \
we could leap with our chains, we being alone, for all the other Christians \
had gone out to work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and from one of these \
little closed windows I saw a reed appear with a cloth attached to the end of \
it, and it kept waving to and fro, and moving as if making signs to us to \
come and take it. We watched it, and one of those who were with me went and \
stood under the reed to see whether they would let it drop, or what they \
would do, but as he did so the reed was raised and moved from side to side, \
as if they meant to say \"no\" by a shake of the head. The Christian came \
back, and it was again lowered, making the same movements as before. Another \
of my comrades went, and with him the same happened as with the first, and \
then the third went forward, but with the same result as the first and \
second. Seeing this I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as I came \
under the reed it was dropped and fell inside the bano at my feet. I hastened \
to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in this were ten cianis, \
which are coins of base gold, current among the Moors, and each worth ten \
reals of our money. It is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and \
my joy was not less than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good \
fortune could have come to us, but to me specially; for the evident \
unwillingness to drop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the \
favour was intended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to \
the terrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out \
that opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fancied that it \
must be some woman living in that house that had done us this kindness, and \
to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams after the fashion of \
the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and crossing the arms on the \
breast. Shortly afterwards at the same window a small cross made of reeds was \
put out and immediately withdrawn. This sign led us to believe that some \
Christian woman was a captive in the house, and that it was she who had been \
so good to us; but the whiteness of the hand and the bracelets we had \
perceived made us dismiss that idea, though we thought it might be one of the \
Christian renegades whom their masters very often take as lawful wives, and \
gladly, for they prefer them to the women of their own nation. In all our \
conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that time forward our sole \
occupation was watching and gazing at the window where the cross had appeared \
to us, as if it were our pole-star; but at least fifteen days passed without \
our seeing either it or the hand, or any other sign and though meanwhile we \
endeavoured with the utmost pains to ascertain who it was that lived in the \
house, and whether there were any Christian renegade in it, nobody could ever \
tell us anything more than that he who lived there was a rich Moor of high \
position, Hadji Morato by name, formerly alcaide of La Pata, an office of \
high dignity among them. But when we least thought it was going to rain any \
more cianis from that quarter, we saw the reed suddenly appear with another \
cloth tied in a larger knot attached to it, and this at a time when, as on \
the former occasion, the bano was deserted and unoccupied. We made trial as \
before, each of the same three going forward before I did; but the reed was \
delivered to none but me, and on my approach it was let drop. I untied the \
knot and I found forty Spanish gold crowns with a paper written in Arabic, \
and at the end of the writing there was a large cross drawn. I kissed the \
cross, took the crowns and returned to the terrace, and we all made our \
salaams; again the hand appeared, I made signs that I would read the paper, \
and then the window was closed. We were all puzzled, though filled with joy \
at what had taken place; and as none of us understood Arabic, great was our \
curiosity to know what the paper contained, and still greater the difficulty \
of finding some one to read it. At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, \
a native of Murcia, who professed a very great friendship for me, and had \
given pledges that bound him to keep any secret I might entrust to him; for \
it is the custom with some renegades, when they intend to return to Christian \
territory, to carry about them certificates from captives of mark testifying, \
in whatever form they can, that such and such a renegade is a worthy man who \
has always shown kindness to Christians, and is anxious to escape on the \
first opportunity that may present itself. Some obtain these testimonials \
with good intentions, others put them to a cunning use; for when they go to \
pillage on Christian territory, if they chance to be cast away, or taken \
prisoners, they produce their certificates and say that from these papers may \
be seen the object they came for, which was to remain on Christian ground, \
and that it was to this end they joined the Turks in their foray. In this way \
they escape the consequences of the first outburst and make their peace with \
the Church before it does them any harm, and then when they have the chance \
they return to Barbary to become what they were before. Others, however, \
there are who procure these papers and make use of them honestly, and remain \
on Christian soil. This friend of mine, then, was one of these renegades that \
I have described; he had certificates from all our comrades, in which we \
testified in his favour as strongly as we could; and if the Moors had found \
the papers they would have burned him alive. I knew that he understood Arabic \
very well, and could not only speak but also write it; but before I disclosed \
the whole matter to him, I asked him to read for me this paper which I had \
found by accident in a hole in my cell. He opened it and remained some time \
examining it and muttering to himself as he translated it. I asked him if he \
understood it, and he told me he did perfectly well, and that if I wished him \
to tell me its meaning word for word, I must give him pen and ink that he \
might do it more satisfactorily. We at once gave him what he required, and he \
set about translating it bit by bit, and when he had done he said: \"All that \
is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, and you must bear in \
mind that when it says 'Lela Marien' it means 'Our Lady the Virgin Mary.'\" \
We read the paper and it ran thus: \"When I was a child my father had a slave \
who taught me to pray the Christian prayer in my own language, and told me \
many things about Lela Marien. The Christian died, and I know that she did \
not go to the fire, but to Allah, because since then I have seen her twice, \
and she told me to go to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who \
had great love for me. I know not how to go. I have seen many Christians, but \
except thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young and \
beautiful, and have plenty of money to take with me. See if thou canst \
contrive how we may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband there, and \
if thou wilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marien will find me some \
one to marry me. I myself have written this: have a care to whom thou givest \
it to read: trust no Moor, for they are all perfidious. I am greatly troubled \
on this account, for I would not have thee confide in anyone, because if my \
father knew it he would at once fling me down a well and cover me with \
stones. I will put a thread to the reed; tie the answer to it, and if thou \
hast no one to write for thee in Arabic, tell it to me by signs, for Lela \
Marien will make me understand thee. She and Allah and this cross, which I \
often kiss as the captive bade me, protect thee.\" Judge, sirs, whether we \
had reason for surprise and joy at the words of this paper; and both one and \
the other were so great, that the renegade perceived that the paper had not \
been found by chance, but had been in reality addressed to some one of us, \
and he begged us, if what he suspected were the truth, to trust him and tell \
him all, for he would risk his life for our freedom; and so saying he took \
out from his breast a metal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God \
the image represented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he was, he truly and \
faithfully believed, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we chose to \
reveal to him; for he thought and almost foresaw that by means of her who had \
written that paper, he and all of us would obtain our liberty, and he himself \
obtain the object he so much desired, his restoration to the bosom of the \
Holy Mother Church, from which by his own sin and ignorance he was now \
severed like a corrupt limb. The renegade said this with so many tears and \
such signs of repentance, that with one consent we all agreed to tell him the \
whole truth of the matter, and so we gave him a full account of all, without \
hiding anything from him. We pointed out to him the window at which the reed \
appeared, and he by that means took note of the house, and resolved to \
ascertain with particular care who lived in it. We agreed also that it would \
be advisable to answer the Moorish lady's letter, and the renegade without a \
moment's delay took down the words I dictated to him, which were exactly what \
I shall tell you, for nothing of importance that took place in this affair \
has escaped my memory, or ever will while life lasts. This, then, was the \
answer returned to the Moorish lady: \"The true Allah protect thee, Lady, and \
that blessed Marien who is the true mother of God, and who has put it into \
thy heart to go to the land of the Christians, because she loves thee. \
Entreat her that she be pleased to show thee how thou canst execute the \
command she gives thee, for she will, such is her goodness. On my own part, \
and on that of all these Christians who are with me, I promise to do all that \
we can for thee, even to death. Fail not to write to me and inform me what \
thou dost mean to do, and I will always answer thee; for the great Allah has \
given us a Christian captive who can speak and write thy language well, as \
thou mayest see by this paper; without fear, therefore, thou canst inform us \
of all thou wouldst. As to what thou sayest, that if thou dost reach the land \
of the Christians thou wilt be my wife, I give thee my promise upon it as a \
good Christian; and know that the Christians keep their promises better than \
the Moors. Allah and Marien his mother watch over thee, my Lady.\" The paper \
being written and folded I waited two days until the bano was empty as \
before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the terrace to see if \
there were any sign of the reed, which was not long in making its appearance. \
As soon as I saw it, although I could not distinguish who put it out, I \
showed the paper as a sign to attach the thread, but it was already fixed to \
the reed, and to it I tied the paper; and shortly afterwards our star once \
more made its appearance with the white flag of peace, the little bundle. It \
was dropped, and I picked it up, and found in the cloth, in gold and silver \
coins of all sorts, more than fifty crowns, which fifty times more \
strengthened our joy and doubled our hope of gaining our liberty. That very \
night our renegade returned and said he had learned that the Moor we had been \
told of lived in that house, that his name was Hadji Morato, that he was \
enormously rich, that he had one only daughter the heiress of all his wealth, \
and that it was the general opinion throughout the city that she was the most \
beautiful woman in Barbary, and that several of the viceroys who came there \
had sought her for a wife, but that she had been always unwilling to marry; \
and he had learned, moreover, that she had a Christian slave who was now \
dead; all which agreed with the contents of the paper. We immediately took \
counsel with the renegade as to what means would have to be adopted in order \
to carry off the Moorish lady and bring us all to Christian territory; and in \
the end it was agreed that for the present we should wait for a second \
communication from Zoraida (for that was the name of her who now desires to \
be called Maria), because we saw clearly that she and no one else could find \
a way out of all these difficulties. When we had decided upon this the \
renegade told us not to be uneasy, for he would lose his life or restore us \
to liberty. For four days the bano was filled with people, for which reason \
the reed delayed its appearance for four days, but at the end of that time, \
when the bano was, as it generally was, empty, it appeared with the cloth so \
bulky that it promised a happy birth. Reed and cloth came down to me, and I \
found another paper and a hundred crowns in gold, without any other coin. The \
renegade was present, and in our cell we gave him the paper to read, which \
was to this effect: \"I cannot think of a plan, senor, for our going to \
Spain, nor has Lela Marien shown me one, though I have asked her. All that \
can be done is for me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. \
With it ransom yourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land \
of the Christians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others; and \
he will find me in my father's garden, which is at the Babazon gate near the \
seashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father and my servants. \
You can carry me away from there by night without any danger, and bring me to \
the vessel. And remember thou art to be my husband, else I will pray to \
Marien to punish thee. If thou canst not trust anyone to go for the vessel, \
ransom thyself and do thou go, for I know thou wilt return more surely than \
any other, as thou art a gentleman and a Christian. Endeavour to make thyself \
acquainted with the garden; and when I see thee walking yonder I shall know \
that the bano is empty and I will give thee abundance of money. Allah protect \
thee, senor.\" These were the words and contents of the second paper, and on \
hearing them, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, and \
promised to go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too made the same \
offer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that he would not on any \
account consent to one being set free before all went together, as experience \
had taught him how ill those who have been set free keep promises which they \
made in captivity; for captives of distinction frequently had recourse to \
this plan, paying the ransom of one who was to go to Valencia or Majorca with \
money to enable him to arm a bark and return for the others who had ransomed \
him, but who never came back; for recovered liberty and the dread of losing \
it again efface from the memory all the obligations in the world. And to \
prove the truth of what he said, he told us briefly what had happened to a \
certain Christian gentleman almost at that very time, the strangest case that \
had ever occurred even there, where astonishing and marvellous things are \
happening every instant. In short, he ended by saying that what could and \
ought to be done was to give the money intended for the ransom of one of us \
Christians to him, so that he might with it buy a vessel there in Algiers \
under the pretence of becoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the \
coast; and when master of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit on some \
way of getting us all out of the bano and putting us on board; especially if \
the Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom all, because once \
free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark even in open \
day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do not allow any renegade \
to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vessel for going on roving \
expeditions, because they are afraid that anyone who buys a small vessel, \
especially if he be a Spaniard, only wants it for the purpose of escaping to \
Christian territory. This however he could get over by arranging with a \
Tagarin Moor to go shares with him in the purchase of the vessel, and in the \
profit on the cargo; and under cover of this he could become master of the \
vessel, in which case he looked upon all the rest as accomplished. But though \
to me and my comrades it had seemed a better plan to send to Majorca for the \
vessel, as the Moorish lady suggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearing \
that if we did not do as he said he would denounce us, and place us in danger \
of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings with Zoraida, for \
whose life we would have all given our own. We therefore resolved to put \
ourselves in the hands of God and in the renegade's; and at the same time an \
answer was given to Zoraida, telling her that we would do all she \
recommended, for she had given as good advice as if Lela Marien had delivered \
it, and that it depended on her alone whether we were to defer the business \
or put it in execution at once. I renewed my promise to be her husband; and \
thus the next day that the bano chanced to be empty she at different times \
gave us by means of the reed and cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper \
in which she said that the next Juma, that is to say Friday, she was going to \
her father's garden, but that before she went she would give us more money; \
and if it were not enough we were to let her know, as she would give us as \
much as we asked, for her father had so much he would not miss it, and \
besides she kept all the keys. We at once gave the renegade five hundred \
crowns to buy the vessel, and with eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving \
the money to a Valencian merchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, \
and who had me released on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the \
first ship from Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the \
money at once it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had \
been for a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his own \
advantage kept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to deal with \
that I dared not on any account pay down the money at once. The Thursday \
before the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the garden she gave \
us a thousand crowns more, and warned us of her departure, begging me, if I \
were ransomed, to find out her father's garden at once, and by all means to \
seek an opportunity of going there to see her. I answered in a few words that \
I would do so, and that she must remember to commend us to Lela Marien with \
all the prayers the captive had taught her. This having been done, steps were \
taken to ransom our three comrades, so as to enable them to quit the bano, \
and lest, seeing me ransomed and themselves not, though the money was \
forthcoming, they should make a disturbance about it and the devil should \
prompt them to do something that might injure Zoraida; for though their \
position might be sufficient to relieve me from this apprehension, \
nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk in the matter; and so I had them \
ransomed in the same way as I was, handing over all the money to the merchant \
so that he might with safety and confidence give security; without, however, \
confiding our arrangement and secret to him, which might have been dangerous. \
CHAPTER XLI. IN WHICH THE CAPTIVE STILL CONTINUES HIS ADVENTURES Before \
fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an excellent vessel \
with room for more than thirty persons; and to make the transaction safe and \
lend a colour to it, he thought it well to make, as he did, a voyage to a \
place called Shershel, twenty leagues from Algiers on the Oran side, where \
there is an extensive trade in dried figs. Two or three times he made this \
voyage in company with the Tagarin already mentioned. The Moors of Aragon are \
called Tagarins in Barbary, and those of Granada Mudejars; but in the Kingdom \
of Fez they call the Mudejars Elches, and they are the people the king \
chiefly employs in war. To proceed: every time he passed with his vessel he \
anchored in a cove that was not two crossbow shots from the garden where \
Zoraida was waiting; and there the renegade, together with the two Moorish \
lads that rowed, used purposely to station himself, either going through his \
prayers, or else practising as a part what he meant to perform in earnest. \
And thus he would go to Zoraida's garden and ask for fruit, which her father \
gave him, not knowing him; but though, as he afterwards told me, he sought to \
speak to Zoraida, and tell her who he was, and that by my orders he was to \
take her to the land of the Christians, so that she might feel satisfied and \
easy, he had never been able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow \
themselves to be seen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid \
them: with Christian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and \
communication, even more than might be considered proper. But for my part I \
should have been sorry if he had spoken to her, for perhaps it might have \
alarmed her to find her affairs talked of by renegades. But God, who ordered \
it otherwise, afforded no opportunity for our renegade's well-meant purpose; \
and he, seeing how safely he could go to Shershel and return, and anchor when \
and how and where he liked, and that the Tagarin his partner had no will but \
his, and that, now I was ransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians \
to row, told me to look out for any I should be willing to take with me, over \
and above those who had been ransomed, and to engage them for the next \
Friday, which he fixed upon for our departure. On this I spoke to twelve \
Spaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave the city; \
but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, because there were \
twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the rowers with them; and \
these would not have been found were it not that their master remained at \
home that summer without going to sea in order to finish a galliot that he \
had upon the stocks. To these men I said nothing more than that the next \
Friday in the evening they were to come out stealthily one by one and hang \
about Hadji Morato's garden, waiting for me there until I came. These \
directions I gave each one separately, with orders that if they saw any other \
Christians there they were not to say anything to them except that I had \
directed them to wait at that spot. This preliminary having been settled, \
another still more necessary step had to be taken, which was to let Zoraida \
know how matters stood that she might be prepared and forewarned, so as not \
to be taken by surprise if we were suddenly to seize upon her before she \
thought the Christians' vessel could have returned. I determined, therefore, \
to go to the garden and try if I could speak to her; and the day before my \
departure I went there under the pretence of gathering herbs. The first \
person I met was her father, who addressed me in the language that all over \
Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium between captives and Moors, \
and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any other nation, but a mixture \
of all languages, by means of which we can all understand one another. In \
this sort of language, I say, he asked me what I wanted in his garden, and to \
whom I belonged. I replied that I was a slave of the Arnaut Mami (for I knew \
as a certainty that he was a very great friend of his), and that I wanted \
some herbs to make a salad. He asked me then whether I were on ransom or not, \
and what my master demanded for me. While these questions and answers were \
proceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some time before, \
came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women are by no means \
particular about letting themselves be seen by Christians, or, as I have said \
before, at all coy, she had no hesitation in coming to where her father stood \
with me; moreover her father, seeing her approaching slowly, called to her to \
come. It would be beyond my power now to describe to you the great beauty, \
the high-bred air, the brilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she \
presented herself before my eyes. I will content myself with saying that more \
pearls hung from her fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on \
her head. On her ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes \
(for so bracelets or anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold, set \
with so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valued them at \
ten thousand doubloons, and those she had on her wrists were worth as much \
more. The pearls were in profusion and very fine, for the highest display and \
adornment of the Moorish women is decking themselves with rich pearls and \
seed-pearls; and of these there are therefore more among the Moors than among \
any other people. Zoraida's father had to the reputation of possessing a \
great number, and the purest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than \
two hundred thousand Spanish crowns; and she, who is now mistress of me only, \
was mistress of all this. Whether thus adorned she would have been beautiful \
or not, and what she must have been in her prosperity, may be imagined from \
the beauty remaining to her after so many hardships; for, as everyone knows, \
the beauty of some women has its times and its seasons, and is increased or \
diminished by chance causes; and naturally the emotions of the mind will \
heighten or impair it, though indeed more frequently they totally destroy it. \
In a word she presented herself before me that day attired with the utmost \
splendour, and supremely beautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most \
beautiful object I had ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed \
to her I felt as though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to \
bring me relief and happiness. As she approached her father told her in his \
own language that I was a captive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, \
and that I had come for salad. She took up the conversation, and in that \
mixture of tongues I have spoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and \
why I was not ransomed. I answered that I was already ransomed, and that by \
the price it might be seen what value my master set on me, as I had given one \
thousand five hundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, \"Hadst thou \
been my father's, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee \
for twice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and \
make yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.\" \"That may be, lady,\" said I; \
\"but indeed I dealt truthfully with my master, as I do and mean to do with \
everybody in the world.\" \"And when dost thou go?\" said Zoraida. \
\"To-morrow, I think,\" said I, \"for there is a vessel here from France \
which sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.\" \"Would it not be \
better,\" said Zoraida, \"to wait for the arrival of ships from Spain and go \
with them and not with the French who are not your friends?\" \"No,\" said I; \
\"though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now coming from Spain \
it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it is more likely I shall \
depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to return to my country and to those \
I love is so great that it will not allow me to wait for another opportunity, \
however more convenient, if it be delayed.\" \"No doubt thou art married in \
thine own country,\" said Zoraida, \"and for that reason thou art anxious to \
go and see thy wife.\" \"I am not married,\" I replied, \"but I have given my \
promise to marry on my arrival there.\" \"And is the lady beautiful to whom \
thou hast given it?\" said Zoraida. \"So beautiful,\" said I, \"that, to \
describe her worthily and tell thee the truth, she is very like thee.\" At \
this her father laughed very heartily and said, \"By Allah, Christian, she \
must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who is the most beautiful \
woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well and thou wilt see I am \
telling the truth.\" Zoraida's father as the better linguist helped to \
interpret most of these words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard \
language, that, as I have said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning \
more by signs than by words. While we were still engaged in this \
conversation, a Moor came running up, exclaiming that four Turks had leaped \
over the fence or wall of the garden, and were gathering the fruit though it \
was not yet ripe. The old man was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors \
commonly, and, so to speak, instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but \
particularly of the soldiers, who are so insolent and domineering to the \
Moors who are under their power that they treat them worse than if they were \
their slaves. Her father said to Zoraida, \"Daughter, retire into the house \
and shut thyself in while I go and speak to these dogs; and thou, Christian, \
pick thy herbs, and go in peace, and Allah bring thee safe to thy own \
country.\" I bowed, and he went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone \
with Zoraida, who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade her; \
but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden, turning to me \
with her eyes full of tears she said, \"Tameji, cristiano, tameji?\" that is \
to say, \"Art thou going, Christian, art thou going?\" I made answer, \"Yes, \
lady, but not without thee, come what may: be on the watch for me on the next \
Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seest us; for most surely we shall go to \
the land of the Christians.\" This I said in such a way that she understood \
perfectly all that passed between us, and throwing her arm round my neck she \
began with feeble steps to move towards the house; but as fate would have it \
(and it might have been very unfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise ordered \
it), just as we were moving on in the manner and position I have described, \
with her arm round my neck, her father, as he returned after having sent away \
the Turks, saw how we were walking and we perceived that he saw us; but \
Zoraida, ready and quickwitted, took care not to remove her arm from my neck, \
but on the contrary drew closer to me and laid her head on my breast, bending \
her knees a little and showing all the signs and tokens of fainting, while I \
at the same time made it seem as though I were supporting her against my \
will. Her father came running up to where we were, and seeing his daughter in \
this state asked what was the matter with her; she, however, giving no \
answer, he said, \"No doubt she has fainted in alarm at the entrance of those \
dogs,\" and taking her from mine he drew her to his own breast, while she \
sighing, her eyes still wet with tears, said again, \"Ameji, cristiano, ameji\
\"--\"Go, Christian, go.\" To this her father replied, \"There is no need, \
daughter, for the Christian to go, for he has done thee no harm, and the \
Turks have now gone; feel no alarm, there is nothing to hurt thee, for as I \
say, the Turks at my request have gone back the way they came.\" \"It was \
they who terrified her, as thou hast said, senor,\" said I to her father; \
\"but since she tells me to go, I have no wish to displease her: peace be \
with thee, and with thy leave I will come back to this garden for herbs if \
need be, for my master says there are nowhere better herbs for salad then \
here.\" \"Come back for any thou hast need of,\" replied Hadji Morato; \"for \
my daughter does not speak thus because she is displeased with thee or any \
Christian: she only meant that the Turks should go, not thou; or that it was \
time for thee to look for thy herbs.\" With this I at once took my leave of \
both; and she, looking as though her heart were breaking, retired with her \
father. While pretending to look for herbs I made the round of the garden at \
my ease, and studied carefully all the approaches and outlets, and the \
fastenings of the house and everything that could be taken advantage of to \
make our task easy. Having done so I went and gave an account of all that had \
taken place to the renegade and my comrades, and looked forward with \
impatience to the hour when, all fear at an end, I should find myself in \
possession of the prize which fortune held out to me in the fair and lovely \
Zoraida. The time passed at length, and the appointed day we so longed for \
arrived; and, all following out the arrangement and plan which, after careful \
consideration and many a long discussion, we had decided upon, we succeeded \
as fully as we could have wished; for on the Friday following the day upon \
which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, the renegade anchored his vessel at \
nightfall almost opposite the spot where she was. The Christians who were to \
row were ready and in hiding in different places round about, all waiting for \
me, anxious and elated, and eager to attack the vessel they had before their \
eyes; for they did not know the renegade's plan, but expected that they were \
to gain their liberty by force of arms and by killing the Moors who were on \
board the vessel. As soon, then, as I and my comrades made our appearance, \
all those that were in hiding seeing us came and joined us. It was now the \
time when the city gates are shut, and there was no one to be seen in all the \
space outside. When we were collected together we debated whether it would be \
better first to go for Zoraida, or to make prisoners of the Moorish rowers \
who rowed in the vessel; but while we were still uncertain our renegade came \
up asking us what kept us, as it was now the time, and all the Moors were off \
their guard and most of them asleep. We told him why we hesitated, but he \
said it was of more importance first to secure the vessel, which could be \
done with the greatest ease and without any danger, and then we could go for \
Zoraida. We all approved of what he said, and so without further delay, \
guided by him we made for the vessel, and he leaping on board first, drew his \
cutlass and said in Morisco, \"Let no one stir from this if he does not want \
it to cost him his life.\" By this almost all the Christians were on board, \
and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearing their captain speak in this \
way, were cowed, and without any one of them taking to his arms (and indeed \
they had few or hardly any) they submitted without saying a word to be bound \
by the Christians, who quickly secured them, threatening them that if they \
raised any kind of outcry they would be all put to the sword. This having \
been accomplished, and half of our party being left to keep guard over them, \
the rest of us, again taking the renegade as our guide, hastened towards \
Hadji Morato's garden, and as good luck would have it, on trying the gate it \
opened as easily as if it had not been locked; and so, quite quietly and in \
silence, we reached the house without being perceived by anybody. The lovely \
Zoraida was watching for us at a window, and as soon as she perceived that \
there were people there, she asked in a low voice if we were \"Nizarani,\" as \
much as to say or ask if we were Christians. I answered that we were, and \
begged her to come down. As soon as she recognised me she did not delay an \
instant, but without answering a word came down immediately, opened the door \
and presented herself before us all, so beautiful and so richly attired that \
I cannot attempt to describe her. The moment I saw her I took her hand and \
kissed it, and the renegade and my two comrades did the same; and the rest, \
who knew nothing of the circumstances, did as they saw us do, for it only \
seemed as if we were returning thanks to her, and recognising her as the \
giver of our liberty. The renegade asked her in the Morisco language if her \
father was in the house. She replied that he was and that he was asleep. \
\"Then it will be necessary to waken him and take him with us,\" said the \
renegade, \"and everything of value in this fair mansion.\" \"Nay,\" said \
she, \"my father must not on any account be touched, and there is nothing in \
the house except what I shall take, and that will be quite enough to enrich \
and satisfy all of you; wait a little and you shall see,\" and so saying she \
went in, telling us she would return immediately and bidding us keep quiet \
making any noise. I asked the renegade what had passed between them, and when \
he told me, I declared that nothing should be done except in accordance with \
the wishes of Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full of gold \
crowns that she could scarcely carry it. Unfortunately her father awoke while \
this was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came to the window, and \
at once perceiving that all those who were there were Christians, raising a \
prodigiously loud outcry, he began to call out in Arabic, \"Christians, \
Christians! thieves, thieves!\" by which cries we were all thrown into the \
greatest fear and embarrassment; but the renegade seeing the danger we were \
in and how important it was for him to effect his purpose before we were \
heard, mounted with the utmost quickness to where Hadji Morato was, and with \
him went some of our party; I, however, did not dare to leave Zoraida, who \
had fallen almost fainting in my arms. To be brief, those who had gone \
upstairs acted so promptly that in an instant they came down, carrying Hadji \
Morato with his hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth, which prevented \
him from uttering a word, warning him at the same time that to attempt to \
speak would cost him his life. When his daughter caught sight of him she \
covered her eyes so as not to see him, and her father was horror-stricken, \
not knowing how willingly she had placed herself in our hands. But it was now \
most essential for us to be on the move, and carefully and quickly we \
regained the vessel, where those who had remained on board were waiting for \
us in apprehension of some mishap having befallen us. It was barely two hours \
after night set in when we were all on board the vessel, where the cords were \
removed from the hands of Zoraida's father, and the napkin from his mouth; \
but the renegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take \
his life. He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and \
still more when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and that she \
lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing any reluctance; \
nevertheless he remained silent lest they should carry into effect the \
repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him. Finding herself now on \
board, and that we were about to give way with the oars, Zoraida, seeing her \
father there, and the other Moors bound, bade the renegade ask me to do her \
the favour of releasing the Moors and setting her father at liberty, for she \
would rather drown herself in the sea than suffer a father that had loved her \
so dearly to be carried away captive before her eyes and on her account. The \
renegade repeated this to me, and I replied that I was very willing to do so; \
but he replied that it was not advisable, because if they were left there \
they would at once raise the country and stir up the city, and lead to the \
despatch of swift cruisers in pursuit, and our being taken, by sea or land, \
without any possibility of escape; and that all that could be done was to set \
them free on the first Christian ground we reached. On this point we all \
agreed; and Zoraida, to whom it was explained, together with the reasons that \
prevented us from doing at once what she desired, was satisfied likewise; and \
then in glad silence and with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took \
his oar, and commending ourselves to God with all our hearts, we began to \
shape our course for the island of Majorca, the nearest Christian land. \
Owing, however, to the Tramontana rising a little, and the sea growing \
somewhat rough, it was impossible for us to keep a straight course for \
Majorca, and we were compelled to coast in the direction of Oran, not without \
great uneasiness on our part lest we should be observed from the town of \
Shershel, which lies on that coast, not more than sixty miles from Algiers. \
Moreover we were afraid of meeting on that course one of the galliots that \
usually come with goods from Tetuan; although each of us for himself and all \
of us together felt confident that, if we were to meet a merchant galliot, so \
that it were not a cruiser, not only should we not be lost, but that we \
should take a vessel in which we could more safely accomplish our voyage. As \
we pursued our course Zoraida kept her head between my hands so as not to see \
her father, and I felt that she was praying to Lela Marien to help us. We \
might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some three \
musket-shots off the land, which seemed to us deserted, and without anyone to \
see us. For all that, however, by hard rowing we put out a little to sea, for \
it was now somewhat calmer, and having gained about two leagues the word was \
given to row by batches, while we ate something, for the vessel was well \
provided; but the rowers said it was not a time to take any rest; let food be \
served out to those who were not rowing, but they would not leave their oars \
on any account. This was done, but now a stiff breeze began to blow, which \
obliged us to leave off rowing and make sail at once and steer for Oran, as \
it was impossible to make any other course. All this was done very promptly, \
and under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without any fear, except \
that of coming across some vessel out on a roving expedition. We gave the \
Moorish rowers some food, and the renegade comforted them by telling them \
that they were not held as captives, as we should set them free on the first \
opportunity. The same was said to Zoraida's father, who replied, \"Anything \
else, Christian, I might hope for or think likely from your generosity and \
good behaviour, but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will give me \
my liberty; for you would have never exposed yourselves to the danger of \
depriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously, especially as you \
know who I am and the sum you may expect to receive on restoring it; and if \
you will only name that, I here offer you all you require for myself and for \
my unhappy daughter there; or else for her alone, for she is the greatest and \
most precious part of my soul.\" As he said this he began to weep so bitterly \
that he filled us all with compassion and forced Zoraida to look at him, and \
when she saw him weeping she was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran \
to throw her arms round him, and pressing her face to his, they both gave way \
to such an outburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keep them \
company. But when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewels \
about her, he said to her in his own language, \"What means this, my \
daughter? Last night, before this terrible misfortune in which we are plunged \
befell us, I saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments; and now, without \
having had time to attire thyself, and without my bringing thee any joyful \
tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and bedecking thyself, I see thee \
arrayed in the finest attire it would be in my power to give thee when \
fortune was most kind to us. Answer me this; for it causes me greater anxiety \
and surprise than even this misfortune itself.\" The renegade interpreted to \
us what the Moor said to his daughter; she, however, returned him no answer. \
But when he observed in one corner of the vessel the little trunk in which \
she used to keep her jewels, which he well knew he had left in Algiers and \
had not brought to the garden, he was still more amazed, and asked her how \
that trunk had come into our hands, and what there was in it. To which the \
renegade, without waiting for Zoraida to reply, made answer, \"Do not trouble \
thyself by asking thy daughter Zoraida so many questions, senor, for the one \
answer I will give thee will serve for all; I would have thee know that she \
is a Christian, and that it is she who has been the file for our chains and \
our deliverer from captivity. She is here of her own free will, as glad, I \
imagine, to find herself in this position as he who escapes from darkness \
into the light, from death to life, and from suffering to glory.\" \
\"Daughter, is this true, what he says?\" cried the Moor. \"It is,\" replied \
Zoraida. \"That thou art in truth a Christian,\" said the old man, \"and that \
thou hast given thy father into the power of his enemies?\" To which Zoraida \
made answer, \"A Christian I am, but it is not I who have placed thee in this \
position, for it never was my wish to leave thee or do thee harm, but only to \
do good to myself.\" \"And what good hast thou done thyself, daughter?\" said \
he. \"Ask thou that,\" said she, \"of Lela Marien, for she can tell thee \
better than I.\" The Moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous \
quickness he flung himself headforemost into the sea, where no doubt he would \
have been drowned had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a \
little on the surface of the water. Zoraida cried aloud to us to save him, \
and we all hastened to help, and seizing him by his robe we drew him in half \
drowned and insensible, at which Zoraida was in such distress that she wept \
over him as piteously and bitterly as though he were already dead. We turned \
him upon his face and he voided a great quantity of water, and at the end of \
two hours came to himself. Meanwhile, the wind having changed we were \
compelled to head for the land, and ply our oars to avoid being driven on \
shore; but it was our good fortune to reach a creek that lies on one side of \
a small promontory or cape, called by the Moors that of the \"Cava rumia,\" \
which in our language means \"the wicked Christian woman;\" for it is a \
tradition among them that La Cava, through whom Spain was lost, lies buried \
at that spot; \"cava\" in their language meaning \"wicked woman,\" and \
\"rumia\" \"Christian;\" moreover, they count it unlucky to anchor there when \
necessity compels them, and they never do so otherwise. For us, however, it \
was not the resting-place of the wicked woman but a haven of safety for our \
relief, so much had the sea now got up. We posted a look-out on shore, and \
never let the oars out of our hands, and ate of the stores the renegade had \
laid in, imploring God and Our Lady with all our hearts to help and protect \
us, that we might give a happy ending to a beginning so prosperous. At the \
entreaty of Zoraida orders were given to set on shore her father and the \
other Moors who were still bound, for she could not endure, nor could her \
tender heart bear to see her father in bonds and her fellow-countrymen \
prisoners before her eyes. We promised her to do this at the moment of \
departure, for as it was uninhabited we ran no risk in releasing them at that \
place. Our prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by Heaven, for \
after a while the wind changed in our favour, and made the sea calm, inviting \
us once more to resume our voyage with a good heart. Seeing this we unbound \
the Moors, and one by one put them on shore, at which they were filled with \
amazement; but when we came to land Zoraida's father, who had now completely \
recovered his senses, he said: \"Why is it, think ye, Christians, that this \
wicked woman is rejoiced at your giving me my liberty? Think ye it is because \
of the affection she bears me? Nay verily, it is only because of the \
hindrance my presence offers to the execution of her base designs. And think \
not that it is her belief that yours is better than ours that has led her to \
change her religion; it is only because she knows that immodesty is more \
freely practised in your country than in ours.\" Then turning to Zoraida, \
while I and another of the Christians held him fast by both arms, lest he \
should do some mad act, he said to her, \"Infamous girl, misguided maiden, \
whither in thy blindness and madness art thou going in the hands of these \
dogs, our natural enemies? Cursed be the hour when I begot thee! Cursed the \
luxury and indulgence in which I reared thee!\" But seeing that he was not \
likely soon to cease I made haste to put him on shore, and thence he \
continued his maledictions and lamentations aloud; calling on Mohammed to \
pray to Allah to destroy us, to confound us, to make an end of us; and when, \
in consequence of having made sail, we could no longer hear what he said we \
could see what he did; how he plucked out his beard and tore his hair and lay \
writhing on the ground. But once he raised his voice to such a pitch that we \
were able to hear what he said. \"Come back, dear daughter, come back to \
shore; I forgive thee all; let those men have the money, for it is theirs \
now, and come back to comfort thy sorrowing father, who will yield up his \
life on this barren strand if thou dost leave him.\" All this Zoraida heard, \
and heard with sorrow and tears, and all she could say in answer was, \"Allah \
grant that Lela Marien, who has made me become a Christian, give thee comfort \
in thy sorrow, my father. Allah knows that I could not do otherwise than I \
have done, and that these Christians owe nothing to my will; for even had I \
wished not to accompany them, but remain at home, it would have been \
impossible for me, so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of \
this purpose, which I feel to be as righteous as to thee, dear father, it \
seems wicked.\" But neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she \
said this; and so, while I consoled Zoraida, we turned our attention to our \
voyage, in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we made \
sure of finding ourselves off the coast of Spain on the morrow by daybreak. \
But, as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed, without being attended \
or followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock to it, our fortune, or \
perhaps the curses which the Moor had hurled at his daughter (for whatever \
kind of father they may come from these are always to be dreaded), brought it \
about that when we were now in mid-sea, and the night about three hours \
spent, as we were running with all sail set and oars lashed, for the \
favouring breeze saved us the trouble of using them, we saw by the light of \
the moon, which shone brilliantly, a square-rigged vessel in full sail close \
to us, luffing up and standing across our course, and so close that we had to \
strike sail to avoid running foul of her, while they too put the helm hard up \
to let us pass. They came to the side of the ship to ask who we were, whither \
we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked this in French our \
renegade said, \"Let no one answer, for no doubt these are French corsairs \
who plunder all comers.\" Acting on this warning no one answered a word, but \
after we had gone a little ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, \
suddenly they fired two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for \
with one they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into \
the sea, and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball into our \
vessel amidships, staving her in completely, but without doing any further \
damage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to shout for help and \
call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill. They \
then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as many as a dozen Frenchmen, well \
armed with match-locks, and their matches burning, got into it and came \
alongside; and seeing how few we were, and that our vessel was going down, \
they took us in, telling us that this had come to us through our incivility \
in not giving them an answer. Our renegade took the trunk containing \
Zoraida's wealth and dropped it into the sea without anyone perceiving what \
he did. In short we went on board with the Frenchmen, who, after having \
ascertained all they wanted to know about us, rifled us of everything we had, \
as if they had been our bitterest enemies, and from Zoraida they took even \
the anklets she wore on her feet; but the distress they caused her did not \
distress me so much as the fear I was in that from robbing her of her rich \
and precious jewels they would proceed to rob her of the most precious jewel \
that she valued more than all. The desires, however, of those people do not \
go beyond money, but of that their covetousness is insatiable, and on this \
occasion it was carried to such a pitch that they would have taken even the \
clothes we wore as captives if they had been worth anything to them. It was \
the advice of some of them to throw us all into the sea wrapped up in a sail; \
for their purpose was to trade at some of the ports of Spain, giving \
themselves out as Bretons, and if they brought us alive they would be \
punished as soon as the robbery was discovered; but the captain (who was the \
one who had plundered my beloved Zoraida) said he was satisfied with the \
prize he had got, and that he would not touch at any Spanish port, but pass \
the Straits of Gibraltar by night, or as best he could, and make for La \
Rochelle, from which he had sailed. So they agreed by common consent to give \
us the skiff belonging to their ship and all we required for the short voyage \
that remained to us, and this they did the next day on coming in sight of the \
Spanish coast, with which, and the joy we felt, all our sufferings and \
miseries were as completely forgotten as if they had never been endured by \
us, such is the delight of recovering lost liberty. It may have been about \
mid-day when they placed us in the boat, giving us two kegs of water and some \
biscuit; and the captain, moved by I know not what compassion, as the lovely \
Zoraida was about to embark, gave her some forty gold crowns, and would not \
permit his men to take from her those same garments which she has on now. We \
got into the boat, returning them thanks for their kindness to us, and \
showing ourselves grateful rather than indignant. They stood out to sea, \
steering for the straits; we, without looking to any compass save the land we \
had before us, set ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were \
so near that we might easily, we thought, land before the night was far \
advanced. But as the moon did not show that night, and the sky was clouded, \
and as we knew not whereabouts we were, it did not seem to us a prudent thing \
to make for the shore, as several of us advised, saying we ought to run \
ourselves ashore even if it were on rocks and far from any habitation, for in \
this way we should be relieved from the apprehensions we naturally felt of \
the prowling vessels of the Tetuan corsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfall \
and are on the Spanish coast by daybreak, where they commonly take some \
prize, and then go home to sleep in their own houses. But of the conflicting \
counsels the one which was adopted was that we should approach gradually, and \
land where we could if the sea were calm enough to permit us. This was done, \
and a little before midnight we drew near to the foot of a huge and lofty \
mountain, not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space on which to \
land conveniently. We ran our boat up on the sand, and all sprang out and \
kissed the ground, and with tears of joyful satisfaction returned thanks to \
God our Lord for all his incomparable goodness to us on our voyage. We took \
out of the boat the provisions it contained, and drew it up on the shore, and \
then climbed a long way up the mountain, for even there we could not feel \
easy in our hearts, or persuade ourselves that it was Christian soil that was \
now under our feet. The dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have \
wished; we completed the ascent in order to see if from the summit any \
habitation or any shepherds' huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as \
we might, neither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could we \
perceive. However, we determined to push on farther, as it could not but be \
that ere long we must see some one who could tell us where we were. But what \
distressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot over that rough ground; \
for though I once carried her on my shoulders, she was more wearied by my \
weariness than rested by the rest; and so she would never again allow me to \
undergo the exertion, and went on very patiently and cheerfully, while I led \
her by the hand. We had gone rather less than a quarter of a league when the \
sound of a little bell fell on our ears, a clear proof that there were flocks \
hard by, and looking about carefully to see if any were within view, we \
observed a young shepherd tranquilly and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with \
his knife at the foot of a cork tree. We called to him, and he, raising his \
head, sprang nimbly to his feet, for, as we afterwards learned, the first who \
presented themselves to his sight were the renegade and Zoraida, and seeing \
them in Moorish dress he imagined that all the Moors of Barbary were upon \
him; and plunging with marvellous swiftness into the thicket in front of him, \
he began to raise a prodigious outcry, exclaiming, \"The Moors--the Moors \
have landed! To arms, to arms!\" We were all thrown into perplexity by these \
cries, not knowing what to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd \
would raise the country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once \
to see what was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off his \
Turkish garments and put on a captive's jacket or coat which one of our party \
gave him at once, though he himself was reduced to his shirt; and so \
commending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we saw the \
shepherd take, expecting every moment that the coast-guard would be down upon \
us. Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had not passed when, \
coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, we perceived some fifty \
mounted men swiftly approaching us at a hand-gallop. As soon as we saw them \
we stood still, waiting for them; but as they came close and, instead of the \
Moors they were in quest of, saw a set of poor Christians, they were taken \
aback, and one of them asked if it could be we who were the cause of the \
shepherd having raised the call to arms. I said \"Yes,\" and as I was about \
to explain to him what had occurred, and whence we came and who we were, one \
of the Christians of our party recognised the horseman who had put the \
question to us, and before I could say anything more he exclaimed: \"Thanks \
be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, if I do not \
deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malaga unless, \
indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable to recollect that you, \
senor, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante, my uncle.\" The Christian \
captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horseman threw himself off \
his horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying: \"Nephew of my soul and \
life! I recognise thee now; and long have I mourned thee as dead, I, and my \
sister, thy mother, and all thy kin that are still alive, and whom God has \
been pleased to preserve that they may enjoy the happiness of seeing thee. We \
knew long since that thou wert in Algiers, and from the appearance of thy \
garments and those of all this company, I conclude that ye have had a \
miraculous restoration to liberty.\" \"It is true,\" replied the young man, \
\"and by-and-by we will tell you all.\" As soon as the horsemen understood \
that we were Christian captives, they dismounted from their horses, and each \
offered his to carry us to the city of Velez Malaga, which was a league and a \
half distant. Some of them went to bring the boat to the city, we having told \
them where we had left it; others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was \
placed on the horse of the young man's uncle. The whole town came out to meet \
us, for they had by this time heard of our arrival from one who had gone on \
in advance. They were not astonished to see liberated captives or captive \
Moors, for people on that coast are well used to see both one and the other; \
but they were astonished at the beauty of Zoraida, which was just then \
heightened, as well by the exertion of travelling as by joy at finding \
herself on Christian soil, and relieved of all fear of being lost; for this \
had brought such a glow upon her face, that unless my affection for her were \
deceiving me, I would venture to say that there was not a more beautiful \
creature in the world--at least, that I had ever seen. We went straight to \
the church to return thanks to God for the mercies we had received, and when \
Zoraida entered it she said there were faces there like Lela Marien's. We \
told her they were her images; and as well as he could the renegade explained \
to her what they meant, that she might adore had received of his brother that \
all who heard him shared in it, showing their sympathy with his sorrow. The \
curate, seeing, then, how well he had succeeded in carrying out his purpose \
and the captain's wishes, had no desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so \
he rose from the table and going into the room where Zoraida was he took her \
by the hand, Luscinda, Dorothea, and the Judge's daughter following her. The \
captain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter, taking \
him with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where the Judge and \
the other gentlemen were and said, \"Let your tears cease to flow, Senor \
Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire, \
for you have before you your worthy brother and your good sister-in-law. He \
whom you see here is the Captain Viedma, and this is the fair Moor who has \
been so good to him. The Frenchmen I told you of have reduced them to the \
state of poverty you see that you may show the generosity of your kind heart.\
\" The captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his \
breast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off but as \
soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms so closely, \
shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those present could not \
but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged, the emotion they showed \
can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less put down in writing. They told \
each other in a few words the events of their lives; they showed the true \
affection of brothers in all its strength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, \
putting all he possessed at her disposal; then he made his daughter embrace \
her, and the fair Christian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every \
eye. And there was Don Quixote observing all these strange proceedings \
attentively without uttering a word, and attributing the whole to chimeras of \
knight-errantry. Then they agreed that the captain and Zoraida should return \
with his brother to Seville, and send news to his father of his having been \
delivered and found, so as to enable him to come and be present at the \
marriage and baptism of Zoraida, for it was impossible for the Judge to put \
off his journey, as he was informed that in a month from that time the fleet \
was to sail from Seville for New Spain, and to miss the passage would have \
been a great inconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and \
glad at the captive's good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night \
were past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. Don \
Quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be attacked \
by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the great treasure \
of beauty the castle contained. Those who understood him returned him thanks \
for this service, and they gave the Judge an account of his extraordinary \
humour, with which he was not a little amused. Sancho Panza alone was fuming \
at the lateness of the hour for retiring to rest; and he of all was the one \
that made himself most comfortable, as he stretched himself on the trappings \
of his ass, which, as will be told farther on, cost him so dear. The ladies, \
then, having retired to their chamber, and the others having disposed \
themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don Quixote sallied out \
of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had promised. It happened, \
however, that a little before the approach of dawn a voice so musical and \
sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it forced them all to listen \
attentively, but especially Dorothea, who had been awake, and by whose side \
Dona Clara de Viedma, for so the Judge's daughter was called, lay sleeping. \
No one could imagine who it was that sang so sweetly, and the voice was \
unaccompanied by any instrument. At one moment it seemed to them as if the \
singer were in the courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were all \
attention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, \"Listen, whoever \
is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer's voice that enchants as it \
chants.\" \"We are listening to it already, senor,\" said Dorothea; on which \
Cardenio went away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, made out \
the words of the song to be these: CHAPTER XLIII. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE \
PLEASANT STORY OF THE MULETEER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER STRANGE THINGS THAT CAME \
TO PASS IN THE INN Ah me, Love's mariner am I On Love's deep ocean sailing; I \
know not where the haven lies, I dare not hope to gain it. One solitary \
distant star Is all I have to guide me, A brighter orb than those of old That \
Palinurus lighted. And vaguely drifting am I borne, I know not where it leads \
me; I fix my gaze on it alone, Of all beside it heedless. But over-cautious \
prudery, And coyness cold and cruel, When most I need it, these, like clouds, \
Its longed-for light refuse me. Bright star, goal of my yearning eyes As thou \
above me beamest, When thou shalt hide thee from my sight I'll know that \
death is near me. The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it \
was not fair to let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her \
from side to side, she woke her, saying: \"Forgive me, child, for waking \
thee, but I do so that thou mayest have the pleasure of hearing the best \
voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps, in all thy life.\" Clara awoke quite \
drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what Dorothea said, asked her \
what it was; she repeated what she had said, and Clara became attentive at \
once; but she had hardly heard two lines, as the singer continued, when a \
strange trembling seized her, as if she were suffering from a severe attack \
of quartan ague, and throwing her arms round Dorothea she said: \"Ah, dear \
lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? The greatest kindness fortune \
could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as neither to see or \
hear that unhappy musician.\" \"What art thou talking about, child?\" said \
Dorothea. \"Why, they say this singer is a muleteer!\" \"Nay, he is the lord \
of many places,\" replied Clara, \"and that one in my heart which he holds so \
firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he be willing to surrender it.\" \
Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed to be \
far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any promise of, \
so she said to her: \"You speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, \
Senora Clara; explain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are \
saying about hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved \
you? But do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I \
get from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports, \
for I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air.\" \"Let \
him, in Heaven's name,\" returned Clara; and not to hear him she stopped both \
ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was again surprised; but turning her \
attention to the song she found that it ran in this fashion: Sweet Hope, my \
stay, That onward to the goal of thy intent Dost make thy way, Heedless of \
hindrance or impediment, Have thou no fear If at each step thou findest death \
is near. No victory, No joy of triumph doth the faint heart know; Unblest is \
he That a bold front to Fortune dares not show, But soul and sense In bondage \
yieldeth up to indolence. If Love his wares Do dearly sell, his right must be \
contest; What gold compares With that whereon his stamp he hath imprest? And \
all men know What costeth little that we rate but low. Love resolute Knows \
not the word \"impossibility;\" And though my suit Beset by endless obstacles \
I see, Yet no despair Shall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there. \
Here the voice ceased and Clara's sobs began afresh, all which excited \
Dorothea's curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so sweet and \
weeping so bitter, so she again asked her what it was she was going to say \
before. On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear her, winding her \
arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to her ear that she could \
speak without fear of being heard by anyone else, and said: \"This singer, \
dear senora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord of two villages, who \
lives opposite my father's house at Madrid; and though my father had curtains \
to the windows of his house in winter, and lattice-work in summer, in some \
way--I know not how--this gentleman, who was pursuing his studies, saw me, \
whether in church or elsewhere, I cannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love \
with me, and gave me to know it from the windows of his house, with so many \
signs and tears that I was forced to believe him, and even to love him, \
without knowing what it was he wanted of me. One of the signs he used to make \
me was to link one hand in the other, to show me he wished to marry me; and \
though I should have been glad if that could be, being alone and motherless I \
knew not whom to open my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showing him no \
favour, except when my father, and his too, were from home, to raise the \
curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly, at which he would \
show such delight that he seemed as if he were going mad. Meanwhile the time \
for my father's departure arrived, which he became aware of, but not from me, \
for I had never been able to tell him of it. He fell sick, of grief I \
believe, and so the day we were going away I could not see him to take \
farewell of him, were it only with the eyes. But after we had been two days \
on the road, on entering the posada of a village a day's journey from this, I \
saw him at the inn door in the dress of a muleteer, and so well disguised, \
that if I did not carry his image graven on my heart it would have been \
impossible for me to recognise him. But I knew him, and I was surprised, and \
glad; he watched me, unsuspected by my father, from whom he always hides \
himself when he crosses my path on the road, or in the posadas where we halt; \
and, as I know what he is, and reflect that for love of me he makes this \
journey on foot in all this hardship, I am ready to die of sorrow; and where \
he sets foot there I set my eyes. I know not with what object he has come; or \
how he could have got away from his father, who loves him beyond measure, \
having no other heir, and because he deserves it, as you will perceive when \
you see him. And moreover, I can tell you, all that he sings is out of his \
own head; for I have heard them say he is a great scholar and poet; and what \
is more, every time I see him or hear him sing I tremble all over, and am \
terrified lest my father should recognise him and come to know of our loves. \
I have never spoken a word to him in my life; and for all that I love him so \
that I could not live without him. This, dear senora, is all I have to tell \
you about the musician whose voice has delighted you so much; and from it \
alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer, but a lord of hearts and \
towns, as I told you already.\" \"Say no more, Dona Clara,\" said Dorothea at \
this, at the same time kissing her a thousand times over, \"say no more, I \
tell you, but wait till day comes; when I trust in God to arrange this affair \
of yours so that it may have the happy ending such an innocent beginning \
deserves.\" \"Ah, senora,\" said Dona Clara, \"what end can be hoped for when \
his father is of such lofty position, and so wealthy, that he would think I \
was not fit to be even a servant to his son, much less wife? And as to \
marrying without the knowledge of my father, I would not do it for all the \
world. I would not ask anything more than that this youth should go back and \
leave me; perhaps with not seeing him, and the long distance we shall have to \
travel, the pain I suffer now may become easier; though I daresay the remedy \
I propose will do me very little good. I don't know how the devil this has \
come about, or how this love I have for him got in; I such a young girl, and \
he such a mere boy; for I verily believe we are both of an age, and I am not \
sixteen yet; for I will be sixteen Michaelmas Day, next, my father says.\" \
Dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Dona Clara spoke. \
\"Let us go to sleep now, senora,\" said she, \"for the little of the night \
that I fancy is left to us: God will soon send us daylight, and we will set \
all to rights, or it will go hard with me.\" With this they fell asleep, and \
deep silence reigned all through the inn. The only persons not asleep were \
the landlady's daughter and her servant Maritornes, who, knowing the weak \
point of Don Quixote's humour, and that he was outside the inn mounting guard \
in armour and on horseback, resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick \
upon him, or at any rate to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his \
nonsense. As it so happened there was not a window in the whole inn that \
looked outwards except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through which they \
used to throw out the straw. At this hole the two demi-damsels posted \
themselves, and observed Don Quixote on his horse, leaning on his pike and \
from time to time sending forth such deep and doleful sighs, that he seemed \
to pluck up his soul by the roots with each of them; and they could hear him, \
too, saying in a soft, tender, loving tone, \"Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, \
perfection of all beauty, summit and crown of discretion, treasure house of \
grace, depositary of virtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good, \
honourable, and delectable in this world! What is thy grace doing now? Art \
thou, perchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own free will hath \
exposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee? Give me tidings of \
her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps at this moment, envious of hers, \
thou art regarding her, either as she paces to and fro some gallery of her \
sumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony, meditating how, whilst \
preserving her purity and greatness, she may mitigate the tortures this \
wretched heart of mine endures for her sake, what glory should recompense my \
sufferings, what repose my toil, and lastly what death my life, and what \
reward my services? And thou, oh sun, that art now doubtless harnessing thy \
steeds in haste to rise betimes and come forth to see my lady; when thou \
seest her I entreat of thee to salute her on my behalf: but have a care, when \
thou shalt see her and salute her, that thou kiss not her face; for I shall \
be more jealous of thee than thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that made \
thee sweat and run so on the plains of Thessaly, or on the banks of the \
Peneus (for I do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run on that \
occasion) in thy jealousy and love.\" Don Quixote had got so far in his \
pathetic speech when the landlady's daughter began to signal to him, saying, \
\"Senor, come over here, please.\" At these signals and voice Don Quixote \
turned his head and saw by the light of the moon, which then was in its full \
splendour, that some one was calling to him from the hole in the wall, which \
seemed to him to be a window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich \
castles, such as he believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately \
suggested itself to his imagination that, as on the former occasion, the fair \
damsel, the daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by love for him, was \
once more endeavouring to win his affections; and with this idea, not to show \
himself discourteous, or ungrateful, he turned Rocinante's head and \
approached the hole, and as he perceived the two wenches he said: \"I pity \
you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your thoughts of love to a \
quarter from whence it is impossible that such a return can be made to you as \
is due to your great merit and gentle birth, for which you must not blame \
this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapable of submission to any \
other than her whom, the first moment his eyes beheld her, he made absolute \
mistress of his soul. Forgive me, noble lady, and retire to your apartment, \
and do not, by any further declaration of your passion, compel me to show \
myself more ungrateful; and if, of the love you bear me, you should find that \
there is anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you, provided it be \
not love itself, demand it of me; for I swear to you by that sweet absent \
enemy of mine to grant it this instant, though it be that you require of me a \
lock of Medusa's hair, which was all snakes, or even the very beams of the \
sun shut up in a vial.\" \"My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir \
knight,\" said Maritornes at this. \"What then, discreet dame, is it that \
your mistress wants?\" replied Don Quixote. \"Only one of your fair hands,\" \
said Maritornes, \"to enable her to vent over it the great passion passion \
which has brought her to this loophole, so much to the risk of her honour; \
for if the lord her father had heard her, the least slice he would cut off \
her would be her ear.\" \"I should like to see that tried,\" said Don \
Quixote; \"but he had better beware of that, if he does not want to meet the \
most disastrous end that ever father in the world met for having laid hands \
on the tender limbs of a love-stricken daughter.\" Maritornes felt sure that \
Don Quixote would present the hand she had asked, and making up her mind what \
to do, she got down from the hole and went into the stable, where she took \
the halter of Sancho Panza's ass, and in all haste returned to the hole, just \
as Don Quixote had planted himself standing on Rocinante's saddle in order to \
reach the grated window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and \
giving her his hand, he said, \"Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge \
of the evil-doers of the earth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand of \
woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of my \
entire body. I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that you may \
observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of the muscles, the \
breadth and capacity of the veins, whence you may infer what must be the \
strength of the arm that has such a hand.\" \"That we shall see presently,\" \
said Maritornes, and making a running knot on the halter, she passed it over \
his wrist and coming down from the hole tied the other end very firmly to the \
bolt of the door of the straw-loft. Don Quixote, feeling the roughness of the \
rope on his wrist, exclaimed, \"Your grace seems to be grating rather than \
caressing my hand; treat it not so harshly, for it is not to blame for the \
offence my resolution has given you, nor is it just to wreak all your \
vengeance on so small a part; remember that one who loves so well should not \
revenge herself so cruelly.\" But there was nobody now to listen to these \
words of Don Quixote's, for as soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the \
other made off, ready to die with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a \
way that it was impossible for him to release himself. He was, as has been \
said, standing on Rocinante, with his arm passed through the hole and his \
wrist tied to the bolt of the door, and in mighty fear and dread of being \
left hanging by the arm if Rocinante were to stir one side or the other; so \
he did not dare to make the least movement, although from the patience and \
imperturbable disposition of Rocinante, he had good reason to expect that he \
would stand without budging for a whole century. Finding himself fast, then, \
and that the ladies had retired, he began to fancy that all this was done by \
enchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same castle that \
enchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him; and he cursed in his heart \
his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the castle again, \
after having come off so badly the first time; it being a settled point with \
knights-errant that when they have tried an adventure, and have not succeeded \
in it, it is a sign that it is not reserved for them but for others, and that \
therefore they need not try it again. Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see \
if he could release himself, but it had been made so fast that all his \
efforts were in vain. It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should \
move, but try as he might to seat himself in the saddle, he had nothing for \
it but to stand upright or pull his hand off. Then it was he wished for the \
sword of Amadis, against which no enchantment whatever had any power; then he \
cursed his ill fortune; then he magnified the loss the world would sustain by \
his absence while he remained there enchanted, for that he believed he was \
beyond all doubt; then he once more took to thinking of his beloved Dulcinea \
del Toboso; then he called to his worthy squire Sancho Panza, who, buried in \
sleep and stretched upon the pack-saddle of his ass, was oblivious, at that \
moment, of the mother that bore him; then he called upon the sages Lirgandeo \
and Alquife to come to his aid; then he invoked his good friend Urganda to \
succour him; and then, at last, morning found him in such a state of \
desperation and perplexity that he was bellowing like a bull, for he had no \
hope that day would bring any relief to his suffering, which he believed \
would last for ever, inasmuch as he was enchanted; and of this he was \
convinced by seeing that Rocinante never stirred, much or little, and he felt \
persuaded that he and his horse were to remain in this state, without eating \
or drinking or sleeping, until the malign influence of the stars was \
overpast, or until some other more sage enchanter should disenchant him. But \
he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had hardly begun \
to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback, well equipped \
and accoutred, with firelocks across their saddle-bows. They called out and \
knocked loudly at the gate of the inn, which was still shut; on seeing which, \
Don Quixote, even there where he was, did not forget to act as sentinel, and \
said in a loud and imperious tone, \"Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, \
ye have no right to knock at the gates of this castle; for it is plain enough \
that they who are within are either asleep, or else are not in the habit of \
throwing open the fortress until the sun's rays are spread over the whole \
surface of the earth. Withdraw to a distance, and wait till it is broad \
daylight, and then we shall see whether it will be proper or not to open to \
you.\" \"What the devil fortress or castle is this,\" said one, \"to make us \
stand on such ceremony? If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us; we are \
travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we are in haste.\" \
\"Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?\" said Don Quixote. \
\"I don't know what you look like,\" replied the other; \"but I know that you \
are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle.\" \"A castle it is,\" \
returned Don Quixote, \"nay, more, one of the best in this whole province, \
and it has within it people who have had the sceptre in the hand and the \
crown on the head.\" \"It would be better if it were the other way,\" said \
the traveller, \"the sceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if \
so, may be there is within some company of players, with whom it is a common \
thing to have those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn \
as this, and where such silence is kept, I do not believe any people entitled \
to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.\" \"You know but \
little of the world,\" returned Don Quixote, \"since you are ignorant of what \
commonly occurs in knight-errantry.\" But the comrades of the spokesman, \
growing weary of the dialogue with Don Quixote, renewed their knocks with \
great vehemence, so much so that the host, and not only he but everybody in \
the inn, awoke, and he got up to ask who knocked. It happened at this moment \
that one of the horses of the four who were seeking admittance went to smell \
Rocinante, who melancholy, dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless, \
supporting his sorely stretched master; and as he was, after all, flesh, \
though he looked as if he were made of wood, he could not help giving way and \
in return smelling the one who had come to offer him attentions. But he had \
hardly moved at all when Don Quixote lost his footing; and slipping off the \
saddle, he would have come to the ground, but for being suspended by the arm, \
which caused him such agony that he believed either his wrist would be cut \
through or his arm torn off; and he hung so near the ground that he could \
just touch it with his feet, which was all the worse for him; for, finding \
how little was wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly, he struggled \
and stretched himself as much as he could to gain a footing; just like those \
undergoing the torture of the strappado, when they are fixed at \"touch and \
no touch,\" who aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to \
stretch themselves, deceived by the hope which makes them fancy that with a \
very little more they will reach the ground. CHAPTER XLIV. IN WHICH ARE \
CONTINUED THE UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURES OF THE INN So loud, in fact, were the \
shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlord opening the gate of the inn in all \
haste, came out in dismay, and ran to see who was uttering such cries, and \
those who were outside joined him. Maritornes, who had been by this time \
roused up by the same outcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, \
without anyone seeing her, untied the halter by which Don Quixote was \
suspended, and down he came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and \
the travellers, who approaching asked him what was the matter with him that \
he shouted so. He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist, and \
rising to his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, put \
his lance in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back \
at a half-gallop exclaiming: \"Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted \
with just cause, provided my lady the Princess Micomicona grants me \
permission to do so, I give him the lie, challenge him and defy him to single \
combat.\" The newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don \
Quixote; but the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, \
and not to mind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked the landlord \
if by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn, \
one dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an appearance, describing \
that of Dona Clara's lover. The landlord replied that there were so many \
people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were inquiring for; but \
one of them observing the coach in which the Judge had come, said, \"He is \
here no doubt, for this is the coach he is following: let one of us stay at \
the gate, and the rest go in to look for him; or indeed it would be as well \
if one of us went round the inn, lest he should escape over the wall of the \
yard.\" \"So be it,\" said another; and while two of them went in, one \
remained at the gate and the other made the circuit of the inn; observing all \
which, the landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking \
all these precautions, though he understood they were looking for the youth \
whose description they had given him. It was by this time broad daylight; and \
for that reason, as well as in consequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, \
everybody was awake and up, but particularly Dona Clara and Dorothea; for \
they had been able to got your permission my master will be in the other \
world.\" \"Give me leave, senora, to obtain the permission I speak of,\" \
returned Don Quixote; \"and if I get it, it will matter very little if he is \
in the other world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same \
world can do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those who \
shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately satisfied;\" \
and without saying anything more he went and knelt before Dorothea, \
requesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be pleased to grant \
him permission to aid and succour the castellan of that castle, who now stood \
in grievous jeopardy. The princess granted it graciously, and he at once, \
bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing his sword, hastened to the \
inn-gate, where the two guests were still handling the landlord roughly; but \
as soon as he reached the spot he stopped short and stood still, though \
Maritornes and the landlady asked him why he hesitated to help their master \
and husband. \"I hesitate,\" said Don Quixote, \"because it is not lawful for \
me to draw sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire \
Sancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business.\" \
Thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively exchange of \
fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord and to the wrath \
of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who were furious when they saw \
the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the hard treatment their master, \
husband and father was undergoing. But let us leave him there; for he will \
surely find some one to help him, and if not, let him suffer and hold his \
tongue who attempts more than his strength allows him to do; and let us go \
back fifty paces to see what Don Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left \
questioning him privately as to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly \
dressed. To which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart \
was troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made \
answer: \"Senor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when, \
through heaven's will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Dona Clara, \
your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the mistress of my \
will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no impediment, this very \
day she shall become my wife. For her I left my father's house, and for her I \
assumed this disguise, to follow her whithersoever she may go, as the arrow \
seeks its mark or the sailor the pole-star. She knows nothing more of my \
passion than what she may have learned from having sometimes seen from a \
distance that my eyes were filled with tears. You know already, senor, the \
wealth and noble birth of my parents, and that I am their sole heir; if this \
be a sufficient inducement for you to venture to make me completely happy, \
accept me at once as your son; for if my father, influenced by other objects \
of his own, should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself, \
time has more power to alter and change things, than human will.\" With this \
the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, after hearing him, was \
astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at the manner and intelligence \
with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of his heart, as at the position \
in which he found himself, not knowing what course to take in a matter so \
sudden and unexpected. All the answer, therefore, he gave him was to bid him \
to make his mind easy for the present, and arrange with his servants not to \
take him back that day, so that there might be time to consider what was best \
for all parties. Don Luis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with \
his tears, in a way that would have touched a heart of marble, not to say \
that of the Judge, who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how \
advantageous the marriage would be to his daughter; though, were it possible, \
he would have preferred that it should be brought about with the consent of \
the father of Don Luis, who he knew looked for a title for his son. The \
guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by persuasion and \
Don Quixote's fair words more than by threats, they had paid him what he \
demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting for the end of the \
conversation with the Judge and their master's decision, when the devil, who \
never sleeps, contrived that the barber, from whom Don Quixote had taken \
Mambrino's helmet, and Sancho Panza the trappings of his ass in exchange for \
those of his own, should at this instant enter the inn; which said barber, as \
he led his ass to the stable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing \
something or other belonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he \
knew it, and made bold to attack Sancho, exclaiming, \"Ho, sir thief, I have \
caught you! hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that \
you robbed me of.\" Sancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and \
hearing the abuse poured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and \
with the other gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The \
barber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the \
pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that everyone in the \
inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant. \"Here, in the \
name of the king and justice!\" he cried, \"this thief and highwayman wants \
to kill me for trying to recover my property.\" \"You lie,\" said Sancho, \"I \
am no highwayman; it was in fair war my master Don Quixote won these \
spoils.\" Don Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his \
squire's stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time forth he \
reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub him a knight \
on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling sure that the order \
of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him. In the course of the \
altercation, among other things the barber said, \"Gentlemen, this \
pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death, and I know it as well as \
if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass in the stable who will not let \
me lie; only try it, and if it does not fit him like a glove, call me a \
rascal; and what is more, the same day I was robbed of this, they robbed me \
likewise of a new brass basin, never yet handselled, that would fetch a crown \
any day.\" At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and \
interposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the pack-saddle \
on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was established, and \
said, \"Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which \
this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which was, is, and shall be the \
helmet of Mambrino which I won from him in air war, and made myself master of \
by legitimate and lawful possession. With the pack-saddle I do not concern \
myself; but I may tell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my \
permission to strip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon's steed, \
and with it adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its \
having been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no \
explanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take place \
in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho my son, and \
fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.\" \"Egad, \
master,\" said Sancho, \"if we have no other proof of our case than what your \
worship puts forward, Mambrino's helmet is just as much a basin as this good \
fellow's caparison is a pack-saddle.\" \"Do as I bid thee,\" said Don \
Quixote; \"it cannot be that everything in this castle goes by enchantment.\" \
Sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him, and \
when Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said: \"Your worships may see \
with what a face this squire can assert that this is a basin and not the \
helmet I told you of; and I swear by the order of chivalry I profess, that \
this helmet is the identical one I took from him, without anything added to \
or taken from it.\" \"There is no doubt of that,\" said Sancho, \"for from \
the time my master won it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when \
he let loose those unlucky men in chains; and if had not been for this \
basin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time, for there was \
plenty of stone-throwing in that affair.\" CHAPTER XLV. IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL \
QUESTION OF MAMBRINO'S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH \
OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST \"What do you think now, \
gentlemen,\" said the barber, \"of what these gentles say, when they want to \
make out that this is a helmet?\" \"And whoever says the contrary,\" said Don \
Quixote, \"I will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a \
squire that he lies again a thousand times.\" Our own barber, who was present \
at all this, and understood Don Quixote's humour so thoroughly, took it into \
his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general \
amusement; so addressing the other barber he said: \"Senor barber, or \
whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and \
have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the \
implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was \
likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also \
what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other \
things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers' arms; and I \
say-saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder \
judgments--that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman \
has in his hands, not only is no barber's basin, but is as far from being one \
as white is from black, and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, \
although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.\" \"Certainly not,\" said \
Don Quixote, \"for half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.\" \"It \
is quite true,\" said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the \
barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and \
even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis's affair, \
would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the \
serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to \
these facetious proceedings. \"God bless me!\" exclaimed their butt the \
barber at this; \"is it possible that such an honourable company can say that \
this is not a basin but a helmet? Why, this is a thing that would astonish a \
whole university, however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a \
helmet, why, then the pack-saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this \
gentleman has said.\" \"To me it looks like a pack-saddle,\" said Don \
Quixote; \"but I have already said that with that question I do not concern \
myself.\" \"As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,\" said the curate, \
\"it is only for Senor Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry \
all these gentlemen and I bow to his authority.\" \"By God, gentlemen,\" said \
Don Quixote, \"so many strange things have happened to me in this castle on \
the two occasions on which I have sojourned in it, that I will not venture to \
assert anything positively in reply to any question touching anything it \
contains; for it is my belief that everything that goes on within it goes by \
enchantment. The first time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me \
sore trouble, nor did Sancho fare well among certain followers of his; and \
last night I was kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without \
knowing how or why I came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come \
forward to give an opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash \
decision. As regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a helmet I \
have already given an answer; but as to the question whether this is a \
pack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give a positive opinion, but \
will leave it to your worships' better judgment. Perhaps as you are not \
dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of this place have nothing to do \
with you, and your faculties are unfettered, and you can see things in this \
castle as they really and truly are, and not as they appear to me.\" \"There \
can be no question,\" said Don Fernando on this, \"but that Senor Don Quixote \
has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision of this matter; \
and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will take the votes of the \
gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly and fully.\" To those who \
were in the secret of Don Quixote's humour all this afforded great amusement; \
but to those who knew nothing about it, it seemed the greatest nonsense in \
the world, in particular to the four servants of Don Luis, as well as to Don \
Luis himself, and to three other travellers who had by chance come to the \
inn, and had the appearance of officers of the Holy Brotherhood, as indeed \
they were; but the one who above all was at his wits' end, was the barber \
basin, there before his very eyes, had been turned into Mambrino's helmet, \
and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt whatever was about to become a rich \
caparison for a horse. All laughed to see Don Fernando going from one to \
another collecting the votes, and whispering to them to give him their \
private opinion whether the treasure over which there had been so much \
fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison; but after he had taken the votes \
of those who knew Don Quixote, he said aloud, \"The fact is, my good fellow, \
that I am tired collecting such a number of opinions, for I find that there \
is not one of whom I ask what I desire to know, who does not tell me that it \
is absurd to say that this is the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the \
caparison of a horse, nay, of a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, \
in spite of you and your ass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you \
have stated and proved your case very badly.\" \"May I never share heaven,\" \
said the poor barber, \"if your worships are not all mistaken; and may my \
soul appear before God as that appears to me a pack-saddle and not a \
caparison; but, 'laws go,'-I say no more; and indeed I am not drunk, for I am \
fasting, except it be from sin.\" The simple talk of the barber did not \
afford less amusement than the absurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed: \
\"There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to him, \
and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.\" But said one \
of the four servants, \"Unless, indeed, this is a deliberate joke, I cannot \
bring myself to believe that men so intelligent as those present are, or seem \
to be, can venture to declare and assert that this is not a basin, and that \
not a pack-saddle; but as I perceive that they do assert and declare it, I \
can only come to the conclusion that there is some mystery in this \
persistence in what is so opposed to the evidence of experience and truth \
itself; for I swear by\"--and here he rapped out a round oath-\"all the \
people in the world will not make me believe that this is not a barber's \
basin and that a jackass's pack-saddle.\" \"It might easily be a she-ass's,\" \
observed the curate. \"It is all the same,\" said the servant; \"that is not \
the point; but whether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.\" \
On hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood, who had \
been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to restrain his anger \
and impatience, exclaimed, \"It is a pack-saddle as sure as my father is my \
father, and whoever has said or will say anything else must be drunk.\" \"You \
lie like a rascally clown,\" returned Don Quixote; and lifting his pike, \
which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow at his head \
that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have stretched him at full \
length. The pike was shivered in pieces against the ground, and the rest of \
the officers, seeing their comrade assaulted, raised a shout, calling for \
help for the Holy Brotherhood. The landlord, who was of the fraternity, ran \
at once to fetch his staff of office and his sword, and ranged himself on the \
side of his comrades; the servants of Don Luis clustered round him, lest he \
should escape from them in the confusion; the barber, seeing the house turned \
upside down, once more laid hold of his pack-saddle and Sancho did the same; \
Don Quixote drew his sword and charged the officers; Don Luis cried out to \
his servants to leave him alone and go and help Don Quixote, and Cardenio and \
Don Fernando, who were supporting him; the curate was shouting at the top of \
his voice, the landlady was screaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes \
was weeping, Dorothea was aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Dona Clara in \
a faint. The barber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don \
Luis gave one of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep \
him from escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took his \
part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was belabouring him \
heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling for help for the Holy \
Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing but cries, shouts, shrieks, \
confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps, sword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, \
kicks, and bloodshed; and in the midst of all this chaos, complication, and \
general entanglement, Don Quixote took it into his head that he had been \
plunged into the thick of the discord of Agramante's camp; and, in a voice \
that shook the inn like thunder, he cried out: \"Hold all, let all sheathe \
their swords, let all be calm and attend to me as they value their lives!\" \
All paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, \"Did I not tell you, \
sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of devils dwelt \
in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with your own eyes how the \
discord of Agramante's camp has come hither, and been transferred into the \
midst of us. See how they fight, there for the sword, here for the horse, on \
that side for the eagle, on this for the helmet; we are all fighting, and all \
at cross purposes. Come then, you, Senor Judge, and you, senor curate; let \
the one represent King Agramante and the other King Sobrino, and make peace \
among us; for by God Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of \
quality as we are should slay one another for such trifling cause.\" The \
officers, who did not understand Don Quixote's mode of speaking, and found \
themselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their companions, \
were not to be appeased; the barber was, however, for both his beard and his \
pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle; Sancho like a good servant \
obeyed the slightest word of his master; while the four servants of Don Luis \
kept quiet when they saw how little they gained by not being so. The landlord \
alone insisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this madman, \
who at every turn raised a disturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar \
was stilled for the present; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the \
day of judgment, and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote's \
imagination. All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion \
of the Judge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him \
to return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter with \
them, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the curate as \
to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it stood, and what Don \
Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length that Don Fernando should tell \
the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that it was his desire that Don Luis \
should accompany him to Andalusia, where he would receive from the marquis \
his brother the welcome his quality entitled him to; for, otherwise, it was \
easy to see from the determination of Don Luis that he would not return to \
his father at present, though they tore him to pieces. On learning the rank \
of Don Fernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it \
between themselves that three of them should return to tell his father how \
matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon Don Luis, and \
not leave him until they came back for him, or his father's orders were \
known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of King Sobrino all \
this complication of disputes was arranged; but the enemy of concord and \
hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made a fool of, and seeing how \
little he had gained after having involved them all in such an elaborate \
entanglement, resolved to try his hand once more by stirring up fresh \
quarrels and disturbances. It came about in this wise: the officers were \
pacified on learning the rank of those with whom they had been engaged, and \
withdrew from the contest, considering that whatever the result might be they \
were likely to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had \
been thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some \
warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one against \
Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting \
the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason, apprehended. \
Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to satisfy himself as to whether Don \
Quixote's features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of his bosom he \
lit upon what he was in search of, and setting himself to read it \
deliberately, for he was not a quick reader, as he made out each word he \
fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and went on comparing the description in the \
warrant with his face, and discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person \
described in it. As soon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the \
parchment, he took the warrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don \
Quixote by the collar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and \
shouted aloud, \"Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand \
it in earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be \
arrested.\" The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said \
was true, and that it agreed with Don Quixote's appearance, who, on his part, \
when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown, worked up to \
the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking with rage, with both \
hands seized the officer by the throat with all his might, so that had he not \
been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere Don Quixote \
released his hold. The landlord, who had perforce to support his brother \
officers, ran at once to aid them. The landlady, when she saw her husband \
engaged in a fresh quarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was \
immediately caught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling upon heaven and \
all present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, \"By \
the Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments of this \
castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!\" Don Fernando \
parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual contentment made them \
relax the grip by which they held, the one the coat collar, the other the \
throat of his adversary; for all this, however, the officers did not cease to \
demand their prisoner and call on them to help, and deliver him over bound \
into their power, as was required for the service of the King and of the Holy \
Brotherhood, on whose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect \
the capture of this robber and footpad of the highways. Don Quixote smiled \
when he heard these words, and said very calmly, \"Come now, base, ill-born \
brood; call ye it highway robbery to give freedom to those in bondage, to \
release the captives, to succour the miserable, to raise up the fallen, to \
relieve the needy? Infamous beings, who by your vile grovelling intellects \
deserve that heaven should not make known to you the virtue that lies in \
knight-errantry, or show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye \
refuse to respect the shadow, not to say the presence, of any knight-errant! \
Come now; band, not of officers, but of thieves; footpads with the licence of \
the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of \
arrest against such a knight as I am? Who was he that did not know that \
knights-errant are independent of all jurisdictions, that their law is their \
sword, their charter their prowess, and their edicts their will? Who, I say \
again, was the fool that knows not that there are no letters patent of \
nobility that confer such privileges or exemptions as a knight-errant \
acquires the day he is dubbed a knight, and devotes himself to the arduous \
calling of chivalry? What knight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen's \
pin-money, king's dues, toll or ferry? What tailor ever took payment of him \
for making his clothes? What castellan that received him in his castle ever \
made him pay his shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What damsel \
was not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and \
pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there, or will \
there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give, single-handed, four \
hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhood if they \
come in his way?\" CHAPTER XLVI. OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE \
OFFICERS OF THE HOLY BROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY \
KNIGHT, DON QUIXOTE While Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate \
was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as \
they might perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not press \
the matter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried him off, \
they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which the holder of \
the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into Don \
Quixote's madness, but only to execute his superior's orders, and that once \
taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked. \"For all \
that,\" said the curate, \"you must not take him away this time, nor will he, \
it is my opinion, let himself be taken away.\" In short, the curate used such \
arguments, and Don Quixote did such mad things, that the officers would have \
been more mad than he was if they had not perceived his want of wits, and so \
they thought it best to allow themselves to be pacified, and even to act as \
peacemakers between the barber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their \
altercation with much bitterness. In the end they, as officers of justice, \
settled the question by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if \
not perfectly contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they changed \
the pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to Mambrino's \
helmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote's knowing it, paid \
eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a full receipt and \
engagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for evermore, amen. \
These two disputes, which were the most important and gravest, being settled, \
it only remained for the servants of Don Luis to consent that three of them \
should return while one was left to accompany him whither Don Fernando \
desired to take him; and good luck and better fortune, having already begun \
to solve difficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and \
warriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bring everything to a \
happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; which gave \
Dona Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her face just \
then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida, though she did not fully \
comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay without knowing why, as she watched \
and studied the various countenances, but particularly her Spaniard's, whom \
she followed with her eyes and clung to with her soul. The gift and \
compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the landlord's \
notice, and he demanded Don Quixote's reckoning, together with the amount of \
the damage to his wine-skins, and the loss of his wine, swearing that neither \
Rocinante nor Sancho's ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the \
very last farthing. The curate settled all amicably, and Don Fernando paid; \
though the Judge had also very readily offered to pay the score; and all \
became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded one of the \
discord of Agramante's camp, as Don Quixote said, but of the peace and \
tranquillity of the days of Octavianus: for all which it was the universal \
opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the \
curate, and to the unexampled generosity of Don Fernando. Finding himself now \
clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire's as well as his own, Don Quixote \
considered that it would be advisable to continue the journey he had begun, \
and bring to a close that great adventure for which he had been called and \
chosen; and with this high resolve he went and knelt before Dorothea, who, \
however, would not allow him to utter a word until he had risen; so to obey \
her he rose, and said, \"It is a common proverb, fair lady, that 'diligence \
is the mother of good fortune,' and experience has often shown in important \
affairs that the earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case to a \
successful termination; but in nothing does this truth show itself more \
plainly than in war, where quickness and activity forestall the devices of \
the enemy, and win the victory before the foe has time to defend himself. All \
this I say, exalted and esteemed lady, because it seems to me that for us to \
remain any longer in this castle now is useless, and may be injurious to us \
in a way that we shall find out some day; for who knows but that your enemy \
the giant may have learned by means of secret and diligent spies that I am \
going to destroy him, and if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to \
fortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold, against which all \
my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little? \
Therefore, lady, let us, as I say, forestall his schemes by our activity, and \
let us depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is only \
kept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay in \
encountering your adversary.\" Don Quixote held his peace and said no more, \
calmly awaiting the reply of the beauteous princess, who, with commanding \
dignity and in a style adapted to Don Quixote's own, replied to him in these \
words, \"I give you thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good \
knight to whom it is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the \
needy, display to afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that \
your wishes and mine may be realised, so that you may see that there are \
women in this world capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it be \
forthwith, for I have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in accordance \
with your good pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of \
her person, and placed in your hands the recovery of her dominions, must not \
think of offering opposition to that which your wisdom may ordain.\" \"On, \
then, in God's name,\" said Don Quixote; \"for, when a lady humbles herself \
to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and placing her on \
the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, for the common saying \
that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my eagerness to take the road; \
and as neither heaven has created nor hell seen any that can daunt or \
intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, and get ready thy ass and the \
queen's palfrey, and let us take leave of the castellan and these gentlemen, \
and go hence this very instant.\" Sancho, who was standing by all the time, \
said, shaking his head, \"Ah! master, master, there is more mischief in the \
village than one hears of, begging all good bodies' pardon.\" \"What mischief \
can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the world, you booby, \
that can hurt my reputation?\" said Don Quixote. \"If your worship is \
angry,\" replied Sancho, \"I will hold my tongue and leave unsaid what as a \
good squire I am bound to say, and what a good servant should tell his \
master.\" \"Say what thou wilt,\" returned Don Quixote, \"provided thy words \
be not meant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving \
like thyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.\" \"It is nothing of the \
sort, as I am a sinner before God,\" said Sancho, \"but that I take it to be \
sure and certain that this lady, who calls herself queen of the great kingdom \
of Micomicon, is no more so than my mother; for, if she was what she says, \
she would not go rubbing noses with one that is here every instant and behind \
every door.\" Dorothea turned red at Sancho's words, for the truth was that \
her husband Don Fernando had now and then, when the others were not looking, \
gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned, and Sancho \
seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a \
queen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable or not caring to answer \
him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued, \"This I say, senor, because, \
if after we have travelled roads and highways, and passed bad nights and \
worse days, one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to reap the fruit \
of our labours, there is no need for me to be in a hurry to saddle Rocinante, \
put the pad on the ass, or get ready the palfrey; for it will be better for \
us to stay quiet, and let every jade mind her spinning, and let us go to \
dinner.\" Good God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard the \
audacious words of his squire! So great was it, that in a voice inarticulate \
with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed living fire, he \
exclaimed, \"Rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and ignorant, ill-spoken, \
foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer! Hast thou dared to utter such \
words in my presence and in that of these illustrious ladies? Hast thou dared \
to harbour such gross and shameless thoughts in thy muddled imagination? \
Begone from my presence, thou born monster, storehouse of lies, hoard of \
untruths, garner of knaveries, inventor of scandals, publisher of \
absurdities, enemy of the respect due to royal personages! Begone, show \
thyself no more before me under pain of my wrath;\" and so saying he knitted \
his brows, puffed out his cheeks, gazed around him, and stamped on the ground \
violently with his right foot, showing in every way the rage that was pent up \
in his heart; and at his words and furious gestures Sancho was so scared and \
terrified that he would have been glad if the earth had opened that instant \
and swallowed him, and his only thought was to turn round and make his escape \
from the angry presence of his master. But the ready-witted Dorothea, who by \
this time so well understood Don Quixote's humour, said, to mollify his \
wrath, \"Be not irritated at the absurdities your good squire has uttered, \
Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, for perhaps he did not utter them \
without cause, and from his good sense and Christian conscience it is not \
likely that he would bear false witness against anyone. We may therefore \
believe, without any hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, \
everything in this castle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, \
Sancho, I say, may possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what \
he says he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty.\" \"I swear by God \
Omnipotent,\" exclaimed Don Quixote at this, \"your highness has hit the \
point; and that some vile illusion must have come before this sinner of a \
Sancho, that made him see what it would have been impossible to see by any \
other means than enchantments; for I know well enough, from the poor fellow's \
goodness and harmlessness, that he is incapable of bearing false witness \
against anybody.\" \"True, no doubt,\" said Don Fernando, \"for which reason, \
Senor Don Quixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of \
your favour, sicut erat in principio, before illusions of this sort had taken \
away his senses.\" Don Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the \
curate went for Sancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees \
begged for the hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed \
him to kiss it, gave him his blessing and said, \"Now, Sancho my son, thou \
wilt be convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee, that \
everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.\" \"So it is, I \
believe,\" said Sancho, \"except the affair of the blanket, which came to \
pass in reality by ordinary means.\" \"Believe it not,\" said Don Quixote, \
\"for had it been so, I would have avenged thee that instant, or even now; \
but neither then nor now could I, nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge \
thy wrong.\" They were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, \
and the landlord gave them a minute account of Sancho's flights, at which \
they laughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out of \
countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all enchantment. \
For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitch that he could \
persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth, without any deception \
whatever about it, that he had been blanketed by beings of flesh and blood, \
and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms, as his master believed and \
protested. The illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as \
it seemed to them time to depart, they devised a plan so that, without giving \
Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don Quixote to his \
village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona, the curate and the \
barber might carry him away with them as they proposed, and the curate be \
able to take his madness in hand at home; and in pursuance of their plan they \
arranged with the owner of an oxcart who happened to be passing that way to \
carry him after this fashion. They constructed a kind of cage with wooden \
bars, large enough to hold Don Quixote comfortably; and then Don Fernando and \
his companions, the servants of Don Luis, and the officers of the \
Brotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directions and advice of the \
curate, covered their faces and disguised themselves, some in one way, some \
in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quite different from the persons \
he had seen in the castle. This done, in profound silence they entered the \
room where he was asleep, taking his his rest after the past frays, and \
advancing to where he was sleeping tranquilly, not dreaming of anything of \
the kind happening, they seized him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, \
so that, when he awoke startled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel \
and wonder at the strange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once \
gave way to the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before \
him, and took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the \
enchanted castle, and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as he \
could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the curate, the concoctor \
of the scheme, expected would happen. Of all that were there Sancho was the \
only one who was at once in his senses and in his own proper character, and \
he, though he was within very little of sharing his master's infirmity, did \
not fail to perceive who all these disguised figures were; but he did not \
dare to open his lips until he saw what came of this assault and capture of \
his master; nor did the latter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of his \
mishap; which was that bringing in the cage, they shut him up in it and \
nailed the bars so firmly that they could not be easily burst open. They then \
took him on their shoulders, and as they passed out of the room an awful \
voice--as much so as the barber, not he of the pack-saddle but the other, was \
able to make it--was heard to say, \"O Knight of the Rueful Countenance, let \
not this captivity in which thou art placed afflict thee, for this must needs \
be, for the more speedy accomplishment of the adventure in which thy great \
heart has engaged thee; the which shall be accomplished when the raging \
Manchegan lion and the white Tobosan dove shall be linked together, having \
first humbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony. And from \
this marvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world brave whelps \
that shall rival the ravening claws of their valiant father; and this shall \
come to pass ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall in his swift natural \
course have twice visited the starry signs. And thou, O most noble and \
obedient squire that ever bore sword at side, beard on face, or nose to smell \
with, be not dismayed or grieved to see the flower of knight-errantry carried \
away thus before thy very eyes; for soon, if it so please the Framer of the \
universe, thou shalt see thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not \
know thyself, and the promises which thy good master has made thee shall not \
prove false; and I assure thee, on the authority of the sage Mentironiana, \
that thy wages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season. Follow \
then the footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedient that \
thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and as it is not \
permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return to that place I \
wot of;\" and as he brought the prophecy to a close he raised his voice to a \
high pitch, and then lowered it to such a soft tone, that even those who knew \
it was all a joke were almost inclined to take what they heard seriously. Don \
Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at once comprehended \
its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to him that he should \
see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with his beloved Dulcinea del \
Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed the whelps, his sons, to the \
eternal glory of La Mancha; and being thoroughly and firmly persuaded of \
this, he lifted up his voice, and with a deep sigh exclaimed, \"Oh thou, \
whoever thou art, who hast foretold me so much good, I implore of thee that \
on my part thou entreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests, \
that he leave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now \
carrying me away, ere I see fulfilled promises so joyful and incomparable as \
those which have been now made me; for, let this but come to pass, and I \
shall glory in the pains of my prison, find comfort in these chains wherewith \
they bind me, and regard this bed whereon they stretch me, not as a hard \
battle-field, but as a soft and happy nuptial couch; and touching the \
consolation of Sancho Panza, my squire, I rely upon his goodness and \
rectitude that he will not desert me in good or evil fortune; for if, by his \
ill luck or mine, it may not happen to be in my power to give him the island \
I have promised, or any equivalent for it, at least his wages shall not be \
lost; for in my will, which is already made, I have declared the sum that \
shall be paid to him, measured, not by his many faithful services, but by the \
means at my disposal.\" Sancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed \
both his hands, for, being tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the \
apparitions lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the \
ox-cart. CHAPTER XLVII. OF THE STRANGE MANNER IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE OF LA \
MANCHA WAS CARRIED AWAY ENCHANTED, TOGETHER WITH OTHER REMARKABLE INCIDENTS \
When Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way, he \
said, \"Many grave histories of knights-errant have I read; but never yet \
have I read, seen, or heard of their carrying off enchanted knights-errant in \
this fashion, or at the slow pace that these lazy, sluggish animals promise; \
for they always take them away through the air with marvellous swiftness, \
enveloped in a dark thick cloud, or on a chariot of fire, or it may be on \
some hippogriff or other beast of the kind; but to carry me off like this on \
an ox-cart! By God, it puzzles me! But perhaps the chivalry and enchantments \
of our day take a different course from that of those in days gone by; and it \
may be, too, that as I am a new knight in the world, and the first to revive \
the already forgotten calling of knight-adventurers, they may have newly \
invented other kinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying off the \
enchanted. What thinkest thou of the matter, Sancho my son?\" \"I don't know \
what to think,\" answered Sancho, \"not being as well read as your worship in \
errant writings; but for all that I venture to say and swear that these \
apparitions that are about us are not quite catholic.\" \"Catholic!\" said \
Don Quixote. \"Father of me! how can they be Catholic when they are all \
devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and do this, and bring me to \
this condition? And if thou wouldst prove it, touch them, and feel them, and \
thou wilt find they have only bodies of air, and no consistency except in \
appearance.\" \"By God, master,\" returned Sancho, \"I have touched them \
already; and that devil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh, and \
another property very different from what I have heard say devils have, for \
by all accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells; but this \
one smells of amber half a league off.\" Sancho was here speaking of Don \
Fernando, who, like a gentleman of his rank, was very likely perfumed as \
Sancho said. \"Marvel not at that, Sancho my friend,\" said Don Quixote; \
\"for let me tell thee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours \
about with them, they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or, \
if they have any smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but of something \
foul and fetid; and the reason is that as they carry hell with them wherever \
they go, and can get no ease whatever from their torments, and as a sweet \
smell is a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment, it is impossible that \
they can smell sweet; if, then, this devil thou speakest of seems to thee to \
smell of amber, either thou art deceiving thyself, or he wants to deceive \
thee by making thee fancy he is not a devil.\" Such was the conversation that \
passed between master and man; and Don Fernando and Cardenio, apprehensive of \
Sancho's making a complete discovery of their scheme, towards which he had \
already gone some way, resolved to hasten their departure, and calling the \
landlord aside, they directed him to saddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle \
on Sancho's ass, which he did with great alacrity. In the meantime the curate \
had made an arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company \
as far as his village, he paying them so much a day. Cardenio hung the \
buckler on one side of the bow of Rocinante's saddle and the basin on the \
other, and by signs commanded Sancho to mount his ass and take Rocinante's \
bridle, and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their \
muskets; but before the cart was put in motion, out came the landlady and her \
daughter and Maritornes to bid Don Quixote farewell, pretending to weep with \
grief at his misfortune; and to them Don Quixote said: \"Weep not, good \
ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those who follow the profession \
I profess; and if these reverses did not befall me I should not esteem myself \
a famous knight-errant; for such things never happen to knights of little \
renown and fame, because nobody in the world thinks about them; to valiant \
knights they do, for these are envied for their virtue and valour by many \
princes and other knights who compass the destruction of the worthy by base \
means. Nevertheless, virtue is of herself so mighty, that, in spite of all \
the magic that Zoroaster its first inventor knew, she will come victorious \
out of every trial, and shed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon \
the heavens. Forgive me, fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have in \
aught offended you; for intentionally and wittingly I have never done so to \
any; and pray to God that he deliver me from this captivity to which some \
malevolent enchanter has consigned me; and should I find myself released \
therefrom, the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in this castle shall be \
held in memory by me, that I may acknowledge, recognise, and requite them as \
they deserve.\" While this was passing between the ladies of the castle and \
Don Quixote, the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and his \
companions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now all made happy, \
and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They all embraced one another, \
and promised to let each other know how things went with them, and Don \
Fernando directed the curate where to write to him, to tell him what became \
of Don Quixote, assuring him that there was nothing that could give him more \
pleasure than to hear of it, and that he too, on his part, would send him \
word of everything he thought he would like to know, about his marriage, \
Zoraida's baptism, Don Luis's affair, and Luscinda's return to her home. The \
curate promised to comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once \
more, and renewed their promises. The landlord approached the curate and \
handed him some papers, saying he had discovered them in the lining of the \
valise in which the novel of \"The Ill-advised Curiosity\" had been found, \
and that he might take them all away with him as their owner had not since \
returned; for, as he could not read, he did not want them himself. The curate \
thanked him, and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the \
words, \"Novel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,\" by which he perceived that it \
was a novel, and as that of \"The Ill-advised Curiosity\" had been good he \
concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably by the same \
author; so he kept it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. He \
then mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not \
to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the \
cart. The order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner leading \
it; at each side of it marched the officers of the Brotherhood, as has been \
said, with their muskets; then followed Sancho Panza on his ass, leading \
Rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and the barber on \
their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and a grave and serious \
air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the oxen. Don Quixote was \
seated in the cage, with his hands tied and his feet stretched out, leaning \
against the bars as silent and as patient as if he were a stone statue and \
not a man of flesh. Thus slowly and silently they made, it might be, two \
leagues, until they reached a valley which the carter thought a convenient \
place for resting and feeding his oxen, and he said so to the curate, but the \
barber was of opinion that they ought to push on a little farther, as at the \
other side of a hill which appeared close by he knew there was a valley that \
had more grass and much better than the one where they proposed to halt; and \
his advice was taken and they continued their journey. Just at that moment \
the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind them six or seven mounted men, \
well found and equipped, who soon overtook them, for they were travelling, \
not at the sluggish, deliberate pace of oxen, but like men who rode canons' \
mules, and in haste to take their noontide rest as soon as possible at the \
inn which was in sight not a league off. The quick travellers came up with \
the slow, and courteous salutations were exchanged; and one of the new \
comers, who was, in fact, a canon of Toledo and master of the others who \
accompanied him, observing the regular order of the procession, the cart, the \
officers, Sancho, Rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all Don \
Quixote caged and confined, could not help asking what was the meaning of \
carrying the man in that fashion; though, from the badges of the officers, he \
already concluded that he must be some desperate highwayman or other \
malefactor whose punishment fell within the jurisdiction of the Holy \
Brotherhood. One of the officers to whom he had put the question, replied, \
\"Let the gentleman himself tell you the meaning of his going this way, \
senor, for we do not know.\" Don Quixote overheard the conversation and said, \
\"Haply, gentlemen, you are versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? \
Because if you are I will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good \
in my giving myself the trouble of relating them;\" but here the curate and \
the barber, seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation with Don \
Quixote, came forward, in order to answer in such a way as to save their \
stratagem from being discovered. The canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, \
\"In truth, brother, I know more about books of chivalry than I do about \
Villalpando's elements of logic; so if that be all, you may safely tell me \
what you please.\" \"In God's name, then, senor,\" replied Don Quixote; \"if \
that be so, I would have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by \
the envy and fraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the \
wicked than loved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one of those \
whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in her record, but of \
those who, in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and all the magicians \
that Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever \
produced, will place their names in the temple of immortality, to serve as \
examples and patterns for ages to come, whereby knights-errant may see the \
footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit and \
crowning point of honour in arms.\" \"What Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha \
says,\" observed the curate, \"is the truth; for he goes enchanted in this \
cart, not from any fault or sins of his, but because of the malevolence of \
those to whom virtue is odious and valour hateful. This, senor, is the Knight \
of the Rueful Countenance, if you have ever heard him named, whose valiant \
achievements and mighty deeds shall be written on lasting brass and \
imperishable marble, notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure them \
and malice to hide them.\" When the canon heard both the prisoner and the man \
who was at liberty talk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his \
astonishment, and could not make out what had befallen him; and all his \
attendants were in the same state of amazement. At this point Sancho Panza, \
who had drawn near to hear the conversation, said, in order to make \
everything plain, \"Well, sirs, you may like or dislike what I am going to \
say, but the fact of the matter is, my master, Don Quixote, is just as much \
enchanted as my mother. He is in his full senses, he eats and he drinks, and \
he has his calls like other men and as he had yesterday, before they caged \
him. And if that's the case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that \
he is enchanted? For I have heard many a one say that enchanted people \
neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master, if you don't stop him, will \
talk more than thirty lawyers.\" Then turning to the curate he exclaimed, \
\"Ah, senor curate, senor curate! do you think I don't know you? Do you think \
I don't guess and see the drift of these new enchantments? Well then, I can \
tell you I know you, for all your face is covered, and I can tell you I am up \
to you, however you may hide your tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue \
cannot live, and where there is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill \
betide the devil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be \
married to the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at \
least; for no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my \
master, him of the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my services. \
But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts, that the wheel of \
fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel, and that those who were up yesterday \
are down to-day. I am sorry for my wife and children, for when they might \
fairly and reasonably expect to see their father return to them a governor or \
viceroy of some island or kingdom, they will see him come back a horse-boy. I \
have said all this, senor curate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your \
conscience your ill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not \
call you to account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way, \
and charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don \
Quixote leaves undone while he is shut up. \"Trim those lamps there!\" \
exclaimed the barber at this; \"so you are of the same fraternity as your \
master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see that you will have to keep him \
company in the cage, and be enchanted like him for having caught some of his \
humour and chivalry. It was an evil hour when you let yourself be got with \
child by his promises, and that island you long so much for found its way \
into your head.\" \"I am not with child by anyone,\" returned Sancho, \"nor \
am I a man to let myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. \
Though I am poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I \
long for an island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son of his \
own works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say governor of an \
island, especially as my master may win so many that he will not know whom to \
give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber; for shaving is not \
everything, and there is some difference between Peter and Peter. I say this \
because we all know one another, and it will not do to throw false dice with \
me; and as to the enchantment of my master, God knows the truth; leave it as \
it is; it only makes it worse to stir it.\" The barber did not care to answer \
Sancho lest by his plain speaking he should disclose what the curate and he \
himself were trying so hard to conceal; and under the same apprehension the \
curate had asked the canon to ride on a little in advance, so that he might \
tell him the mystery of this man in the cage, and other things that would \
amuse him. The canon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened \
with attention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of \
Don Quixote, given him by the curate, who described to him briefly the \
beginning and origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his \
adventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the plan they \
had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for \
his madness. The canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard \
Don Quixote's strange story, and when it was finished he said, \"To tell the \
truth, senor curate, I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry \
to be mischievous to the State; and though, led by idle and false taste, I \
have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed, I never could \
manage to read any one of them from beginning to end; for it seems to me they \
are all more or less the same thing; and one has nothing more in it than \
another; this no more than that. And in my opinion this sort of writing and \
composition is of the same species as the fables they call the Milesian, \
nonsensical tales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, \
exactly the opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the \
same time. And though it may be the chief object of such books to amuse, I do \
not know how they can succeed, when they are so full of such monstrous \
nonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels must come from the beauty and \
harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the things that the eye or the \
imagination brings before it; and nothing that has any ugliness or \
disproportion about it can give any pleasure. What beauty, then, or what \
proportion of the parts to the whole, or of the whole to the parts, can there \
be in a book or fable where a lad of sixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a \
tower and makes two halves of him as if he was an almond cake? And when they \
want to give us a picture of a battle, after having told us that there are a \
million of combatants on the side of the enemy, let the hero of the book be \
opposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we like it or not, \
that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his strong arm. \
And then, what shall we say of the facility with which a born queen or \
empress will give herself over into the arms of some unknown wandering \
knight? What mind, that is not wholly barbarous and uncultured, can find \
pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of knights sails away across \
the sea like a ship with a fair wind, and will be to-night in Lombardy and \
to-morrow morning in the land of Prester John of the Indies, or some other \
that Ptolemy never described nor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I \
am told that the authors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and \
therefore are not bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that \
fiction is all the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more \
pleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it. Plots in \
fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and be \
constructed in such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing over \
difficulties, keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise, interest, \
divert, and entertain, so that wonder and delight joined may keep pace one \
with the other; all which he will fail to effect who shuns verisimilitude and \
truth to nature, wherein lies the perfection of writing. I have never yet \
seen any book of chivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in all \
its numbers, so that the middle agrees with the beginning, and the end with \
the beginning and middle; on the contrary, they construct them with such a \
multitude of members that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera \
or monster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besides all this they \
are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements, licentious in \
their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix in their battles, \
silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels, and, in short, wanting in \
everything like intelligent art; for which reason they deserve to be banished \
from the Christian commonwealth as a worthless breed.\" The curate listened \
to him attentively and felt that he was a man of sound understanding, and \
that there was good reason in what he said; so he told him that, being of the \
same opinion himself, and bearing a grudge to books of chivalry, he had \
burned all Don Quixote's, which were many; and gave him an account of the \
scrutiny he had made of them, and of those he had condemned to the flames and \
those he had spared, with which the canon was not a little amused, adding \
that though he had said so much in condemnation of these books, still he \
found one good thing in them, and that was the opportunity they afforded to a \
gifted intellect for displaying itself; for they presented a wide and \
spacious field over which the pen might range freely, describing shipwrecks, \
tempests, combats, battles, portraying a valiant captain with all the \
qualifications requisite to make one, showing him sagacious in foreseeing the \
wiles of the enemy, eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his soldiers, \
ripe in counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold in biding his time as in pressing \
the attack; now picturing some sad tragic incident, now some joyful and \
unexpected event; here a beauteous lady, virtuous, wise, and modest; there a \
Christian knight, brave and gentle; here a lawless, barbarous braggart; there \
a courteous prince, gallant and gracious; setting forth the devotion and \
loyalty of vassals, the greatness and generosity of nobles. \"Or again,\" \
said he, \"the author may show himself to be an astronomer, or a skilled \
cosmographer, or musician, or one versed in affairs of state, and sometimes \
he will have a chance of coming forward as a magician if he likes. He can set \
forth the craftiness of Ulysses, the piety of AEneas, the valour of Achilles, \
the misfortunes of Hector, the treachery of Sinon, the friendship of \
Euryalus, the generosity of Alexander, the boldness of Caesar, the clemency \
and truth of Trajan, the fidelity of Zopyrus, the wisdom of Cato, and in \
short all the faculties that serve to make an illustrious man perfect, now \
uniting them in one individual, again distributing them among many; and if \
this be done with charm of style and ingenious invention, aiming at the truth \
as much as possible, he will assuredly weave a web of bright and varied \
threads that, when finished, will display such perfection and beauty that it \
will attain the worthiest object any writing can seek, which, as I said \
before, is to give instruction and pleasure combined; for the unrestricted \
range of these books enables the author to show his powers, epic, lyric, \
tragic, or comic, and all the moods the sweet and winning arts of poesy and \
oratory are capable of; for the epic may be written in prose just as well as \
in verse.\" CHAPTER XLVIII. IN WHICH THE CANON PURSUES THE SUBJECT OF THE \
BOOKS OF CHIVALRY, WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF HIS WIT \"It is as you say, \
senor canon,\" said the curate; \"and for that reason those who have hitherto \
written books of the sort deserve all the more censure for writing without \
paying any attention to good taste or the rules of art, by which they might \
guide themselves and become as famous in prose as the two princes of Greek \
and Latin poetry are in verse.\" \"I myself, at any rate,\" said the canon, \
\"was once tempted to write a book of chivalry in which all the points I have \
mentioned were to be observed; and if I must own the truth I have more than a \
hundred sheets written; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I \
showed them to persons who were fond of this kind of reading, to learned and \
intelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but the \
pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I obtained flattering \
approval; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with it, as well because it \
seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my profession, as because I \
perceived that the fools are more numerous than the wise; and, though it is \
better to be praised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish many, I \
have no mind to submit myself to the stupid judgment of the silly public, to \
whom the reading of such books falls for the most part. \"But what most of \
all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of finishing it was an \
argument I put to myself taken from the plays that are acted now-a-days, \
which was in this wise: if those that are now in vogue, as well those that \
are pure invention as those founded on history, are, all or most of them, \
downright nonsense and things that have neither head nor tail, and yet the \
public listens to them with delight, and regards and cries them up as \
perfection when they are so far from it; and if the authors who write them, \
and the players who act them, say that this is what they must be, for the \
public wants this and will have nothing else; and that those that go by rule \
and work out a plot according to the laws of art will only find some \
half-dozen intelligent people to understand them, while all the rest remain \
blind to the merit of their composition; and that for themselves it is better \
to get bread from the many than praise from the few; then my book will fare \
the same way, after I have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to observe the \
principles I have spoken of, and I shall be 'the tailor of the corner.' And \
though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors that they are mistaken \
in this notion they have adopted, and that they would attract more people, \
and get more credit, by producing plays in accordance with the rules of art, \
than by absurd ones, they are so thoroughly wedded to their own opinion that \
no argument or evidence can wean them from it. \"I remember saying one day to \
one of these obstinate fellows, 'Tell me, do you not recollect that a few \
years ago, there were three tragedies acted in Spain, written by a famous \
poet of these kingdoms, which were such that they filled all who heard them \
with admiration, delight, and interest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the \
masses as well as the higher orders, and brought in more money to the \
performers, these three alone, than thirty of the best that have been since \
produced?' \"'No doubt,' replied the actor in question, 'you mean the \
\"Isabella,\" the \"Phyllis,\" and the \"Alexandra.\"' \"'Those are the ones \
I mean,' said I; 'and see if they did not observe the principles of art, and \
if, by observing them, they failed to show their superiority and please all \
the world; so that the fault does not lie with the public that insists upon \
nonsense, but with those who don't know how to produce something else. \"The \
Ingratitude Revenged\" was not nonsense, nor was there any in \"The Numantia,\
\" nor any to be found in \"The Merchant Lover,\" nor yet in \"The Friendly \
Fair Foe,\" nor in some others that have been written by certain gifted \
poets, to their own fame and renown, and to the profit of those that brought \
them out;' some further remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left \
him rather dumbfoundered, but not so satisfied or convinced that I could \
disabuse him of his error.\" \"You have touched upon a subject, senor \
canon,\" observed the curate here, \"that has awakened an old enmity I have \
against the plays in vogue at the present day, quite as strong as that which \
I bear to the books of chivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, \
should be the mirror of human life, the model of manners, and the image of \
the truth, those which are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense, \
models of folly, and images of lewdness. For what greater nonsense can there \
be in connection with what we are now discussing than for an infant to appear \
in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first act, and in the second a \
grown-up bearded man? Or what greater absurdity can there be than putting \
before us an old man as a swashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey \
using fine language, a page giving sage advice, a king plying as a porter, a \
princess who is a kitchen-maid? And then what shall I say of their attention \
to the time in which the action they represent may or can take place, save \
that I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe, the second in \
Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it been in four acts, \
the fourth would have ended in America, and so it would have been laid in all \
four quarters of the globe? And if truth to life is the main thing the drama \
should keep in view, how is it possible for any average understanding to be \
satisfied when the action is supposed to pass in the time of King Pepin or \
Charlemagne, and the principal personage in it they represent to be the \
Emperor Heraclius who entered Jerusalem with the cross and won the Holy \
Sepulchre, like Godfrey of Bouillon, there being years innumerable between \
the one and the other? or, if the play is based on fiction and historical \
facts are introduced, or bits of what occurred to different people and at \
different times mixed up with it, all, not only without any semblance of \
probability, but with obvious errors that from every point of view are \
inexcusable? And the worst of it is, there are ignorant people who say that \
this is perfection, and that anything beyond this is affected refinement. And \
then if we turn to sacred dramas--what miracles they invent in them! What \
apocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing to one saint the miracles of \
another! And even in secular plays they venture to introduce miracles without \
any reason or object except that they think some such miracle, or \
transformation as they call it, will come in well to astonish stupid people \
and draw them to the play. All this tends to the prejudice of the truth and \
the corruption of history, nay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; \
for foreigners who scrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as \
barbarous and ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays \
we produce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief object \
well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to be performed \
in public is to entertain the people with some harmless amusement \
occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours which idleness is apt to \
engender; and that, as this may be attained by any sort of play, good or bad, \
there is no need to lay down laws, or bind those who write or act them to \
make them as they ought to be made, since, as I say, the object sought for \
may be secured by any sort. To this I would reply that the same end would be, \
beyond all comparison, better attained by means of good plays than by those \
that are not so; for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed \
play, the hearer will come away enlivened by the jests, instructed by the \
serious parts, full of admiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened by the \
arguments, warned by the tricks, all the wiser for the examples, inflamed \
against vice, and in love with virtue; for in all these ways a good play will \
stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish or dull; and of all \
impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed with all these qualities \
will not entertain, satisfy, and please much more than one wanting in them, \
like the greater number of those which are commonly acted now-a-days. Nor are \
the poets who write them to be blamed for this; for some there are among them \
who are perfectly well aware of their faults, and know what they ought to do; \
but as plays have become a salable commodity, they say, and with truth, that \
the actors will not buy them unless they are after this fashion; and so the \
poet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the actor who is to pay \
him for his work. And that this is the truth may be seen by the countless \
plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written, with so much \
brilliancy, so much grace and gaiety, such polished versification, such \
choice language, such profound reflections, and in a word, so rich in \
eloquence and elevation of style, that he has filled the world with his fame; \
and yet, in consequence of his desire to suit the taste of the actors, they \
have not all, as some of them have, come as near perfection as they ought. \
Others write plays with such heedlessness that, after they have been acted, \
the actors have to fly and abscond, afraid of being punished, as they often \
have been, for having acted something offensive to some king or other, or \
insulting to some noble family. All which evils, and many more that I say \
nothing of, would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible \
person at the capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only \
those produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be acted \
in Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local magistracy \
should allow any play to be acted. In that case actors would take care to \
send their plays to the capital, and could act them in safety, and those who \
write them would be more careful and take more pains with their work, \
standing in awe of having to submit it to the strict examination of one who \
understood the matter; and so good plays would be produced and the objects \
they aim at happily attained; as well the amusement of the people, as the \
credit of the wits of Spain, the interest and safety of the actors, and the \
saving of trouble in inflicting punishment on them. And if the same or some \
other person were authorised to examine the newly written books of chivalry, \
no doubt some would appear with all the perfections you have described, \
enriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure of eloquence, \
and driving the old books into obscurity before the light of the new ones \
that would come out for the harmless entertainment, not merely of the idle \
but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot be always bent, nor can weak \
human nature exist without some lawful amusement.\" The canon and the curate \
had proceeded thus far with their conversation, when the barber, coming \
forward, joined them, and said to the curate, \"This is the spot, senor \
licentiate, that I said was a good one for fresh and plentiful pasture for \
the oxen, while we take our noontide rest.\" \"And so it seems,\" returned \
the curate, and he told the canon what he proposed to do, on which he too \
made up his mind to halt with them, attracted by the aspect of the fair \
valley that lay before their eyes; and to enjoy it as well as the \
conversation of the curate, to whom he had begun to take a fancy, and also to \
learn more particulars about the doings of Don Quixote, he desired some of \
his servants to go on to the inn, which was not far distant, and fetch from \
it what eatables there might be for the whole party, as he meant to rest for \
the afternoon where he was; to which one of his servants replied that the \
sumpter mule, which by this time ought to have reached the inn, carried \
provisions enough to make it unnecessary to get anything from the inn except \
barley. \"In that case,\" said the canon, \"take all the beasts there, and \
bring the sumpter mule back.\" While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving \
that he could speak to his master without having the curate and the barber, \
of whom he had his suspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in \
which Don Quixote was placed, and said, \"Senor, to ease my conscience I want \
to tell you the state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that \
these two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our village and \
the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in \
this fashion, out of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doing \
famous deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you are not enchanted, \
but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I want to ask you one \
thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer, you will be able to \
lay your finger on the trick, and you will see that you are not enchanted but \
gone wrong in your wits.\" \"Ask what thou wilt, Sancho my son,\" returned \
Don Quixote, \"for I will satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest. As to \
what thou sayest, that these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the \
barber, our neighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may \
seem to be those same persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact, \
believe it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is that, if \
they look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who have enchanted \
me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy for enchanters to take \
any form they please, and they may have taken those of our friends in order \
to make thee think as thou dost, and lead thee into a labyrinth of fancies \
from which thou wilt find no escape though thou hadst the cord of Theseus; \
and they may also have done it to make me uncertain in my mind, and unable to \
conjecture whence this evil comes to me; for if on the one hand thou dost \
tell me that the barber and curate of our village are here in company with \
us, and on the other I find myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart \
that no power on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut \
me in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment is of \
a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the histories that deal \
with knights-errant that have been enchanted? So thou mayest set thy mind at \
rest as to the idea that they are what thou sayest, for they are as much so \
as I am a Turk. But touching thy desire to ask me something, say on, and I \
will answer thee, though thou shouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow \
morning.\" \"May Our Lady be good to me!\" said Sancho, lifting up his voice; \
\"and is it possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of \
brains that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and that \
malice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than enchantment? \
But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are not enchanted. Now \
tell me, so may God deliver you from this affliction, and so may you find \
yourself when you least expect it in the arms of my lady Dulcinea-\" \"Leave \
off conjuring me,\" said Don Quixote, \"and ask what thou wouldst know; I \
have already told thee I will answer with all possible precision.\" \"That is \
what I want,\" said Sancho; \"and what I would know, and have you tell me, \
without adding or leaving out anything, but telling the whole truth as one \
expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all who profess arms, as your \
worship professes them, under the title of knights-errant-\" \"I tell thee I \
will not lie in any particular,\" said Don Quixote; \"finish thy question; \
for in truth thou weariest me with all these asseverations, requirements, and \
precautions, Sancho.\" \"Well, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,\
\" said Sancho; \"and so, because it bears upon what we are talking about, I \
would ask, speaking with all reverence, whether since your worship has been \
shut up and, as you think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire \
or inclination to go anywhere, as the saying is?\" \"I do not understand \
'going anywhere,'\" said Don Quixote; \"explain thyself more clearly, Sancho, \
if thou wouldst have me give an answer to the point.\" \"Is it possible,\" \
said Sancho, \"that your worship does not understand 'going anywhere'? Why, \
the schoolboys know that from the time they were babes. Well then, you must \
know I mean have you had any desire to do what cannot be avoided?\" \"Ah! now \
I understand thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"yes, often, and even this \
minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right.\" CHAPTER XLIX. \
WHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS \
MASTER DON QUIXOTE \"Aha, I have caught you,\" said Sancho; \"this is what in \
my heart and soul I was longing to know. Come now, senor, can you deny what \
is commonly said around us, when a person is out of humour, 'I don't know \
what ails so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives \
a proper answer to any question; one would think he was enchanted'? From \
which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or sleep, or \
do any of the natural acts I am speaking of-that such persons are enchanted; \
but not those that have the desire your worship has, and drink when drink is \
given them, and eat when there is anything to eat, and answer every question \
that is asked them.\" \"What thou sayest is true, Sancho,\" replied Don \
Quixote; \"but I have already told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, \
and it may be that in the course of time they have been changed one for \
another, and that now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that \
I do, though they did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or draw \
inferences against the usage of the time. I know and feel that I am \
enchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh \
heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a \
faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage, \
defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need and \
distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and \
protection.\" \"Still for all that,\" replied Sancho, \"I say that, for your \
greater and fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try \
to get out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help, and \
even to take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount your good \
Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy and dejected; \
and then we might try our chance in looking for adventures again; and if we \
have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the cage; in which, on \
the faith of a good and loyal squire, I promise to shut myself up along with \
your worship, if so be you are so unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be \
able to carry out my plan.\" \"I am content to do as thou sayest, brother \
Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and when thou seest an opportunity for \
effecting my release I will obey thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, \
how mistaken thou art in thy conception of my misfortune.\" The knight-errant \
and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation till they reached the \
place where the curate, the canon, and the barber, who had already \
dismounted, were waiting for them. The carter at once unyoked the oxen and \
left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot, the freshness of \
which seemed to invite, not enchanted people like Don Quixote, but \
wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire, who begged the curate to allow his \
master to leave the cage for a little; for if they did not let him out, the \
prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his \
master required. The curate understood him, and said he would very gladly \
comply with his request, only that he feared his master, finding himself at \
liberty, would take to his old courses and make off where nobody could ever \
find him again. \"I will answer for his not running away,\" said Sancho. \
\"And I also,\" said the canon, \"especially if he gives me his word as a \
knight not to leave us without our consent.\" Don Quixote, who was listening \
to all this, said, \"I give it;-moreover one who is enchanted as I am cannot \
do as he likes with himself; for he who had enchanted him could prevent his \
moving from one place for three ages, and if he attempted to escape would \
bring him back flying.\"--And that being so, they might as well release him, \
particularly as it would be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let \
him out, he protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils \
unless they kept their distance. The canon took his hand, tied together as \
they both were, and on his word and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced \
beyond measure he was to find himself out of the cage. The first thing he did \
was to stretch himself all over, and then he went to where Rocinante was \
standing and giving him a couple of slaps on the haunches said, \"I still \
trust in God and in his blessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that \
we shall soon see ourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thy \
master on thy back, and I mounted upon thee, following the calling for which \
God sent me into the world.\" And so saying, accompanied by Sancho, he \
withdrew to a retired spot, from which he came back much relieved and more \
eager than ever to put his squire's scheme into execution. The canon gazed at \
him, wondering at the extraordinary nature of his madness, and that in all \
his remarks and replies he should show such excellent sense, and only lose \
his stirrups, as has been already said, when the subject of chivalry was \
broached. And so, moved by compassion, he said to him, as they all sat on the \
green grass awaiting the arrival of the provisions: \"Is it possible, gentle \
sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of books of chivalry can have had \
such an effect on your worship as to upset your reason so that you fancy \
yourself enchanted, and the like, all as far from the truth as falsehood \
itself is? How can there be any human understanding that can persuade itself \
there ever was all that infinity of Amadises in the world, or all that \
multitude of famous knights, all those emperors of Trebizond, all those \
Felixmartes of Hircania, all those palfreys, and damsels-errant, and \
serpents, and monsters, and giants, and marvellous adventures, and \
enchantments of every kind, and battles, and prodigious encounters, splendid \
costumes, love-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll dwarfs, love \
letters, billings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and, in a word, all that \
nonsense the books of chivalry contain? For myself, I can only say that when \
I read them, so long as I do not stop to think that they are all lies and \
frivolity, they give me a certain amount of pleasure; but when I come to \
consider what they are, I fling the very best of them at the wall, and would \
fling it into the fire if there were one at hand, as richly deserving such \
punishment as cheats and impostors out of the range of ordinary toleration, \
and as founders of new sects and modes of life, and teachers that lead the \
ignorant public to believe and accept as truth all the folly they contain. \
And such is their audacity, they even dare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen \
of birth and intelligence, as is shown plainly by the way they have served \
your worship, when they have brought you to such a pass that you have to be \
shut up in a cage and carried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a \
tiger from place to place to make money by showing it. Come, Senor Don \
Quixote, have some compassion for yourself, return to the bosom of common \
sense, and make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased \
to bestow upon you, employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other \
reading that may serve to benefit your conscience and add to your honour. And \
if, still led away by your natural bent, you desire to read books of \
achievements and of chivalry, read the Book of Judges in the Holy Scriptures, \
for there you will find grand reality, and deeds as true as they are heroic. \
Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a Caesar, Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an \
Alexander, Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a \
Gonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura a Diego Garcia de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez \
de Vargas, Toledo a Garcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose \
valiant deeds will entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them \
with delight and wonder. Here, Senor Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of \
your sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history, in \
love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners, brave \
without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the honour of God, \
your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I am informed, your \
worship derives your birth.\" Don Quixote listened with the greatest \
attention to the canon's words, and when he found he had finished, after \
regarding him for some time, he replied to him: \"It appears to me, gentle \
sir, that your worship's discourse is intended to persuade me that there \
never were any knights-errant in the world, and that all the books of \
chivalry are false, lying, mischievous and useless to the State, and that I \
have done wrong in reading them, and worse in believing them, and still worse \
in imitating them, when I undertook to follow the arduous calling of \
knight-errantry which they set forth; for you deny that there ever were \
Amadises of Gaul or of Greece, or any other of the knights of whom the books \
are full.\" \"It is all exactly as you state it,\" said the canon; to which \
Don Quixote returned, \"You also went on to say that books of this kind had \
done me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in a \
cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies, and \
read other truer books which would afford more pleasure and instruction.\" \
\"Just so,\" said the canon. \"Well then,\" returned Don Quixote, \"to my \
mind it is you who are the one that is out of his wits and enchanted, as you \
have ventured to utter such blasphemies against a thing so universally \
acknowledged and accepted as true that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves \
the same punishment which you say you inflict on the books that irritate you \
when you read them. For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all the \
other knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never existed, \
would be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not yield light, or \
ice cold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world can persuade another \
that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of Burgundy is not true, or \
that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible, which happened in the time of \
Charlemagne? For by all that is good it is as true as that it is daylight \
now; and if it be a lie, it must be a lie too that there was a Hector, or \
Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve Peers of France, or Arthur of England, who \
still lives changed into a raven, and is unceasingly looked for in his \
kingdom. One might just as well try to make out that the history of Guarino \
Mezquino, or of the quest of the Holy Grail, is false, or that the loves of \
Tristram and the Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as well as those of Guinevere \
and Lancelot, when there are persons who can almost remember having seen the \
Dame Quintanona, who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain. And so true is \
this, that I recollect a grandmother of mine on the father's side, whenever \
she saw any dame in a venerable hood, used to say to me, 'Grandson, that one \
is like Dame Quintanona,' from which I conclude that she must have known her, \
or at least had managed to see some portrait of her. Then who can deny that \
the story of Pierres and the fair Magalona is true, when even to this day may \
be seen in the king's armoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided \
the wooden horse he rode through the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the \
pole of a cart? And alongside of the pin is Babieca's saddle, and at \
Roncesvalles there is Roland's horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may \
infer that there were Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other \
knights like them, of the sort people commonly call adventurers. Or perhaps I \
shall be told, too, that there was no such knight-errant as the valiant \
Lusitanian Juan de Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in the city of Arras \
fought with the famous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres by name, and afterwards \
in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique de Remesten, coming out of both \
encounters covered with fame and honour; or adventures and challenges \
achieved and delivered, also in Burgundy, by the valiant Spaniards Pedro \
Barba and Gutierre Quixada (of whose family I come in the direct male line), \
when they vanquished the sons of the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too, \
that Don Fernando de Guevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, \
where he engaged in combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the \
Duke of Austria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Quinones, him of \
the 'Paso,' and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the Castilian \
knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well as many other \
achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign realms, which are so \
authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies them must be totally \
wanting in reason and good sense.\" The canon was amazed to hear the medley \
of truth and fiction Don Quixote uttered, and to see how well acquainted he \
was with everything relating or belonging to the achievements of his \
knight-errantry; so he said in reply: \"I cannot deny, Senor Don Quixote, \
that there is some truth in what you say, especially as regards the Spanish \
knights-errant; and I am willing to grant too that the Twelve Peers of France \
existed, but I am not disposed to believe that they did all the things that \
the Archbishop Turpin relates of them. For the truth of the matter is they \
were knights chosen by the kings of France, and called 'Peers' because they \
were all equal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were not they \
ought to have been), and it was a kind of religious order like those of \
Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is assumed that those \
who take it are valiant knights of distinction and good birth; and just as we \
say now a Knight of St. John, or of Alcantara, they used to say then a Knight \
of the Twelve Peers, because twelve equals were chosen for that military \
order. That there was a Cid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be \
no doubt; but that they did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very \
doubtful. In that other matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speak of, \
and say is near Babieca's saddle in the Armoury, I confess my sin; for I am \
either so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen the saddle, I \
have never been able to see the pin, in spite of it being as big as your \
worship says it is.\" \"For all that it is there, without any manner of \
doubt,\" said Don Quixote; \"and more by token they say it is inclosed in a \
sheath of cowhide to keep it from rusting.\" \"All that may be,\" replied the \
canon; \"but, by the orders I have received, I do not remember seeing it. \
However, granting it is there, that is no reason why I am bound to believe \
the stories of all those Amadises and of all that multitude of knights they \
tell us about, nor is it reasonable that a man like your worship, so worthy, \
and with so many good qualities, and endowed with such a good understanding, \
should allow himself to be persuaded that such wild crazy things as are \
written in those absurd books of chivalry are really true.\" CHAPTER L. OF \
THE SHREWD CONTROVERSY WHICH DON QUIXOTE AND THE CANON HELD, TOGETHER WITH \
OTHER INCIDENTS \"A good joke, that!\" returned Don Quixote. \"Books that \
have been printed with the king's licence, and with the approbation of those \
to whom they have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and \
extolled by great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and \
simple, in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank or condition they \
may be--that these should be lies! And above all when they carry such an \
appearance of truth with them; for they tell us the father, mother, country, \
kindred, age, place, and the achievements, step by step, and day by day, \
performed by such a knight or knights! Hush, sir; utter not such blasphemy; \
trust me I am advising you now to act as a sensible man should; only read \
them, and you will see the pleasure you will derive from them. For, come, \
tell me, can there be anything more delightful than to see, as it were, here \
now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes \
and serpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts \
swimming about in it, while from the middle of the lake there comes a \
plaintive voice saying: 'Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest this dread \
lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath these dusky \
waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself into the midst of \
its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be worthy to see the mighty \
wonders contained in the seven castles of the seven Fays that lie beneath \
this black expanse;' and then the knight, almost ere the awful voice has \
ceased, without stopping to consider, without pausing to reflect upon the \
danger to which he is exposing himself, without even relieving himself of the \
weight of his massive armour, commending himself to God and to his lady, \
plunges into the midst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, \
or knows what his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with \
which the Elysian fields are not to be compared. \"The sky seems more \
transparent there, and the sun shines with a strange brilliancy, and a \
delightful grove of green leafy trees presents itself to the eyes and charms \
the sight with its verdure, while the ear is soothed by the sweet untutored \
melody of the countless birds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the \
interlacing branches. Here he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid \
crystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like sifted gold \
and purest pearls. There he perceives a cunningly wrought fountain of \
many-coloured jasper and polished marble; here another of rustic fashion \
where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow mansions of \
the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled with fragments of glittering \
crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of varied aspect, where art, \
imitating nature, seems to have outdone it. \"Suddenly there is presented to \
his sight a strong castle or gorgeous palace with walls of massy gold, \
turrets of diamond and gates of jacinth; in short, so marvellous is its \
structure that though the materials of which it is built are nothing less \
than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the \
workmanship is still more rare. And after having seen all this, what can be \
more charming than to see how a bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate of \
the castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to set myself now to \
depict it as the histories describe it to us, I should never have done; and \
then how she who seems to be the first among them all takes the bold knight \
who plunged into the boiling lake by the hand, and without addressing a word \
to him leads him into the rich palace or castle, and strips him as naked as \
when his mother bore him, and bathes him in lukewarm water, and anoints him \
all over with sweet-smelling unguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the \
softest sendal, all scented and perfumed, while another damsel comes and \
throws over his shoulders a mantle which is said to be worth at the very \
least a city, and even more? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, \
after all this, they lead him to another chamber where he finds the tables \
set out in such style that he is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how \
they pour out water for his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented \
flowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the damsels wait on \
him all in profound silence; how they bring him such a variety of dainties so \
temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss which to select; to hear \
the music that resounds while he is at table, by whom or whence produced he \
knows not. And then when the repast is over and the tables removed, for the \
knight to recline in the chair, picking his teeth perhaps as usual, and a \
damsel, much lovelier than any of the others, to enter unexpectedly by the \
chamber door, and herself by his side, and begin to tell him what the castle \
is, and how she is held enchanted there, and other things that amaze the \
knight and astonish the readers who are perusing his history. \"But I will \
not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered from it that \
whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant one reads, it will fill \
the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder; and take my advice, sir, \
and, as I said before, read these books and you will see how they will banish \
any melancholy you may feel and raise your spirits should they be depressed. \
For myself I can say that since I have been a knight-errant I have become \
valiant, polite, generous, well-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, \
gentle, patient, and have learned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and \
enchantments; and though it be such a short time since I have seen myself \
shut up in a cage like a madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid \
me and fortune thwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may \
be able to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by \
my faith, senor, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of \
generosity to anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree; and \
gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as faith \
without works is dead. For this reason I should be glad were fortune soon to \
offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor, so as to show my heart \
in doing good to my friends, particularly to this poor Sancho Panza, my \
squire, who is the best fellow in the world; and I would gladly give him a \
county I have promised him this ever so long, only that I am afraid he has \
not the capacity to govern his realm.\" Sancho partly heard these last words \
of his master, and said to him, \"Strive hard you, Senor Don Quixote, to give \
me that county so often promised by you and so long looked for by me, for I \
promise you there will be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if \
there is, I have heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, \
paying so much a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government, \
while the lord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they pay him, \
without troubling himself about anything else. That's what I'll do, and not \
stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once of the whole business, \
and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things go their own way.\" \"That, \
brother Sancho,\" said the canon, \"only holds good as far as the enjoyment \
of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must attend to the \
administration of justice, and here capacity and sound judgment come in, and \
above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for if this be wanting \
in the beginning, the middle and the end will always go wrong; and God as \
commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as he frustrates the evil \
designs of the crafty.\" \"I don't understand those philosophies,\" returned \
Sancho Panza; \"all I know is I would I had the county as soon as I shall \
know how to govern it; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body \
as anyone, and I shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and \
being so I should do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, \
and pleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has \
nothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there is an \
end of it; so let the county come, and God he with you, and let us see one \
another, as one blind man said to the other.\" \"That is not bad philosophy \
thou art talking, Sancho,\" said the canon; \"but for all that there is a \
good deal to be said on this matter of counties.\" To which Don Quixote \
returned, \"I know not what more there is to be said; I only guide myself by \
the example set me by the great Amadis of Gaul, when he made his squire count \
of the Insula Firme; and so, without any scruples of conscience, I can make a \
count of Sancho Panza, for he is one of the best squires that ever \
knight-errant had.\" The canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if \
nonsense be capable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which \
he had described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression \
that the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly \
he marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtain \
the county his master had promised him. By this time the canon's servants, \
who had gone to the inn to fetch the sumpter mule, had returned, and making a \
carpet and the green grass of the meadow serve as a table, they seated \
themselves in the shade of some trees and made their repast there, that the \
carter might not be deprived of the advantage of the spot, as has been \
already said. As they were eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the \
sound of a bell that seemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes \
that were close by, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat, \
spotted all over black, white, and brown, spring out of the thicket with a \
goatherd after it, calling to it and uttering the usual cries to make it stop \
or turn back to the fold. The fugitive goat, scared and frightened, ran \
towards the company as if seeking their protection and then stood still, and \
the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and began to talk to it as if \
it were possessed of reason and understanding: \"Ah wanderer, wanderer, \
Spotty, Spotty; how have you gone limping all this time? What wolves have \
frightened you, my daughter? Won't you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? \
But what else can it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? A \
plague on your humours and the humours of those you take after! Come back, \
come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any rate you will \
be safe in the fold or with your companions; for if you who ought to keep and \
lead them, go wandering astray, what will become of them?\" The goatherd's \
talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon, who said to him, \"As \
you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in such a hurry to drive this \
goat back to the fold; for, being a female, as you say, she will follow her \
natural instinct in spite of all you can do to prevent it. Take this morsel \
and drink a sup, and that will soothe your irritation, and in the meantime \
the goat will rest herself,\" and so saying, he handed him the loins of a \
cold rabbit on a fork. The goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed \
himself, and then said, \"I should be sorry if your worships were to take me \
for a simpleton for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but \
the truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used. I am a clown, \
but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.\" \
\"That I can well believe,\" said the curate, \"for I know already by \
experience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds' harbour \
philosophers.\" \"At all events, senor,\" returned the goatherd, \"they \
shelter men of experience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp \
it, though I may seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if \
it will not tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a \
little, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman's word (and \
he pointed to the curate) as well as my own.\" To this Don Quixote replied, \
\"Seeing that this affair has a certain colour of chivalry about it, I for my \
part, brother, will hear you most gladly, and so will all these gentlemen, \
from the high intelligence they possess and their love of curious novelties \
that interest, charm, and entertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story \
will do. So begin, friend, for we are all prepared to listen.\" \"I draw my \
stakes,\" said Sancho, \"and will retreat with this pasty to the brook there, \
where I mean to victual myself for three days; for I have heard my lord, Don \
Quixote, say that a knight-errant's squire should eat until he can hold no \
more, whenever he has the chance, because it often happens them to get by \
accident into a wood so thick that they cannot find a way out of it for six \
days; and if the man is not well filled or his alforjas well stored, there he \
may stay, as very often he does, turned into a dried mummy.\" \"Thou art in \
the right of it, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"go where thou wilt and eat all \
thou canst, for I have had enough, and only want to give my mind its \
refreshment, as I shall by listening to this good fellow's story.\" \"It is \
what we shall all do,\" said the canon; and then begged the goatherd to begin \
the promised tale. The goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a \
couple of slaps on the back, saying, \"Lie down here beside me, Spotty, for \
we have time enough to return to our fold.\" The goat seemed to understand \
him, for as her master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside \
him and looked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what he \
was going to say, and then in these words he began his story. CHAPTER LI. \
WHICH DEALS WITH WHAT THE GOATHERD TOLD THOSE WHO WERE CARRYING OFF DON \
QUIXOTE Three leagues from this valley there is a village which, though \
small, is one of the richest in all this neighbourhood, and in it there lived \
a farmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to be so is \
the natural consequence of being rich, he was even more respected for his \
virtue than for the wealth he had acquired. But what made him still more \
fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of such exceeding \
beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, that everyone who knew \
her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary gifts with which heaven and \
nature had endowed her. As a child she was beautiful, she continued to grow \
in beauty, and at the age of sixteen she was most lovely. The fame of her \
beauty began to spread abroad through all the villages around--but why do I \
say the villages around, merely, when it spread to distant cities, and even \
made its way into the halls of royalty and reached the ears of people of \
every class, who came from all sides to see her as if to see something rare \
and curious, or some wonder-working image? Her father watched over her and \
she watched over herself; for there are no locks, or guards, or bolts that \
can protect a young girl better than her own modesty. The wealth of the \
father and the beauty of the daughter led many neighbours as well as \
strangers to seek her for a wife; but he, as one might well be who had the \
disposal of so rich a jewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to \
which of her countless suitors he should entrust her. I was one among the \
many who felt a desire so natural, and, as her father knew who I was, and I \
was of the same town, of pure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich in \
possessions, I had great hopes of success. There was another of the same \
place and qualifications who also sought her, and this made her father's \
choice hang in the balance, for he felt that on either of us his daughter \
would be well bestowed; so to escape from this state of perplexity he \
resolved to refer the matter to Leandra (for that is the name of the rich \
damsel who has reduced me to misery), reflecting that as we were both equal \
it would be best to leave it to his dear daughter to choose according to her \
inclination--a course that is worthy of imitation by all fathers who wish to \
settle their children in life. I do not mean that they ought to leave them to \
make a choice of what is contemptible and bad, but that they should place \
before them what is good and then allow them to make a good choice as they \
please. I do not know which Leandra chose; I only know her father put us both \
off with the tender age of his daughter and vague words that neither bound \
him nor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo and I myself Eugenio--that \
you may know the names of the personages that figure in this tragedy, the end \
of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to see it must be \
disastrous. About this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, \
the son of a poor peasant of the same town, the said Vicente having returned \
from service as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts. A captain who \
chanced to pass that way with his company had carried him off from our \
village when he was a boy of about twelve years, and now twelve years later \
the young man came back in a soldier's uniform, arrayed in a thousand \
colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine steel chains. To-day he would \
appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in another; but all flimsy and gaudy, of \
little substance and less worth. The peasant folk, who are naturally \
malicious, and when they have nothing to do can be malice itself, remarked \
all this, and took note of his finery and jewellery, piece by piece, and \
discovered that he had three suits of different colours, with garters and \
stockings to match; but he made so many arrangements and combinations out of \
them, that if they had not counted them, anyone would have sworn that he had \
made a display of more than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not \
look upon all this that I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled for or \
spun out, for they have a great deal to do with the story. He used to seat \
himself on a bench under the great poplar in our plaza, and there he would \
keep us all hanging open-mouthed on the stories he told us of his exploits. \
There was no country on the face of the globe he had not seen, nor battle he \
had not been engaged in; he had killed more Moors than there are in Morocco \
and Tunis, and fought more single combats, according to his own account, than \
Garcilaso, Diego Garcia de Paredes and a thousand others he named, and out of \
all he had come victorious without losing a drop of blood. On the other hand \
he showed marks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he said \
were gunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions. Lastly, with \
monstrous impudence he used to say \"you\" to his equals and even those who \
knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father and his deeds his \
pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the king himself. And to \
add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of a musician, and played the \
guitar with such a flourish that some said he made it speak; nor did his \
accomplishments end here, for he was something of a poet too, and on every \
trifle that happened in the town he made a ballad a league long. This \
soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca, this bravo, \
gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched by Leandra from a window \
of her house which looked out on the plaza. The glitter of his showy attire \
took her fancy, his ballads bewitched her (for he gave away twenty copies of \
every one he made), the tales of his exploits which he told about himself \
came to her ears; and in short, as the devil no doubt had arranged it, she \
fell in love with him before the presumption of making love to her had \
suggested itself to him; and as in love-affairs none are more easily brought \
to an issue than those which have the inclination of the lady for an ally, \
Leandra and Vicente came to an understanding without any difficulty; and \
before any of her numerous suitors had any suspicion of her design, she had \
already carried it into effect, having left the house of her dearly beloved \
father (for mother she had none), and disappeared from the village with the \
soldier, who came more triumphantly out of this enterprise than out of any of \
the large number he laid claim to. All the village and all who heard of it \
were amazed at the affair; I was aghast, Anselmo thunderstruck, her father \
full of grief, her relations indignant, the authorities all in a ferment, the \
officers of the Brotherhood in arms. They scoured the roads, they searched \
the woods and all quarters, and at the end of three days they found the \
flighty Leandra in a mountain cave, stript to her shift, and robbed of all \
the money and precious jewels she had carried away from home with her. They \
brought her back to her unhappy father, and questioned her as to her \
misfortune, and she confessed without pressure that Vicente de la Roca had \
deceived her, and under promise of marrying her had induced her to leave her \
father's house, as he meant to take her to the richest and most delightful \
city in the whole world, which was Naples; and that she, ill-advised and \
deluded, had believed him, and robbed her father, and handed over all to him \
the night she disappeared; and that he had carried her away to a rugged \
mountain and shut her up in the eave where they had found her. She said, \
moreover, that the soldier, without robbing her of her honour, had taken from \
her everything she had, and made off, leaving her in the cave, a thing that \
still further surprised everybody. It was not easy for us to credit the young \
man's continence, but she asserted it with such earnestness that it helped to \
console her distressed father, who thought nothing of what had been taken \
since the jewel that once lost can never be recovered had been left to his \
daughter. The same day that Leandra made her appearance her father removed \
her from our sight and took her away to shut her up in a convent in a town \
near this, in the hope that time may wear away some of the disgrace she has \
incurred. Leandra's youth furnished an excuse for her fault, at least with \
those to whom it was of no consequence whether she was good or bad; but those \
who knew her shrewdness and intelligence did not attribute her misdemeanour \
to ignorance but to wantonness and the natural disposition of women, which is \
for the most part flighty and ill-regulated. Leandra withdrawn from sight, \
Anselmo's eyes grew blind, or at any rate found nothing to look at that gave \
them any pleasure, and mine were in darkness without a ray of light to direct \
them to anything enjoyable while Leandra was away. Our melancholy grew \
greater, our patience grew less; we cursed the soldier's finery and railed at \
the carelessness of Leandra's father. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave \
the village and come to this valley; and, he feeding a great flock of sheep \
of his own, and I a large herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the \
trees, giving vent to our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra's \
praises, or upbraiding her, or else sighing alone, and to heaven pouring \
forth our complaints in solitude. Following our example, many more of \
Leandra's lovers have come to these rude mountains and adopted our mode of \
life, and they are so numerous that one would fancy the place had been turned \
into the pastoral Arcadia, so full is it of shepherds and sheep-folds; nor is \
there a spot in it where the name of the fair Leandra is not heard. Here one \
curses her and calls her capricious, fickle, and immodest, there another \
condemns her as frail and frivolous; this pardons and absolves her, that \
spurns and reviles her; one extols her beauty, another assails her character, \
and in short all abuse her, and all adore her, and to such a pitch has this \
general infatuation gone that there are some who complain of her scorn \
without ever having exchanged a word with her, and even some that bewail and \
mourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she never gave anyone cause, \
for, as I have already said, her misconduct was known before her passion. \
There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside, no shade beneath the trees \
that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his woes to the breezes; \
wherever there is an echo it repeats the name of Leandra; the mountains ring \
with \"Leandra,\" \"Leandra\" murmur the brooks, and Leandra keeps us all \
bewildered and bewitched, hoping without hope and fearing without knowing \
what we fear. Of all this silly set the one that shows the least and also the \
most sense is my rival Anselmo, for having so many other things to complain \
of, he only complains of separation, and to the accompaniment of a rebeck, \
which he plays admirably, he sings his complaints in verses that show his \
ingenuity. I follow another, easier, and to my mind wiser course, and that is \
to rail at the frivolity of women, at their inconstancy, their double \
dealing, their broken promises, their unkept pledges, and in short the want \
of reflection they show in fixing their affections and inclinations. This, \
sirs, was the reason of words and expressions I made use of to this goat when \
I came up just now; for as she is a female I have a contempt for her, though \
she is the best in all my fold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and \
if I have been tedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut \
is close by, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as a \
variety of toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate. \
CHAPTER LII. OF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER \
WITH THE RARE ADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEAT \
HE BROUGHT TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION The goatherd's tale gave great satisfaction \
to all the hearers, and the canon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked \
with particular attention the manner in which it had been told, which was as \
unlike the manner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished \
city wit; and he observed that the curate had been quite right in saying that \
the woods bred men of learning. They all offered their services to Eugenio \
but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who said \
to him, \"Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself in a position \
to attempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on your behalf, \
and would rescue Leandra from that convent (where no doubt she is kept \
against her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might try to prevent \
me, and would place her in your hands to deal with her according to your will \
and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no \
violence of any kind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust in God our \
Lord that the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but \
that the power of another better disposed may prove superior to it, and then \
I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by my \
profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and needy.\" The \
goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote's sorry appearance and looks, he \
was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him, \"Senor, who \
is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a strain?\" \"Who \
should it be,\" said the barber, \"but the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, \
the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector of damsels, the \
terror of giants, and the winner of battles?\" \"That,\" said the goatherd, \
\"sounds like what one reads in the books of the knights-errant, who did all \
that you say this man does; though it is my belief that either you are \
joking, or else this gentleman has empty lodgings in his head.\" \"You are a \
great scoundrel,\" said Don Quixote, \"and it is you who are empty and a \
fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore you;\" and \
passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that was near him and sent \
it full in the goatherd's face, with such force that he flattened his nose; \
but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, and found himself roughly \
handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to carpet, tablecloth, or \
diners, sprang upon Don Quixote, and seizing him by the throat with both \
hands would no doubt have throttled him, had not Sancho Panza that instant \
come to the rescue, and grasping him by the shoulders flung him down on the \
table, smashing plates, breaking glasses, and upsetting and scattering \
everything on it. Don Quixote, finding himself free, strove to get on top of \
the goatherd, who, with his face covered with blood, and soundly kicked by \
Sancho, was on all fours feeling about for one of the table-knives to take a \
bloody revenge with. The canon and the curate, however, prevented him, but \
the barber so contrived it that he got Don Quixote under him, and rained down \
upon him such a shower of fisticuffs that the poor knight's face streamed \
with blood as freely as his own. The canon and the curate were bursting with \
laughter, the officers were capering with delight, and both the one and the \
other hissed them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in a \
fight. Sancho alone was frantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp \
of one of the canon's servants, who kept him from going to his master's \
assistance. At last, while they were all, with the exception of the two \
bruisers who were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard \
a trumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction \
whence the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most excited by hearing \
it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his will he was under the \
goatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said to him, \
\"Brother devil (for it is impossible but that thou must be one since thou \
hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine), I ask thee to agree to \
a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on \
our ears seems to me to summon me to some new adventure.\" The goatherd, who \
was by this time tired of pummelling and being pummelled, released him at \
once, and Don Quixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter \
where the sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill \
several men clad in white like penitents. The fact was that the clouds had \
that year withheld their moisture from the earth, and in all the villages of \
the district they were organising processions, rogations, and penances, \
imploring God to open the hands of his mercy and send the rain; and to this \
end the people of a village that was hard by were going in procession to a \
holy hermitage there was on one side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw \
the strange garb of the penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen \
it before, took it into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that \
it fell to him alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the \
more confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they \
had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and discourteous \
thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this occurred to him he ran \
with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at large, and taking the bridle \
and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he had him bridled in an instant, and \
calling to Sancho for his sword he mounted Rocinante, braced his buckler on \
his arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who stood by, \"Now, noble \
company, ye shall see how important it is that there should be knights in the \
world professing the of knight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by the \
deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there, whether \
knights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,\" and so saying he brought \
his legs to bear on Rocinante--for he had no spurs--and at a full canter (for \
in all this veracious history we never read of Rocinante fairly galloping) \
set off to encounter the penitents, though the curate, the canon, and the \
barber ran to prevent him. But it was out of their power, nor did he even \
stop for the shouts of Sancho calling after him, \"Where are you going, Senor \
Don Quixote? What devils have possessed you to set you on against our \
Catholic faith? Plague take me! mind, that is a procession of penitents, and \
the lady they are carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the \
immaculate Virgin. Take care what you are doing, senor, for this time it may \
be safely said you don't know what you are about.\" Sancho laboured in vain, \
for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures \
and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and even had he \
heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered him. He came up \
with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was already anxious enough \
to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited voice he exclaimed, \"You \
who hide your faces, perhaps because you are not good subjects, pay attention \
and listen to what I am about to say to you.\" The first to halt were those \
who were carrying the image, and one of the four ecclesiastics who were \
chanting the Litany, struck by the strange figure of Don Quixote, the \
leanness of Rocinante, and the other ludicrous peculiarities he observed, \
said in reply to him, \"Brother, if you have anything to say to us say it \
quickly, for these brethren are whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor \
is it reasonable we should stop to hear anything, unless indeed it is short \
enough to be said in two words.\" \"I will say it in one,\" replied Don \
Quixote, \"and it is this; that at once, this very instant, ye release that \
fair lady whose tears and sad aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her \
off against her will, and that ye have committed some scandalous outrage \
against her; and I, who was born into the world to redress all such like \
wrongs, will not permit you to advance another step until you have restored \
to her the liberty she pines for and deserves.\" From these words all the \
hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and began to laugh heartily, and \
their laughter acted like gunpowder on Don Quixote's fury, for drawing his \
sword without another word he made a rush at the stand. One of those who \
supported it, leaving the burden to his comrades, advanced to meet him, \
flourishing a forked stick that he had for propping up the stand when \
resting, and with this he caught a mighty cut Don Quixote made at him that \
severed it in two; but with the portion that remained in his hand he dealt \
such a thwack on the shoulder of Don Quixote's sword arm (which the buckler \
could not protect against the clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to \
the ground in a sad plight. Sancho Panza, who was coming on close behind \
puffing and blowing, seeing him fall, cried out to his assailant not to \
strike him again, for he was poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed \
anyone all the days of his life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho's \
shouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, \
fancying he had killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle \
and took to his heels across the country like a deer. By this time all Don \
Quixote's companions had come up to where he lay; but the processionists \
seeing them come running, and with them the officers of the Brotherhood with \
their crossbows, apprehended mischief, and clustering round the image, raised \
their hoods, and grasped their scourges, as the priests did their tapers, and \
awaited the attack, resolved to defend themselves and even to take the \
offensive against their assailants if they could. Fortune, however, arranged \
the matter better than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself \
on his master's body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable \
lamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. The curate was \
known to another curate who walked in the procession, and their recognition \
of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both parties; the first then \
told the other in two words who Don Quixote was, and he and the whole troop \
of penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho \
Panza saying, with tears in his eyes, \"Oh flower of chivalry, that with one \
blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy well-spent life! Oh pride of thy \
race, honour and glory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want \
of thee will be full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their \
misdeeds! Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for only eight \
months of service thou hast given me the best island the sea girds or \
surrounds! Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble, encounterer of \
dangers, endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason, imitator of the good, \
scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, which is \
all that can be said!\" At the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to \
himself, and the first word he said was, \"He who lives separated from you, \
sweetest Dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend \
Sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to press the \
saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces.\" \"That I \
will do with all my heart, senor,\" said Sancho; \"and let us return to our \
village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there we will prepare \
for making another sally, which may turn out more profitable and creditable \
to us.\" \"Thou art right, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote; \"It will be wise \
to let the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.\" The \
canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely in doing \
as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza's simplicities, they placed \
Don Quixote in the cart as before. The procession once more formed itself in \
order and proceeded on its road; the goatherd took his leave of the party; \
the officers of the Brotherhood declined to go any farther, and the curate \
paid them what was due to them; the canon begged the curate to let him know \
how Don Quixote did, whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered \
from it, and then begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all \
separated and went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the \
barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded \
everything with as great resignation as his master. The carter yoked his oxen \
and made Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his usual \
deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six days \
they reached Don Quixote's village, and entered it about the middle of the \
day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the people were all in the plaza, \
through which Don Quixote's cart passed. They all flocked to see what was in \
the cart, and when they recognised their townsman they were filled with \
amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his \
niece that their master and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and \
stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries \
the two good ladies raised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh \
maledictions on those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when \
they saw Don Quixote coming in at the gate. At the news of Don Quixote's \
arrival Sancho Panza's wife came running, for she by this time knew that her \
husband had gone away with him as his squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first \
thing she asked him was if the ass was well. Sancho replied that he was, \
better than his master was. \"Thanks be to God,\" said she, \"for being so \
good to me; but now tell me, my friend, what have you made by your squirings? \
What gown have you brought me back? What shoes for your children?\" \"I bring \
nothing of that sort, wife,\" said Sancho; \"though I bring other things of \
more consequence and value.\" \"I am very glad of that,\" returned his wife; \
\"show me these things of more value and consequence, my friend; for I want \
to see them to cheer my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages \
that you have been away.\" \"I will show them to you at home, wife,\" said \
Sancho; \"be content for the present; for if it please God that we should \
again go on our travels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a \
count, or governor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but \
the best that is to be had.\" \"Heaven grant it, husband,\" said she, \"for \
indeed we have need of it. But tell me, what's this about islands, for I \
don't understand it?\" \"Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,\" returned \
Sancho; \"all in good time thou shalt see, wife--nay, thou wilt be surprised \
to hear thyself called 'your ladyship' by all thy vassals.\" \"What are you \
talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and vassals?\" returned \
Teresa Panza--for so Sancho's wife was called, though they were not \
relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to take their husbands' \
surnames. \"Don't be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,\" said Sancho; \
\"it is enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I may \
tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world more \
delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a knight-errant, \
and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one finds do not end as \
pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred, ninety-nine will turn out \
cross and contrary. I know it by experience, for out of some I came \
blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still, for all that, it is a fine \
thing to be on the look-out for what may happen, crossing mountains, \
searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting castles, putting up at inns, all at \
free quarters, and devil take the maravedi to pay.\" While this conversation \
passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don Quixote's housekeeper and niece \
took him in and undressed him and laid him in his old bed. He eyed them \
askance, and could not make out where he was. The curate charged his niece to \
be very careful to make her uncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him \
lest he should make his escape from them again, telling her what they had \
been obliged to do to bring him home. On this the pair once more lifted up \
their voices and renewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and \
implored heaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the \
midst of the bottomless pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread \
lest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he found \
himself somewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out. But the author of \
this history, though he has devoted research and industry to the discovery of \
the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his third sally, has been unable to \
obtain any information respecting them, at any rate derived from authentic \
documents; tradition has merely preserved in the memory of La Mancha the fact \
that Don Quixote, the third time he sallied forth from his home, betook \
himself to Saragossa, where he was present at some famous jousts which came \
off in that city, and that he had adventures there worthy of his valour and \
high intelligence. Of his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor \
would he have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not produced \
an old physician for him who had in his possession a leaden box, which, \
according to his account, had been discovered among the crumbling foundations \
of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box were found \
certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in Castilian verse, \
containing many of his achievements, and setting forth the beauty of \
Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho Panza, and the burial \
of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his \
life and character; but all that could be read and deciphered were those \
which the trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here \
presents. And the said author asks of those that shall read it nothing in \
return for the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and searching the \
Manchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that they give him the \
same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry that pervade \
the world and are so popular; for with this he will consider himself amply \
paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged to seek out and produce \
other histories, if not as truthful, at least equal in invention and not less \
entertaining. The first words written on the parchment found in the leaden \
box were these: THE ACADEMICIANS OF ARGAMASILLA, A VILLAGE OF LA MANCHA, ON \
THE LIFE AND DEATH OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA, HOC SCRIPSERUNT MONICONGO, \
ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA, ON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE EPITAPH The \
scatterbrain that gave La Mancha more Rich spoils than Jason's; who a point \
so keen Had to his wit, and happier far had been If his wit's weathercock a \
blunter bore; The arm renowned far as Gaeta's shore, Cathay, and all the \
lands that lie between; The muse discreet and terrible in mien As ever wrote \
on brass in days of yore; He who surpassed the Amadises all, And who as \
naught the Galaors accounted, Supported by his love and gallantry: Who made \
the Belianises sing small, And sought renown on Rocinante mounted; Here, \
underneath this cold stone, doth he lie. PANIAGUADO, ACADEMICIAN OF \
ARGAMASILLA, IN LAUDEM DULCINEAE DEL TOBOSO SONNET She, whose full features \
may be here descried, High-bosomed, with a bearing of disdain, Is Dulcinea, \
she for whom in vain The great Don Quixote of La Mancha sighed. For her, \
Toboso's queen, from side to side He traversed the grim sierra, the champaign \
Of Aranjuez, and Montiel's famous plain: On Rocinante oft a weary ride. \
Malignant planets, cruel destiny, Pursued them both, the fair Manchegan dame, \
And the unconquered star of chivalry. Nor youth nor beauty saved her from the \
claim Of death; he paid love's bitter penalty, And left the marble to \
preserve his name. CAPRICHOSO, A MOST ACUTE ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA, IN \
PRAISE OF ROCINANTE, STEED OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA SONNET On that proud \
throne of diamantine sheen, Which the blood-reeking feet of Mars degrade, The \
mad Manchegan's banner now hath been By him in all its bravery displayed. \
There hath he hung his arms and trenchant blade Wherewith, achieving deeds \
till now unseen, He slays, lays low, cleaves, hews; but art hath made A novel \
style for our new paladin. If Amadis be the proud boast of Gaul, If by his \
progeny the fame of Greece Through all the regions of the earth be spread, \
Great Quixote crowned in grim Bellona's hall To-day exalts La Mancha over \
these, And above Greece or Gaul she holds her head. Nor ends his glory here, \
for his good steed Doth Brillador and Bayard far exceed; As mettled steeds \
compared with Rocinante, The reputation they have won is scanty. BURLADOR, \
ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA, ON SANCHO PANZA SONNET The worthy Sancho Panza \
here you see; A great soul once was in that body small, Nor was there squire \
upon this earthly ball So plain and simple, or of guile so free. Within an \
ace of being Count was he, And would have been but for the spite and gall Of \
this vile age, mean and illiberal, That cannot even let a donkey be. For \
mounted on an ass (excuse the word), By Rocinante's side this gentle squire \
Was wont his wandering master to attend. Delusive hopes that lure the common \
herd With promises of ease, the heart's desire, In shadows, dreams, and smoke \
ye always end. CACHIDIABLO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA, ON THE TOMB OF DON \
QUIXOTE EPITAPH The knight lies here below, Ill-errant and bruised sore, Whom \
Rocinante bore In his wanderings to and fro. By the side of the knight is \
laid Stolid man Sancho too, Than whom a squire more true Was not in the \
esquire trade. TIQUITOC, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA, ON THE TOMB OF DULCINEA \
DEL TOBOSO EPITAPH Here Dulcinea lies. Plump was she and robust: Now she is \
ashes and dust: The end of all flesh that dies. A lady of high degree, With \
the port of a lofty dame, And the great Don Quixote's flame, And the pride of \
her village was she. These were all the verses that could be deciphered; the \
rest, the writing being worm-eaten, were handed over to one of the \
Academicians to make out their meaning conjecturally. We have been informed \
that at the cost of many sleepless nights and much toil he has succeeded, and \
that he means to publish them in hopes of Don Quixote's third sally. \"Forse \
altro cantera con miglior plectro.\"  BOOK I PROEM Mother of Rome, delight of \
Gods and men, Dear Venus that beneath the gliding stars Makest to teem the \
many-voyaged main And fruitful lands- for all of living things Through thee \
alone are evermore conceived, Through thee are risen to visit the great sun- \
Before thee, Goddess, and thy coming on, Flee stormy wind and massy cloud \
away, For thee the daedal Earth bears scented flowers, For thee waters of the \
unvexed deep Smile, and the hollows of the serene sky Glow with diffused \
radiance for thee! For soon as comes the springtime face of day, And \
procreant gales blow from the West unbarred, First fowls of air, smit to the \
heart by thee, Foretoken thy approach, O thou Divine, And leap the wild herds \
round the happy fields Or swim the bounding torrents. Thus amain, Seized with \
the spell, all creatures follow thee Whithersoever thou walkest forth to \
lead, And thence through seas and mountains and swift streams, Through leafy \
homes of birds and greening plains, Kindling the lure of love in every \
breast, Thou bringest the eternal generations forth, Kind after kind. And \
since 'tis thou alone Guidest the Cosmos, and without thee naught Is risen to \
reach the shining shores of light, Nor aught of joyful or of lovely born, \
Thee do I crave co-partner in that verse Which I presume on Nature to compose \
For Memmius mine, whom thou hast willed to be Peerless in every grace at \
every hour- Wherefore indeed, Divine one, give my words Immortal charm. Lull \
to a timely rest O'er sea and land the savage works of war, For thou alone \
hast power with public peace To aid mortality; since he who rules The savage \
works of battle, puissant Mars, How often to thy bosom flings his strength \
O'ermastered by the eternal wound of love- And there, with eyes and full \
throat backward thrown, Gazing, my Goddess, open-mouthed at thee, Pastures on \
love his greedy sight, his breath Hanging upon thy lips. Him thus reclined \
Fill with thy holy body, round, above! Pour from those lips soft syllables to \
win Peace for the Romans, glorious Lady, peace! For in a season troublous to \
the state Neither may I attend this task of mine With thought untroubled, nor \
mid such events The illustrious scion of the Memmian house Neglect the civic \
cause. Whilst human kind Throughout the lands lay miserably crushed Before \
all eyes beneath Religion- who Would show her head along the region skies, \
Glowering on mortals with her hideous face- A Greek it was who first opposing \
dared Raise mortal eyes that terror to withstand, Whom nor the fame of Gods \
nor lightning's stroke Nor threatening thunder of the ominous sky Abashed; \
but rather chafed to angry zest His dauntless heart to be the first to rend \
The crossbars at the gates of Nature old. And thus his will and hardy wisdom \
won; And forward thus he fared afar, beyond The flaming ramparts of the \
world, until He wandered the unmeasurable All. Whence he to us, a conqueror, \
reports What things can rise to being, what cannot, And by what law to each \
its scope prescribed, Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time. \
Wherefore Religion now is under foot, And us his victory now exalts to \
heaven. I know how hard it is in Latian verse To tell the dark discoveries of \
the Greeks, Chiefly because our pauper-speech must find Strange terms to fit \
the strangeness of the thing; Yet worth of thine and the expected joy Of thy \
sweet friendship do persuade me on To bear all toil and wake the clear nights \
through, Seeking with what of words and what of song I may at last most \
gloriously uncloud For thee the light beyond, wherewith to view The core of \
being at the centre hid. And for the rest, summon to judgments true, Unbusied \
ears and singleness of mind Withdrawn from cares; lest these my gifts, \
arranged For thee with eager service, thou disdain Before thou comprehendest: \
since for thee I prove the supreme law of Gods and sky, And the primordial \
germs of things unfold, Whence Nature all creates, and multiplies And fosters \
all, and whither she resolves Each in the end when each is overthrown. This \
ultimate stock we have devised to name Procreant atoms, matter, seeds of \
things, Or primal bodies, as primal to the world. I fear perhaps thou deemest \
that we fare An impious road to realms of thought profane; But 'tis that same \
religion oftener far Hath bred the foul impieties of men: As once at Aulis, \
the elected chiefs, Foremost of heroes, Danaan counsellors, Defiled Diana's \
altar, virgin queen, With Agamemnon's daughter, foully slain. She felt the \
chaplet round her maiden locks And fillets, fluttering down on either cheek, \
And at the altar marked her grieving sire, The priests beside him who \
concealed the knife, And all the folk in tears at sight of her. With a dumb \
terror and a sinking knee She dropped; nor might avail her now that first \
'Twas she who gave the king a father's name. They raised her up, they bore \
the trembling girl On to the altar- hither led not now With solemn rites and \
hymeneal choir, But sinless woman, sinfully foredone, A parent felled her on \
her bridal day, Making his child a sacrificial beast To give the ships \
auspicious winds for Troy: Such are the crimes to which Religion leads. And \
there shall come the time when even thou, Forced by the soothsayer's \
terror-tales, shalt seek To break from us. Ah, many a dream even now Can they \
concoct to rout thy plans of life, And trouble all thy fortunes with base \
fears. I own with reason: for, if men but knew Some fixed end to ills, they \
would be strong By some device unconquered to withstand Religions and the \
menacings of seers. But now nor skill nor instrument is theirs, Since men \
must dread eternal pains in death. For what the soul may be they do not know, \
Whether 'tis born, or enter in at birth, And whether, snatched by death, it \
die with us, Or visit the shadows and the vasty caves Of Orcus, or by some \
divine decree Enter the brute herds, as our Ennius sang, Who first from \
lovely Helicon brought down A laurel wreath of bright perennial leaves, \
Renowned forever among the Italian clans. Yet Ennius too in everlasting verse \
Proclaims those vaults of Acheron to be, Though thence, he said, nor souls \
nor bodies fare, But only phantom figures, strangely wan, And tells how once \
from out those regions rose Old Homer's ghost to him and shed salt tears And \
with his words unfolded Nature's source. Then be it ours with steady mind to \
clasp The purport of the skies- the law behind The wandering courses of the \
sun and moon; To scan the powers that speed all life below; But most to see \
with reasonable eyes Of what the mind, of what the soul is made, And what it \
is so terrible that breaks On us asleep, or waking in disease, Until we seem \
to mark and hear at hand Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago. \
SUBSTANCE IS ETERNAL This terror, then, this darkness of the mind, Not \
sunrise with its flaring spokes of light, Nor glittering arrows of morning \
can disperse, But only Nature's aspect and her law, Which, teaching us, hath \
this exordium: Nothing from nothing ever yet was born. Fear holds dominion \
over mortality Only because, seeing in land and sky So much the cause whereof \
no wise they know, Men think Divinities are working there. Meantime, when \
once we know from nothing still Nothing can be create, we shall divine More \
clearly what we seek: those elements From which alone all things created are, \
And how accomplished by no tool of Gods. Suppose all sprang from all things: \
any kind Might take its origin from any thing, No fixed seed required. Men \
from the sea Might rise, and from the land the scaly breed, And, fowl full \
fledged come bursting from the sky; The horned cattle, the herds and all the \
wild Would haunt with varying offspring tilth and waste; Nor would the same \
fruits keep their olden trees, But each might grow from any stock or limb By \
chance and change. Indeed, and were there not For each its procreant atoms, \
could things have Each its unalterable mother old? But, since produced from \
fixed seeds are all, Each birth goes forth upon the shores of light From its \
own stuff, from its own primal bodies. And all from all cannot become, \
because In each resides a secret power its own. Again, why see we lavished \
o'er the lands At spring the rose, at summer heat the corn, The vines that \
mellow when the autumn lures, If not because the fixed seeds of things At \
their own season must together stream, And new creations only be revealed \
When the due times arrive and pregnant earth Safely may give unto the shores \
of light Her tender progenies? But if from naught Were their becoming, they \
would spring abroad Suddenly, unforeseen, in alien months, With no primordial \
germs, to be preserved From procreant unions at an adverse hour. Nor on the \
mingling of the living seeds Would space be needed for the growth of things \
Were life an increment of nothing: then The tiny babe forthwith would walk a \
man, And from the turf would leap a branching tree- Wonders unheard of; for, \
by Nature, each Slowly increases from its lawful seed, And through that \
increase shall conserve its kind. Whence take the proof that things enlarge \
and feed From out their proper matter. Thus it comes That earth, without her \
seasons of fixed rains, Could bear no produce such as makes us glad, And \
whatsoever lives, if shut from food, Prolongs its kind and guards its life no \
more. Thus easier 'tis to hold that many things Have primal bodies in common \
(as we see The single letters common to many words) Than aught exists without \
its origins. Moreover, why should Nature not prepare Men of a bulk to ford \
the seas afoot, Or rend the mighty mountains with their hands, Or conquer \
Time with length of days, if not Because for all begotten things abides The \
changeless stuff, and what from that may spring Is fixed forevermore? Lastly \
we see How far the tilled surpass the fields untilled And to the labour of \
our hands return Their more abounding crops; there are indeed Within the \
earth primordial germs of things, Which, as the ploughshare turns the \
fruitful clods And kneads the mould, we quicken into birth. Else would ye \
mark, without all toil of ours, Spontaneous generations, fairer forms. \
Confess then, naught from nothing can become, Since all must have their \
seeds, wherefrom to grow, Wherefrom to reach the gentle fields of air. Hence \
too it comes that Nature all dissolves Into their primal bodies again, and \
naught Perishes ever to annihilation. For, were aught mortal in its every \
part, Before our eyes it might be snatched away Unto destruction; since no \
force were needed To sunder its members and undo its bands. Whereas, of \
truth, because all things exist, With seed imperishable, Nature allows \
Destruction nor collapse of aught, until Some outward force may shatter by a \
blow, Or inward craft, entering its hollow cells, Dissolve it down. And more \
than this, if Time, That wastes with eld the works along the world, Destroy \
entire, consuming matter all, Whence then may Venus back to light of life \
Restore the generations kind by kind? Or how, when thus restored, may daedal \
Earth Foster and plenish with her ancient food, Which, kind by kind, she \
offers unto each? Whence may the water-springs, beneath the sea, Or inland \
rivers, far and wide away, Keep the unfathomable ocean full? And out of what \
does Ether feed the stars? For lapsed years and infinite age must else Have \
eat all shapes of mortal stock away: But be it the Long Ago contained those \
germs, By which this sum of things recruited lives, Those same infallibly can \
never die, Nor nothing to nothing evermore return. And, too, the selfsame \
power might end alike All things, were they not still together held By matter \
eternal, shackled through its parts, Now more, now less. A touch might be \
enough To cause destruction. For the slightest force Would loose the weft of \
things wherein no part Were of imperishable stock. But now Because the \
fastenings of primordial parts Are put together diversely and stuff Is \
everlasting, things abide the same Unhurt and sure, until some power comes on \
Strong to destroy the warp and woof of each: Nothing returns to naught; but \
all return At their collapse to primal forms of stuff. Lo, the rains perish \
which Ether-father throws Down to the bosom of Earth-mother; but then \
Upsprings the shining grain, and boughs are green Amid the trees, and trees \
themselves wax big And lade themselves with fruits; and hence in turn The \
race of man and all the wild are fed; Hence joyful cities thrive with boys \
and girls; And leafy woodlands echo with new birds; Hence cattle, fat and \
drowsy, lay their bulk Along the joyous pastures whilst the drops Of white \
ooze trickle from distended bags; Hence the young scamper on their weakling \
joints Along the tender herbs, fresh hearts afrisk With warm new milk. Thus \
naught of what so seems Perishes utterly, since Nature ever Upbuilds one \
thing from other, suffering naught To come to birth but through some other's \
death. And now, since I have taught that things cannot Be born from nothing, \
nor the same, when born, To nothing be recalled, doubt not my words, Because \
our eyes no primal germs perceive; For mark those bodies which, though known \
to be In this our world, are yet invisible: The winds infuriate lash our face \
and frame, Unseen, and swamp huge ships and rend the clouds, Or, eddying \
wildly down, bestrew the plains With mighty trees, or scour the mountain tops \
With forest-crackling blasts. Thus on they rave With uproar shrill and \
ominous moan. The winds, 'Tis clear, are sightless bodies sweeping through \
The sea, the lands, the clouds along the sky, Vexing and whirling and seizing \
all amain; And forth they flow and pile destruction round, Even as the \
water's soft and supple bulk Becoming a river of abounding floods, Which a \
wide downpour from the lofty hills Swells with big showers, dashes headlong \
down Fragments of woodland and whole branching trees; Nor can the solid \
bridges bide the shock As on the waters whelm: the turbulent stream, Strong \
with a hundred rains, beats round the piers, Crashes with havoc, and rolls \
beneath its waves Down-toppled masonry and ponderous stone, Hurling away \
whatever would oppose. Even so must move the blasts of all the winds, Which, \
when they spread, like to a mighty flood, Hither or thither, drive things on \
before And hurl to ground with still renewed assault, Or sometimes in their \
circling vortex seize And bear in cones of whirlwind down the world: The \
winds are sightless bodies and naught else- Since both in works and ways they \
rival well The mighty rivers, the visible in form. Then too we know the \
varied smells of things Yet never to our nostrils see them come; With eyes we \
view not burning heats, nor cold, Nor are we wont men's voices to behold. Yet \
these must be corporeal at the base, Since thus they smite the senses: naught \
there is Save body, having property of touch. And raiment, hung by surf-beat \
shore, grows moist, The same, spread out before the sun, will dry; Yet no one \
saw how sank the moisture in, Nor how by heat off-driven. Thus we know, That \
moisture is dispersed about in bits Too small for eyes to see. Another case: \
A ring upon the finger thins away Along the under side, with years and suns; \
The drippings from the eaves will scoop the stone; The hooked ploughshare, \
though of iron, wastes Amid the fields insidiously. We view The rock-paved \
highways worn by many feet; And at the gates the brazen statues show Their \
right hands leaner from the frequent touch Of wayfarers innumerable who \
greet. We see how wearing-down hath minished these, But just what motes \
depart at any time, The envious nature of vision bars our sight. Lastly \
whatever days and nature add Little by little, constraining things to grow In \
due proportion, no gaze however keen Of these our eyes hath watched and \
known. No more Can we observe what's lost at any time, When things wax old \
with eld and foul decay, Or when salt seas eat under beetling crags. Thus \
Nature ever by unseen bodies works. THE VOID But yet creation's neither \
crammed nor blocked About by body: there's in things a void- Which to have \
known will serve thee many a turn, Nor will not leave thee wandering in \
doubt, Forever searching in the sum of all, And losing faith in these \
pronouncements mine. There's place intangible, a void and room. For were it \
not, things could in nowise move; Since body's property to block and check \
Would work on all and at an times the same. Thus naught could evermore push \
forth and go, Since naught elsewhere would yield a starting place. But now \
through oceans, lands, and heights of heaven, By divers causes and in divers \
modes, Before our eyes we mark how much may move, Which, finding not a void, \
would fail deprived Of stir and motion; nay, would then have been Nowise \
begot at all, since matter, then, Had staid at rest, its parts together \
crammed. Then too, however solid objects seem, They yet are formed of matter \
mixed with void: In rocks and caves the watery moisture seeps, And beady \
drops stand out like plenteous tears; And food finds way through every frame \
that lives; The trees increase and yield the season's fruit Because their \
food throughout the whole is poured, Even from the deepest roots, through \
trunks and boughs; And voices pass the solid walls and fly Reverberant \
through shut doorways of a house; And stiffening frost seeps inward to our \
bones. Which but for voids for bodies to go through 'Tis clear could happen \
in nowise at all. Again, why see we among objects some Of heavier weight, but \
of no bulkier size? Indeed, if in a ball of wool there be As much of body as \
in lump of lead, The two should weigh alike, since body tends To load things \
downward, while the void abides, By contrary nature, the imponderable. \
Therefore, an object just as large but lighter Declares infallibly its more \
of void; Even as the heavier more of matter shows, And how much less of \
vacant room inside. That which we're seeking with sagacious quest Exists, \
infallibly, commixed with things- The void, the invisible inane. Right here I \
am compelled a question to expound, Forestalling something certain folk \
suppose, Lest it avail to lead thee off from truth: Waters (they say) before \
the shining breed Of the swift scaly creatures somehow give, And straightway \
open sudden liquid paths, Because the fishes leave behind them room To which \
at once the yielding billows stream. Thus things among themselves can yet be \
moved, And change their place, however full the Sum- Received opinion, wholly \
false forsooth. For where can scaly creatures forward dart, Save where the \
waters give them room? Again, Where can the billows yield a way, so long As \
ever the fish are powerless to go? Thus either all bodies of motion are \
deprived, Or things contain admixture of a void Where each thing gets its \
start in moving on. Lastly, where after impact two broad bodies Suddenly \
spring apart, the air must crowd The whole new void between those bodies \
formed; But air, however it stream with hastening gusts, Can yet not fill the \
gap at once- for first It makes for one place, ere diffused through all. And \
then, if haply any think this comes, When bodies spring apart, because the \
air Somehow condenses, wander they from truth: For then a void is formed, \
where none before; And, too, a void is filled which was before. Nor can air \
be condensed in such a wise; Nor, granting it could, without a void, I hold, \
It still could not contract upon itself And draw its parts together into one. \
Wherefore, despite demur and counter-speech, Confess thou must there is a \
void in things. And still I might by many an argument Here scrape together \
credence for my words. But for the keen eye these mere footprints serve, \
Whereby thou mayest know the rest thyself. As dogs full oft with noses on the \
ground, Find out the silent lairs, though hid in brush, Of beasts, the \
mountain-rangers, when but once They scent the certain footsteps of the way, \
Thus thou thyself in themes like these alone Can hunt from thought to \
thought, and keenly wind Along even onward to the secret places And drag out \
truth. But, if thou loiter loth Or veer, however little, from the point, This \
I can promise, Memmius, for a fact: Such copious drafts my singing tongue \
shall pour From the large well-springs of my plenished breast That much I \
dread slow age will steal and coil Along our members, and unloose the gates \
Of life within us, ere for thee my verse Hath put within thine ears the \
stores of proofs At hand for one soever question broached. NOTHING EXISTS per \
se EXCEPT ATOMS AND THE VOID But, now again to weave the tale begun, All \
nature, then, as self-sustained, consists Of twain of things: of bodies and \
of void In which they're set, and where they're moved around. For common \
instinct of our race declares That body of itself exists: unless This primal \
faith, deep-founded, fail us not, Naught will there be whereunto to appeal On \
things occult when seeking aught to prove By reasonings of mind. Again, \
without That place and room, which we do call the inane, Nowhere could bodies \
then be set, nor go Hither or thither at all- as shown before. Besides, \
there's naught of which thou canst declare It lives disjoined from body, shut \
from void- A kind of third in nature. For whatever Exists must be a somewhat; \
and the same, If tangible, however fight and slight, Will yet increase the \
count of body's sum, With its own augmentation big or small; But, if \
intangible and powerless ever To keep a thing from passing through itself On \
any side, 'twill be naught else but that Which we do call the empty, the \
inane. Again, whate'er exists, as of itself, Must either act or suffer action \
on it, Or else be that wherein things move and be: Naught, saving body, acts, \
is acted on; Naught but the inane can furnish room. And thus, Beside the \
inane and bodies, is no third Nature amid the number of all things- Remainder \
none to fall at any time Under our senses, nor be seized and seen By any man \
through reasonings of mind. Name o'er creation with what names thou wilt, \
Thou'lt find but properties of those first twain, Or see but accidents those \
twain produce. A property is that which not at all Can be disjoined and \
severed from a thing Without a fatal dissolution: such, Weight to the rocks, \
heat to the fire, and flow To the wide waters, touch to corporal things, \
Intangibility to the viewless void. But state of slavery, pauperhood, and \
wealth, Freedom, and war, and concord, and all else Which come and go whilst \
nature stands the same, We're wont, and rightly, to call accidents. Even time \
exists not of itself; but sense Reads out of things what happened long ago, \
What presses now, and what shall follow after: No man, we must admit, feels \
time itself, Disjoined from motion and repose of things. Thus, when they say \
there \"is\" the ravishment Of Princess Helen, \"is\" the siege and sack Of \
Trojan Town, look out, they force us not To admit these acts existent by \
themselves, Merely because those races of mankind (Of whom these acts were \
accidents) long since Irrevocable age has borne away: For all past actions \
may be said to be But accidents, in one way, of mankind,- In other, of some \
region of the world. Add, too, had been no matter, and no room Wherein all \
things go on, the fire of love Upblown by that fair form, the glowing coal \
Under the Phrygian Alexander's breast, Had ne'er enkindled that renowned \
strife Of savage war, nor had the wooden horse Involved in flames old \
Pergama, by a birth At midnight of a brood of the Hellenes. And thus thou \
canst remark that every act At bottom exists not of itself, nor is As body \
is, nor has like name with void; But rather of sort more fitly to be called \
An accident of body, and of place Wherein all things go on. CHARACTER OF THE \
ATOMS Bodies, again, Are partly primal germs of things, and partly Unions \
deriving from the primal germs. And those which are the primal germs of \
things No power can quench; for in the end they conquer By their own \
solidness; though hard it be To think that aught in things has solid frame; \
For lightnings pass, no less than voice and shout, Through hedging walls of \
houses, and the iron White-dazzles in the fire, and rocks will burn With \
exhalations fierce and burst asunder. Totters the rigid gold dissolved in \
heat; The ice of bronze melts conquered in the flame; Warmth and the piercing \
cold through silver seep, Since, with the cups held rightly in the hand, We \
oft feel both, as from above is poured The dew of waters between their \
shining sides: So true it is no solid form is found. But yet because true \
reason and nature of things Constrain us, come, whilst in few verses now I \
disentangle how there still exist Bodies of solid, everlasting frame- The \
seeds of things, the primal germs we teach, Whence all creation around us \
came to be. First since we know a twofold nature exists, Of things, both \
twain and utterly unlike- Body, and place in which an things go on- Then each \
must be both for and through itself, And all unmixed: where'er be empty \
space, There body's not; and so where body bides, There not at all exists the \
void inane. Thus primal bodies are solid, without a void. But since there's \
void in all begotten things, All solid matter must be round the same; Nor, by \
true reason canst thou prove aught hides And holds a void within its body, \
unless Thou grant what holds it be a solid. Know, That which can hold a void \
of things within Can be naught else than matter in union knit. Thus matter, \
consisting of a solid frame, Hath power to be eternal, though all else, \
Though all creation, be dissolved away. Again, were naught of empty and \
inane, The world were then a solid; as, without Some certain bodies to fill \
the places held, The world that is were but a vacant void. And so, \
infallibly, alternate-wise Body and void are still distinguished, Since \
nature knows no wholly full nor void. There are, then, certain bodies, \
possessed of power To vary forever the empty and the full; And these can nor \
be sundered from without By beats and blows, nor from within be torn By \
penetration, nor be overthrown By any assault soever through the world- For \
without void, naught can be crushed, it seems, Nor broken, nor severed by a \
cut in twain, Nor can it take the damp, or seeping cold Or piercing fire, \
those old destroyers three; But the more void within a thing, the more \
Entirely it totters at their sure assault. Thus if first bodies be, as I have \
taught, Solid, without a void, they must be then Eternal; and, if matter \
ne'er had been Eternal, long ere now had all things gone Back into nothing \
utterly, and all We see around from nothing had been born- But since I taught \
above that naught can be From naught created, nor the once begotten To naught \
be summoned back, these primal germs Must have an immortality of frame. And \
into these must each thing be resolved, When comes its supreme hour, that \
thus there be At hand the stuff for plenishing the world. So primal germs \
have solid singleness Nor otherwise could they have been conserved Through \
aeons and infinity of time For the replenishment of wasted worlds. Once more, \
if nature had given a scope for things To be forever broken more and more, By \
now the bodies of matter would have been So far reduced by breakings in old \
days That from them nothing could, at season fixed, Be born, and arrive its \
prime and top of life. For, lo, each thing is quicker marred than made; And \
so whate'er the long infinitude Of days and all fore-passed time would now By \
this have broken and ruined and dissolved, That same could ne'er in all \
remaining time Be builded up for plenishing the world. But mark: infallibly a \
fixed bound Remaineth stablished 'gainst their breaking down; Since we behold \
each thing soever renewed, And unto all, their seasons, after their kind, \
Wherein they arrive the flower of their age. Again, if bounds have not been \
set against The breaking down of this corporeal world, Yet must all bodies of \
whatever things Have still endured from everlasting time Unto this present, \
as not yet assailed By shocks of peril. But because the same Are, to thy \
thinking, of a nature frail, It ill accords that thus they could remain (As \
thus they do) through everlasting time, Vexed through the ages (as indeed \
they are) By the innumerable blows of chance. So in our programme of \
creation, mark How 'tis that, though the bodies of all stuff Are solid to the \
core, we yet explain The ways whereby some things are fashioned soft- Air, \
water, earth, and fiery exhalations- And by what force they function and go \
on: The fact is founded in the void of things. But if the primal germs \
themselves be soft, Reason cannot be brought to bear to show The ways whereby \
may be created these Great crags of basalt and the during iron; For their \
whole nature will profoundly lack The first foundations of a solid frame. But \
powerful in old simplicity, Abide the solid, the primeval germs; And by their \
combinations more condensed, All objects can be tightly knit and bound And \
made to show unconquerable strength. Again, since all things kind by kind \
obtain Fixed bounds of growing and conserving life; Since Nature hath \
inviolably decreed What each can do, what each can never do; Since naught is \
changed, but all things so abide That ever the variegated birds reveal The \
spots or stripes peculiar to their kind, Spring after spring: thus surely all \
that is Must be composed of matter immutable. For if the primal germs in any \
wise Were open to conquest and to change, 'twould be Uncertain also what \
could come to birth And what could not, and by what law to each Its scope \
prescribed, its boundary stone that clings So deep in Time. Nor could the \
generations Kind after kind so often reproduce The nature, habits, motions, \
ways of life, Of their progenitors. And then again, Since there is ever an \
extreme bounding point Of that first body which our senses now Cannot \
perceive: That bounding point indeed Exists without all parts, a minimum Of \
nature, nor was e'er a thing apart, As of itself,- nor shall hereafter be, \
Since 'tis itself still parcel of another, A first and single part, whence \
other parts And others similar in order lie In a packed phalanx, filling to \
the full The nature of first body: being thus Not self-existent, they must \
cleave to that From which in nowise they can sundered be. So primal germs \
have solid singleness, Which tightly packed and closely joined cohere By \
virtue of their minim particles- No compound by mere union of the same; But \
strong in their eternal singleness, Nature, reserving them as seeds for \
things, Permitteth naught of rupture or decrease. Moreover, were there not a \
minimum, The smallest bodies would have infinites, Since then a half-of-half \
could still be halved, With limitless division less and less. Then what the \
difference 'twixt the sum and least? None: for however infinite the sum, Yet \
even the smallest would consist the same Of infinite parts. But since true \
reason here Protests, denying that the mind can think it, Convinced thou must \
confess such things there are As have no parts, the minimums of nature. And \
since these are, likewise confess thou must That primal bodies are solid and \
eterne. Again, if Nature, creatress of all things, Were wont to force all \
things to be resolved Unto least parts, then would she not avail To reproduce \
from out them anything; Because whate'er is not endowed with parts Cannot \
possess those properties required Of generative stuff- divers connections, \
Weights, blows, encounters, motions, whereby things Forevermore have being \
and go on. CONFUTATION OF OTHER PHILOSOPHERS And on such grounds it is that \
those who held The stuff of things is fire, and out of fire Alone the cosmic \
sum is formed, are seen Mightily from true reason to have lapsed. Of whom, \
chief leader to do battle, comes That Heraclitus, famous for dark speech \
Among the silly, not the serious Greeks Who search for truth. For dolts are \
ever prone That to bewonder and adore which hides Beneath distorted words, \
holding that true Which sweetly tickles in their stupid ears, Or which is \
rouged in finely finished phrase. For how, I ask, can things so varied be, If \
formed of fire, single and pure? No whit 'Twould help for fire to be \
condensed or thinned, If all the parts of fire did still preserve But fire's \
own nature, seen before in gross. The heat were keener with the parts \
compressed, Milder, again, when severed or dispersed- And more than this thou \
canst conceive of naught That from such causes could become; much less Might \
earth's variety of things be born From any fires soever, dense or rare. This \
too: if they suppose a void in things, Then fires can be condensed and still \
left rare; But since they see such opposites of thought Rising against them, \
and are loath to leave An unmixed void in things, they fear the steep And \
lose the road of truth. Nor do they see, That, if from things we take away \
the void, All things are then condensed, and out of all One body made, which \
has no power to dart Swiftly from out itself not anything- As throws the fire \
its light and warmth around, Giving thee proof its parts are not compact. But \
if perhaps they think, in other wise, Fires through their combinations can be \
quenched And change their substance, very well: behold, If fire shall spare \
to do so in no part, Then heat will perish utterly and all, And out of \
nothing would the world be formed. For change in anything from out its bounds \
Means instant death of that which was before; And thus a somewhat must \
persist unharmed Amid the world, lest all return to naught, And, born from \
naught, abundance thrive anew. Now since indeed there are those surest bodies \
Which keep their nature evermore the same, Upon whose going out and coming in \
And changed order things their nature change, And all corporeal substances \
transformed, 'Tis thine to know those primal bodies, then, Are not of fire. \
For 'twere of no avail Should some depart and go away, and some Be added new, \
and some be changed in order, If still all kept their nature of old heat: For \
whatsoever they created then Would still in any case be only fire. The truth, \
I fancy, this: bodies there are Whose clashings, motions, order, posture, \
shapes Produce the fire and which, by order changed, Do change the nature of \
the thing produced, And are thereafter nothing like to fire Nor whatso else \
has power to send its bodies With impact touching on the senses' touch. \
Again, to say that all things are but fire And no true thing in number of all \
things Exists but fire, as this same fellow says, Seems crazed folly. For the \
man himself Against the senses by the senses fights, And hews at that through \
which is all belief, Through which indeed unto himself is known The thing he \
calls the fire. For, though he thinks The senses truly can perceive the fire, \
He thinks they cannot as regards all else, Which still are palpably as clear \
to sense- To me a thought inept and crazy too. For whither shall we make \
appeal? for what More certain than our senses can there be Whereby to mark \
asunder error and truth? Besides, why rather do away with all, And wish to \
allow heat only, then deny The fire and still allow all else to be?- Alike \
the madness either way it seems. Thus whosoe'er have held the stuff of things \
To be but fire, and out of fire the sum, And whosoever have constituted air \
As first beginning of begotten things, And all whoever have held that of \
itself Water alone contrives things, or that earth Createth all and changes \
things anew To divers natures, mightily they seem A long way to have wandered \
from the truth. Add, too, whoever make the primal stuff Twofold, by joining \
air to fire, and earth To water; add who deem that things can grow Out of the \
four- fire, earth, and breath, and rain; As first Empedocles of Acragas, Whom \
that three-cornered isle of all the lands Bore on her coasts, around which \
flows and flows In mighty bend and bay the Ionic seas, Splashing the brine \
from off their gray-green waves. Here, billowing onward through the narrow \
straits, Swift ocean cuts her boundaries from the shores Of the Italic \
mainland. Here the waste Charybdis; and here Aetna rumbles threats To gather \
anew such furies of its flames As with its force anew to vomit fires, Belched \
from its throat, and skyward bear anew Its lightnings' flash. And though for \
much she seem The mighty and the wondrous isle to men, Most rich in all good \
things, and fortified With generous strength of heroes, she hath ne'er \
Possessed within her aught of more renown, Nor aught more holy, wonderful, \
and dear Than this true man. Nay, ever so far and pure The lofty music of his \
breast divine Lifts up its voice and tells of glories found, That scarce he \
seems of human stock create. Yet he and those forementioned (known to be So \
far beneath him, less than he in all), Though, as discoverers of much goodly \
truth, They gave, as 'twere from out of the heart's own shrine, Responses \
holier and soundlier based Than ever the Pythia pronounced for men From out \
the triped and the Delphian laurel, Have still in matter of first-elements \
Made ruin of themselves, and, great men, great Indeed and heavy there for \
them the fall: First, because, banishing the void from things, They yet \
assign them motion, and allow Things soft and loosely textured to exist, As \
air, dew, fire, earth, animals, and grains, Without admixture of void amid \
their frame. Next, because, thinking there can be no end In cutting bodies \
down to less and less Nor pause established to their breaking up, They hold \
there is no minimum in things; Albeit we see the boundary point of aught Is \
that which to our senses seems its least, Whereby thou mayst conjecture, \
that, because The things thou canst not mark have boundary points, They \
surely have their minimums. Then, too, Since these philosophers ascribe to \
things Soft primal germs, which we behold to be Of birth and body mortal, \
thus, throughout, The sum of things must be returned to naught, And, born \
from naught, abundance thrive anew- Thou seest how far each doctrine stands \
from truth. And, next, these bodies are among themselves In many ways poisons \
and foes to each, Wherefore their congress will destroy them quite Or drive \
asunder as we see in storms Rains, winds, and lightnings all asunder fly. \
Thus too, if all things are create of four, And all again dissolved into the \
four, How can the four be called the primal germs Of things, more than all \
things themselves be thought, By retroversion, primal germs of them? For ever \
alternately are both begot, With interchange of nature and aspect From \
immemorial time. But if percase Thou think'st the frame of fire and earth, \
the air, The dew of water can in such wise meet As not by mingling to resign \
their nature, From them for thee no world can be create- No thing of breath, \
no stock or stalk of tree: In the wild congress of this varied heap Each \
thing its proper nature will display, And air will palpably be seen mixed up \
With earth together, unquenched heat with water. But primal germs in bringing \
things to birth Must have a latent, unseen quality, Lest some outstanding \
alien element Confuse and minish in the thing create Its proper being. But \
these men begin From heaven, and from its fires; and first they feign That \
fire will turn into the winds of air, Next, that from air the rain begotten \
is, And earth created out of rain, and then That all, reversely, are returned \
from earth- The moisture first, then air thereafter heat- And that these same \
ne'er cease in interchange, To go their ways from heaven to earth, from earth \
Unto the stars of the aethereal world- Which in no wise at all the germs can \
do. Since an immutable somewhat still must be, Lest all things utterly be \
sped to naught; For change in anything from out its bounds Means instant \
death of that which was before. Wherefore, since those things, mentioned \
heretofore, Suffer a changed state, they must derive From others ever \
unconvertible, Lest an things utterly return to naught. Then why not rather \
presuppose there be Bodies with such a nature furnished forth That, if \
perchance they have created fire, Can still (by virtue of a few withdrawn, Or \
added few, and motion and order changed) Fashion the winds of air, and thus \
all things Forevermore be interchanged with all? \"But facts in proof are \
manifest,\" thou sayest, \"That all things grow into the winds of air And \
forth from earth are nourished, and unless The season favour at propitious \
hour With rains enough to set the trees a-reel Under the soak of bulking \
thunderheads, And sun, for its share, foster and give heat, No grains, nor \
trees, nor breathing things can grow.\" True- and unless hard food and \
moisture soft Recruited man, his frame would waste away, And life dissolve \
from out his thews and bones; For out of doubt recruited and fed are we By \
certain things, as other things by others. Because in many ways the many \
germs Common to many things are mixed in things, No wonder 'tis that \
therefore divers things By divers things are nourished. And, again, Often it \
matters vastly with what others, In what positions the primordial germs Are \
bound together, and what motions, too, They give and get among themselves; \
for these Same germs do put together sky, sea, lands, Rivers, and sun, \
grains, trees, and breathing things, But yet commixed they are in divers \
modes With divers things, forever as they move. Nay, thou beholdest in our \
verses here Elements many, common to many worlds, Albeit thou must confess \
each verse, each word From one another differs both in sense And ring of \
sound- so much the elements Can bring about by change of order alone. But \
those which are the primal germs of things Have power to work more \
combinations still, Whence divers things can be produced in turn. Now let us \
also take for scrutiny The homeomeria of Anaxagoras, So called by Greeks, for \
which our pauper-speech Yieldeth no name in the Italian tongue, Although the \
thing itself is not o'erhard For explanation. First, then, when he speaks Of \
this homeomeria of things, he thinks Bones to be sprung from littlest bones \
minute, And from minute and littlest flesh all flesh, And blood created out \
of drops of blood, Conceiving gold compact of grains of gold, And earth \
concreted out of bits of earth, Fire made of fires, and water out of waters, \
Feigning the like with all the rest of stuff. Yet he concedes not any void in \
things, Nor any limit to cutting bodies down. Wherefore to me he seems on \
both accounts To err no less than those we named before. Add too: these germs \
he feigns are far too frail- If they be germs primordial furnished forth With \
but same nature as the things themselves, And travail and perish equally with \
those, And no rein curbs them from annihilation. For which will last against \
the grip and crush Under the teeth of death? the fire? the moist? Or else the \
air? which then? the blood? the bones? No one, methinks, when every thing \
will be At bottom as mortal as whate'er we mark To perish by force before our \
gazing eyes. But my appeal is to the proofs above That things cannot fall \
back to naught, nor yet From naught increase. And now again, since food \
Augments and nourishes the human frame, 'Tis thine to know our veins and \
blood and bones And thews are formed of particles unlike To them in kind; or \
if they say all foods Are of mixed substance having in themselves Small \
bodies of thews, and bones, and also veins And particles of blood, then every \
food, Solid or liquid, must itself be thought As made and mixed of things \
unlike in kind- Of bones, of thews, of ichor and of blood. Again, if all the \
bodies which upgrow From earth, are first within the earth, then earth Must \
be compound of alien substances. Which spring and bloom abroad from out the \
earth. Transfer the argument, and thou may'st use The selfsame words: if \
flame and smoke and ash Still lurk unseen within the wood, the wood Must be \
compound of alien substances Which spring from out the wood. Right here \
remains A certain slender means to skulk from truth, Which Anaxagoras takes \
unto himself, Who holds that all things lurk commixed with all While that one \
only comes to view, of which The bodies exceed in number all the rest, And \
lie more close to hand and at the fore- A notion banished from true reason \
far. For then 'twere meet that kernels of the grains Should oft, when \
crunched between the might of stones, Give forth a sign of blood, or of aught \
else Which in our human frame is fed; and that Rock rubbed on rock should \
yield a gory ooze. Likewise the herbs ought oft to give forth drops Of sweet \
milk, flavoured like the uddered sheep's; Indeed we ought to find, when \
crumbling up The earthy clods, there herbs, and grains, and leaves, All sorts \
dispersed minutely in the soil; Lastly we ought to find in cloven wood Ashes \
and smoke and bits of fire there hid. But since fact teaches this is not the \
case, 'Tis thine to know things are not mixed with things Thuswise; but \
seeds, common to many things, Commixed in many ways, must lurk in things. \
\"But often it happens on skiey hills\" thou sayest, \"That neighbouring tops \
of lofty trees are rubbed One against other, smote by the blustering south, \
Till all ablaze with bursting flower of flame.\" Good sooth- yet fire is not \
ingraft in wood, But many are the seeds of heat, and when Rubbing together \
they together flow, They start the conflagrations in the forests. Whereas if \
flame, already fashioned, lay Stored up within the forests, then the fires \
Could not for any time be kept unseen, But would be laying all the wildwood \
waste And burning all the boscage. Now dost see (Even as we said a little \
space above) How mightily it matters with what others, In what positions \
these same primal germs Are bound together? And what motions, too, They give \
and get among themselves? how, hence, The same, if altered 'mongst \
themselves, can body Both igneous and ligneous objects forth- Precisely as \
these words themselves are made By somewhat altering their elements, Although \
we mark with name indeed distinct The igneous from the ligneous. Once again, \
If thou suppose whatever thou beholdest, Among all visible objects, cannot \
be, Unless thou feign bodies of matter endowed With a like nature,- by thy \
vain device For thee will perish all the germs of things: 'Twill come to pass \
they'll laugh aloud, like men, Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth, Or moisten \
with salty tear-drops cheeks and chins. THE INFINITY OF THE UNIVERSE Now \
learn of what remains! More keenly hear! And for myself, my mind is not \
deceived How dark it is: But the large hope of praise Hath strook with \
pointed thyrsus through my heart; On the same hour hath strook into my breast \
Sweet love of the Muses, wherewith now instinct, I wander afield, thriving in \
sturdy thought, Through unpathed haunts of the Pierides, Trodden by step of \
none before. I joy To come on undefiled fountains there, To drain them deep; \
I joy to pluck new flowers, To seek for this my head a signal crown From \
regions where the Muses never yet Have garlanded the temples of a man: First, \
since I teach concerning mighty things, And go right on to loose from round \
the mind The tightened coils of dread religion; Next, since, concerning \
themes so dark, I frame Songs so pellucid, touching all throughout Even with \
the Muses' charm- which, as 'twould seem, Is not without a reasonable ground: \
But as physicians, when they seek to give Young boys the nauseous wormwood, \
first do touch The brim around the cup with the sweet juice And yellow of the \
honey, in order that The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled As far as the \
lips, and meanwhile swallow down The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though \
befooled, Be yet not merely duped, but rather thus Grow strong again with \
recreated health: So now I too (since this my doctrine seems In general \
somewhat woeful unto those Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd \
Starts back from it in horror) have desired To expound our doctrine unto thee \
in song Soft-speaking and Pierian, and, as 'twere, To touch it with sweet \
honey of the Muse- If by such method haply I might hold The mind of thee upon \
these lines of ours, Till thou see through the nature of all things, And how \
exists the interwoven frame. But since I've taught that bodies of matter, \
made Completely solid, hither and thither fly Forevermore unconquered through \
all time, Now come, and whether to the sum of them There be a limit or be \
none, for thee Let us unfold; likewise what has been found To be the wide \
inane, or room, or space Wherein all things soever do go on, Let us examine \
if it finite be All and entire, or reach unmeasured round And downward an \
illimitable profound. Thus, then, the All that is is limited In no one region \
of its onward paths, For then 'tmust have forever its beyond. And a beyond \
'tis seen can never be For aught, unless still further on there be A somewhat \
somewhere that may bound the same- So that the thing be seen still on to \
where The nature of sensation of that thing Can follow it no longer. Now \
because Confess we must there's naught beside the sum, There's no beyond, and \
so it lacks all end. It matters nothing where thou post thyself, In \
whatsoever regions of the same; Even any place a man has set him down Still \
leaves about him the unbounded all Outward in all directions; or, supposing A \
moment the all of space finite to be, If some one farthest traveller runs \
forth Unto the extreme coasts and throws ahead A flying spear, is't then thy \
wish to think It goes, hurled off amain, to where 'twas sent And shoots afar, \
or that some object there Can thwart and stop it? For the one or other Thou \
must admit and take. Either of which Shuts off escape for thee, and does \
compel That thou concede the all spreads everywhere, Owning no confines. \
Since whether there be Aught that may block and check it so it comes Not \
where 'twas sent, nor lodges in its goal, Or whether borne along, in either \
view 'Thas started not from any end. And so I'll follow on, and whereso'er \
thou set The extreme coasts, I'll query, \"what becomes Thereafter of thy \
spear?\" 'Twill come to pass That nowhere can a world's-end be, and that The \
chance for further flight prolongs forever The flight itself. Besides, were \
all the space Of the totality and sum shut in With fixed coasts, and bounded \
everywhere, Then would the abundance of world's matter flow Together by solid \
weight from everywhere Still downward to the bottom of the world, Nor aught \
could happen under cope of sky, Nor could there be a sky at all or sun- \
Indeed, where matter all one heap would lie, By having settled during \
infinite time. But in reality, repose is given Unto no bodies 'mongst the \
elements, Because there is no bottom whereunto They might, as 'twere, \
together flow, and where They might take up their undisturbed abodes. In \
endless motion everything goes on Forevermore; out of all regions, even Out \
of the pit below, from forth the vast, Are hurtled bodies evermore supplied. \
The nature of room, the space of the abyss Is such that even the flashing \
thunderbolts Can neither speed upon their courses through, Gliding across \
eternal tracts of time, Nor, further, bring to pass, as on they run, That \
they may bate their journeying one whit: Such huge abundance spreads for \
things around- Room off to every quarter, without end. Lastly, before our \
very eyes is seen Thing to bound thing: air hedges hill from hill, And \
mountain walls hedge air; land ends the sea, And sea in turn all lands; but \
for the All Truly is nothing which outside may bound. That, too, the sum of \
things itself may not Have power to fix a measure of its own, Great nature \
guards, she who compels the void To bound all body, as body all the void, \
Thus rendering by these alternates the whole An infinite; or else the one or \
other, Being unbounded by the other, spreads, Even by its single nature, \
ne'ertheless Immeasurably forth.... Nor sea, nor earth, nor shining vaults of \
sky, Nor breed of mortals, nor holy limbs of gods Could keep their place \
least portion of an hour: For, driven apart from out its meetings fit, The \
stock of stuff, dissolved, would be borne Along the illimitable inane afar, \
Or rather, in fact, would ne'er have once combined And given a birth to \
aught, since, scattered wide, It could not be united. For of truth Neither by \
counsel did the primal germs 'Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind, \
Each in its proper place; nor did they make, Forsooth, a compact how each \
germ should move; But since, being many and changed in many modes Along the \
All, they're driven abroad and vexed By blow on blow, even from all time of \
old, They thus at last, after attempting all The kinds of motion and \
conjoining, come Into those great arrangements out of which This sum of \
things established is create, By which, moreover, through the mighty years, \
It is preserved, when once it has been thrown Into the proper motions, \
bringing to pass That ever the streams refresh the greedy main With \
river-waves abounding, and that earth, Lapped in warm exhalations of the sun, \
Renews her broods, and that the lusty race Of breathing creatures bears and \
blooms, and that The gliding fires of ether are alive- What still the primal \
germs nowise could do, Unless from out the infinite of space Could come \
supply of matter, whence in season They're wont whatever losses to repair. \
For as the nature of breathing creatures wastes, Losing its body, when \
deprived of food: So all things have to be dissolved as soon As matter, \
diverted by what means soever From off its course, shall fail to be on hand. \
Nor can the blows from outward still conserve, On every side, whatever sum of \
a world Has been united in a whole. They can Indeed, by frequent beating, \
check a part, Till others arriving may fulfil the sum; But meanwhile often \
are they forced to spring Rebounding back, and, as they spring, to yield, \
Unto those elements whence a world derives, Room and a time for flight, \
permitting them To be from off the massy union borne Free and afar. \
Wherefore, again, again: Needs must there come a many for supply; And also, \
that the blows themselves shall be Unfailing ever, must there ever be An \
infinite force of matter all sides round. And in these problems, shrink, my \
Memmius, far From yielding faith to that notorious talk: That all things \
inward to the centre press; And thus the nature of the world stands firm With \
never blows from outward, nor can be Nowhere disparted- since all height and \
depth Have always inward to the centre pressed (If thou art ready to believe \
that aught Itself can rest upon itself ); or that The ponderous bodies which \
be under earth Do all press upwards and do come to rest Upon the earth, in \
some way upside down, Like to those images of things we see At present \
through the waters. They contend, With like procedure, that all breathing \
things Head downward roam about, and yet cannot Tumble from earth to realms \
of sky below, No more than these our bodies wing away Spontaneously to vaults \
of sky above; That, when those creatures look upon the sun, We view the \
constellations of the night; And that with us the seasons of the sky They \
thus alternately divide, and thus Do pass the night coequal to our days, But \
a vain error has given these dreams to fools, Which they've embraced with \
reasoning perverse For centre none can be where world is still Boundless, nor \
yet, if now a centre were, Could aught take there a fixed position more Than \
for some other cause 'tmight be dislodged. For all of room and space we call \
the void Must both through centre and non-centre yield Alike to weights \
where'er their motions tend. Nor is there any place, where, when they've \
come, Bodies can be at standstill in the void, Deprived of force of weight; \
nor yet may void Furnish support to any,- nay, it must, True to its bent of \
nature, still give way. Thus in such manner not at all can things Be held in \
union, as if overcome By craving for a centre. But besides, Seeing they feign \
that not all bodies press To centre inward, rather only those Of earth and \
water (liquid of the sea, And the big billows from the mountain slopes, And \
whatsoever are encased, as 'twere, In earthen body), contrariwise, they teach \
How the thin air, and with it the hot fire, Is borne asunder from the centre, \
and how, For this all ether quivers with bright stars, And the sun's flame \
along the blue is fed (Because the heat, from out the centre flying, All \
gathers there), and how, again, the boughs Upon the tree-tops could not \
sprout their leaves, Unless, little by little, from out the earth For each \
were nutriment... Lest, after the manner of the winged flames, The ramparts \
of the world should flee away, Dissolved amain throughout the mighty void, \
And lest all else should likewise follow after, Aye, lest the thundering \
vaults of heaven should burst And splinter upward, and the earth forthwith \
Withdraw from under our feet, and all its bulk, Among its mingled wrecks and \
those of heaven, With slipping asunder of the primal seeds, Should pass, \
along the immeasurable inane, Away forever, and, that instant, naught Of \
wrack and remnant would be left, beside The desolate space, and germs \
invisible. For on whatever side thou deemest first The primal bodies lacking, \
lo, that side Will be for things the very door of death: Wherethrough the \
throng of matter all will dash, Out and abroad. These points, if thou wilt \
ponder, Then, with but paltry trouble led along... For one thing after other \
will grow clear, Nor shall the blind night rob thee of the road, To hinder \
thy gaze on nature's Farthest-forth. Thus things for things shall kindle \
torches new. BOOK II PROEM 'Tis sweet, when, down the mighty main, the winds \
Roll up its waste of waters, from the land To watch another's labouring \
anguish far, Not that we joyously delight that man Should thus be smitten, \
but because 'tis sweet To mark what evils we ourselves be spared; 'Tis sweet, \
again, to view the mighty strife Of armies embattled yonder o'er the plains, \
Ourselves no sharers in the peril; but naught There is more goodly than to \
hold the high Serene plateaus, well fortressed by the wise, Whence thou \
may'st look below on other men And see them ev'rywhere wand'ring, all \
dispersed In their lone seeking for the road of life; Rivals in genius, or \
emulous in rank, Pressing through days and nights with hugest toil For \
summits of power and mastery of the world. O wretched minds of men! O blinded \
hearts! In how great perils, in what darks of life Are spent the human years, \
however brief!- O not to see that nature for herself Barks after nothing, \
save that pain keep off, Disjoined from the body, and that mind enjoy \
Delightsome feeling, far from care and fear! Therefore we see that our \
corporeal life Needs little, altogether, and only such As takes the pain \
away, and can besides Strew underneath some number of delights. More grateful \
'tis at times (for nature craves No artifice nor luxury), if forsooth There \
be no golden images of boys Along the halls, with right hands holding out The \
lamps ablaze, the lights for evening feasts, And if the house doth glitter \
not with gold Nor gleam with silver, and to the lyre resound No fretted and \
gilded ceilings overhead, Yet still to lounge with friends in the soft grass \
Beside a river of water, underneath A big tree's boughs, and merrily to \
refresh Our frames, with no vast outlay- most of all If the weather is \
laughing and the times of the year Besprinkle the green of the grass around \
with flowers. Nor yet the quicker will hot fevers go, If on a pictured \
tapestry thou toss, Or purple robe, than if 'tis thine to lie Upon the poor \
man's bedding. Wherefore, since Treasure, nor rank, nor glory of a reign \
Avail us naught for this our body, thus Reckon them likewise nothing for the \
mind: Save then perchance, when thou beholdest forth Thy legions swarming \
round the Field of Mars, Rousing a mimic warfare- either side Strengthened \
with large auxiliaries and horse, Alike equipped with arms, alike inspired; \
Or save when also thou beholdest forth Thy fleets to swarm, deploying down \
the sea: For then, by such bright circumstance abashed, Religion pales and \
flees thy mind; O then The fears of death leave heart so free of care. But if \
we note how all this pomp at last Is but a drollery and a mocking sport, And \
of a truth man's dread, with cares at heels, Dreads not these sounds of arms, \
these savage swords But among kings and lords of all the world Mingles \
undaunted, nor is overawed By gleam of gold nor by the splendour bright Of \
purple robe, canst thou then doubt that this Is aught, but power of \
thinking?- when, besides The whole of life but labours in the dark. For just \
as children tremble and fear all In the viewless dark, so even we at times \
Dread in the light so many things that be No whit more fearsome than what \
children feign, Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark. This terror then, \
this darkness of the mind, Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light, Nor \
glittering arrows of morning can disperse, But only nature's aspect and her \
law. ATOMIC MOTIONS Now come: I will untangle for thy steps Now by what \
motions the begetting bodies Of the world-stuff beget the varied world, And \
then forever resolve it when begot, And by what force they are constrained to \
this, And what the speed appointed unto them Wherewith to travel down the \
vast inane: Do thou remember to yield thee to my words. For truly matter \
coheres not, crowds not tight, Since we behold each thing to wane away, And \
we observe how all flows on and off, As 'twere, with age-old time, and from \
our eyes How eld withdraws each object at the end, Albeit the sum is seen to \
bide the same, Unharmed, because these motes that leave each thing Diminish \
what they part from, but endow With increase those to which in turn they \
come, Constraining these to wither in old age, And those to flower at the \
prime (and yet Biding not long among them). Thus the sum Forever is \
replenished, and we live As mortals by eternal give and take. The nations \
wax, the nations wane away; In a brief space the generations pass, And like \
to runners hand the lamp of life One unto other. But if thou believe That the \
primordial germs of things can stop, And in their stopping give new motions \
birth, Afar thou wanderest from the road of truth. For since they wander \
through the void inane, All the primordial germs of things must needs Be \
borne along, either by weight their own, Or haply by another's blow without. \
For, when, in their incessancy so oft They meet and clash, it comes to pass \
amain They leap asunder, face to face: not strange- Being most hard, and \
solid in their weights, And naught opposing motion, from behind. And that \
more clearly thou perceive how all These mites of matter are darted round \
about, Recall to mind how nowhere in the sum Of All exists a bottom,- nowhere \
is A realm of rest for primal bodies; since (As amply shown and proved by \
reason sure) Space has no bound nor measure, and extends Unmetered forth in \
all directions round. Since this stands certain, thus 'tis out of doubt No \
rest is rendered to the primal bodies Along the unfathomable inane; but \
rather, Inveterately plied by motions mixed, Some, at their jamming, bound \
aback and leave Huge gaps between, and some from off the blow Are hurried \
about with spaces small between. And all which, brought together with slight \
gaps, In more condensed union bound aback, Linked by their own all \
inter-tangled shapes,- These form the irrefragable roots of rocks And the \
brute bulks of iron, and what else Is of their kind... The rest leap far \
asunder, far recoil, Leaving huge gaps between: and these supply For us thin \
air and splendour-lights of the sun. And many besides wander the mighty void- \
Cast back from unions of existing things, Nowhere accepted in the universe, \
And nowise linked in motions to the rest. And of this fact (as I record it \
here) An image, a type goes on before our eyes Present each moment; for \
behold whenever The sun's light and the rays, let in, pour down Across dark \
halls of houses: thou wilt see The many mites in many a manner mixed Amid a \
void in the very light of the rays, And battling on, as in eternal strife, \
And in battalions contending without halt, In meetings, partings, harried up \
and down. From this thou mayest conjecture of what sort The ceaseless tossing \
of primordial seeds Amid the mightier void- at least so far As small affair \
can for a vaster serve, And by example put thee on the spoor Of knowledge. \
For this reason too 'tis fit Thou turn thy mind the more unto these bodies \
Which here are witnessed tumbling in the light: Namely, because such \
tumblings are a sign That motions also of the primal stuff Secret and \
viewless lurk beneath, behind. For thou wilt mark here many a speck, impelled \
By viewless blows, to change its little course, And beaten backwards to \
return again, Hither and thither in all directions round. Lo, all their \
shifting movement is of old, From the primeval atoms; for the same Primordial \
seeds of things first move of self, And then those bodies built of unions \
small And nearest, as it were, unto the powers Of the primeval atoms, are \
stirred up By impulse of those atoms' unseen blows, And these thereafter goad \
the next in size: Thus motion ascends from the primevals on, And stage by \
stage emerges to our sense, Until those objects also move which we Can mark \
in sunbeams, though it not appears What blows do urge them. Herein wonder not \
How 'tis that, while the seeds of things are all Moving forever, the sum yet \
seems to stand Supremely still, except in cases where A thing shows motion of \
its frame as whole. For far beneath the ken of senses lies The nature of \
those ultimates of the world; And so, since those themselves thou canst not \
see, Their motion also must they veil from men- For mark, indeed, how things \
we can see, oft Yet hide their motions, when afar from us Along the distant \
landscape. Often thus, Upon a hillside will the woolly flocks Be cropping \
their goodly food and creeping about Whither the summons of the grass, \
begemmed With the fresh dew, is calling, and the lambs, Well filled, are \
frisking, locking horns in sport: Yet all for us seem blurred and blent afar- \
A glint of white at rest on a green hill. Again, when mighty legions, \
marching round, Fill all the quarters of the plains below, Rousing a mimic \
warfare, there the sheen Shoots up the sky, and all the fields about Glitter \
with brass, and from beneath, a sound Goes forth from feet of stalwart \
soldiery, And mountain walls, smote by the shouting, send The voices onward \
to the stars of heaven, And hither and thither darts the cavalry, And of a \
sudden down the midmost fields Charges with onset stout enough to rock The \
solid earth: and yet some post there is Up the high mountains, viewed from \
which they seem To stand- a gleam at rest along the plains. Now what the \
speed to matter's atoms given Thou mayest in few, my Memmius, learn from \
this: When first the dawn is sprinkling with new light The lands, and all the \
breed of birds abroad Flit round the trackless forests, with liquid notes \
Filling the regions along the mellow air, We see 'tis forthwith manifest to \
man How suddenly the risen sun is wont At such an hour to overspread and \
clothe The whole with its own splendour; but the sun's Warm exhalations and \
this serene light Travel not down an empty void; and thus They are compelled \
more slowly to advance, Whilst, as it were, they cleave the waves of air; Nor \
one by one travel these particles Of the warm exhalations, but are all \
Entangled and enmassed, whereby at once Each is restrained by each, and from \
without Checked, till compelled more slowly to advance. But the primordial \
atoms with their old Simple solidity, when forth they travel Along the empty \
void, all undelayed By aught outside them there, and they, each one Being one \
unit from nature of its parts, Are borne to that one place on which they \
strive Still to lay hold, must then, beyond a doubt, Outstrip in speed, and \
be more swiftly borne Than light of sun, and over regions rush, Of space much \
vaster, in the self-same time The sun's effulgence widens round the sky. Nor \
to pursue the atoms one by one, To see the law whereby each thing goes on. \
But some men, ignorant of matter, think, Opposing this, that not without the \
gods, In such adjustment to our human ways, Can nature change the seasons of \
the years, And bring to birth the grains and all of else To which divine \
Delight, the guide of life, Persuades mortality and leads it on, That, \
through her artful blandishments of love, It propagate the generations still, \
Lest humankind should perish. When they feign That gods have stablished all \
things but for man, They seem in all ways mightily to lapse From reason's \
truth: for ev'n if ne'er I knew What seeds primordial are, yet would I dare \
This to affirm, ev'n from deep judgment based Upon the ways and conduct of \
the skies- This to maintain by many a fact besides- That in no wise the \
nature of the world For us was builded by a power divine- So great the faults \
it stands encumbered with: The which, my Memmius, later on, for thee We will \
clear up. Now as to what remains Concerning motions we'll unfold our thought. \
Now is the place, meseems, in these affairs To prove for thee this too: \
nothing corporeal Of its own force can e'er be upward borne, Or upward go- \
nor let the bodies of flames Deceive thee here: for they engendered are With \
urge to upwards, taking thus increase, Whereby grow upwards shining grains \
and trees, Though all the weight within them downward bears. Nor, when the \
fires will leap from under round The roofs of houses, and swift flame laps up \
Timber and beam, 'tis then to be supposed They act of own accord, no force \
beneath To urge them up. 'Tis thus that blood, discharged From out our \
bodies, spurts its jets aloft And spatters gore. And hast thou never marked \
With what a force the water will disgorge Timber and beam? The deeper, \
straight and down, We push them in, and, many though we be, The more we press \
with main and toil, the more The water vomits up and flings them back, That, \
more than half their length, they there emerge, Rebounding. Yet we never \
doubt, meseems, That all the weight within them downward bears Through empty \
void. Well, in like manner, flames Ought also to be able, when pressed out, \
Through winds of air to rise aloft, even though The weight within them strive \
to draw them down. Hast thou not seen, sweeping so far and high, The meteors, \
midnight flambeaus of the sky, How after them they draw long trails of flame \
Wherever Nature gives a thoroughfare? How stars and constellations drop to \
earth, Seest not? Nay, too, the sun from peak of heaven Sheds round to every \
quarter its large heat, And sows the new-ploughed intervales with light: Thus \
also sun's heat downward tends to earth. Athwart the rain thou seest the \
lightning fly; Now here, now there, bursting from out the clouds, The fires \
dash zig-zag- and that flaming power Falls likewise down to earth. In these \
affairs We wish thee also well aware of this: The atoms, as their own weight \
bears them down Plumb through the void, at scarce determined times, In scarce \
determined places, from their course Decline a little- call it, so to speak, \
Mere changed trend. For were it not their wont Thuswise to swerve, down would \
they fall, each one, Like drops of rain, through the unbottomed void; And \
then collisions ne'er could be nor blows Among the primal elements; and thus \
Nature would never have created aught. But, if perchance be any that believe \
The heavier bodies, as more swiftly borne Plumb down the void, are able from \
above To strike the lighter, thus engendering blows Able to cause those \
procreant motions, far From highways of true reason they retire. For \
whatsoever through the waters fall, Or through thin air, must quicken their \
descent, Each after its weight- on this account, because Both bulk of water \
and the subtle air By no means can retard each thing alike, But give more \
quick before the heavier weight; But contrariwise the empty void cannot, On \
any side, at any time, to aught Oppose resistance, but will ever yield, True \
to its bent of nature. Wherefore all, With equal speed, though equal not in \
weight, Must rush, borne downward through the still inane. Thus ne'er at all \
have heavier from above Been swift to strike the lighter, gendering strokes \
Which cause those divers motions, by whose means Nature transacts her work. \
And so I say, The atoms must a little swerve at times- But only the least, \
lest we should seem to feign Motions oblique, and fact refute us there. For \
this we see forthwith is manifest: Whatever the weight, it can't obliquely \
go, Down on its headlong journey from above, At least so far as thou canst \
mark; but who Is there can mark by sense that naught can swerve At all aside \
from off its road's straight line? Again, if ev'r all motions are co-linked, \
And from the old ever arise the new In fixed order, and primordial seeds \
Produce not by their swerving some new start Of motion to sunder the \
covenants of fate, That cause succeed not cause from everlasting, Whence this \
free will for creatures o'er the lands, Whence is it wrested from the fates,- \
this will Whereby we step right forward where desire Leads each man on, \
whereby the same we swerve In motions, not as at some fixed time, Nor at some \
fixed line of space, but where The mind itself has urged? For out of doubt In \
these affairs 'tis each man's will itself That gives the start, and hence \
throughout our limbs Incipient motions are diffused. Again, Dost thou not \
see, when, at a point of time, The bars are opened, how the eager strength Of \
horses cannot forward break as soon As pants their mind to do? For it \
behooves That all the stock of matter, through the frame, Be roused, in order \
that, through every joint, Aroused, it press and follow mind's desire; So \
thus thou seest initial motion's gendered From out the heart, aye, verily, \
proceeds First from the spirit's will, whence at the last 'Tis given forth \
through joints and body entire. Quite otherwise it is, when forth we move, \
Impelled by a blow of another's mighty powers And mighty urge; for then 'tis \
clear enough All matter of our total body goes, Hurried along, against our \
own desire- Until the will has pulled upon the reins And checked it back, \
throughout our members all; At whose arbitrament indeed sometimes The stock \
of matter's forced to change its path, Throughout our members and throughout \
our joints, And, after being forward cast, to be Reined up, whereat it \
settles back again. So seest thou not, how, though external force Drive men \
before, and often make them move, Onward against desire, and headlong \
snatched, Yet is there something in these breasts of ours Strong to combat, \
strong to withstand the same?- Wherefore no less within the primal seeds Thou \
must admit, besides all blows and weight, Some other cause of motion, whence \
derives This power in us inborn, of some free act.- Since naught from nothing \
can become, we see. For weight prevents all things should come to pass \
Through blows, as 'twere, by some external force; But that man's mind itself \
in all it does Hath not a fixed necessity within, Nor is not, like a \
conquered thing, compelled To bear and suffer,- this state comes to man From \
that slight swervement of the elements In no fixed line of space, in no fixed \
time. Nor ever was the stock of stuff more crammed, Nor ever, again, sundered \
by bigger gaps: For naught gives increase and naught takes away; On which \
account, just as they move to-day, The elemental bodies moved of old And \
shall the same hereafter evermore. And what was wont to be begot of old Shall \
be begotten under selfsame terms And grow and thrive in power, so far as \
given To each by Nature's changeless, old decrees. The sum of things there is \
no power can change, For naught exists outside, to which can flee Out of the \
world matter of any kind, Nor forth from which a fresh supply can spring, \
Break in upon the founded world, and change Whole nature of things, and turn \
their motions about. ATOMIC FORMS AND THEIR COMBINATIONS Now come, and next \
hereafter apprehend What sorts, how vastly different in form, How varied in \
multitudinous shapes they are- These old beginnings of the universe; Not in \
the sense that only few are furnished With one like form, but rather not at \
all In general have they likeness each with each, No marvel: since the stock \
of them's so great That there's no end (as I have taught) nor sum, They must \
indeed not one and all be marked By equal outline and by shape the same. \
Moreover, humankind, and the mute flocks Of scaly creatures swimming in the \
streams, And joyous herds around, and all the wild, And all the breeds of \
birds- both those that teem In gladsome regions of the water-haunts, About \
the river-banks and springs and pools, And those that throng, flitting from \
tree to tree, Through trackless woods- Go, take which one thou wilt, In any \
kind: thou wilt discover still Each from the other still unlike in shape. Nor \
in no other wise could offspring know Mother, nor mother offspring- which we \
see They yet can do, distinguished one from other, No less than human beings, \
by clear signs. Thus oft before fair temples of the gods, Beside the \
incense-burning altars slain, Drops down the yearling calf, from out its \
breast Breathing warm streams of blood; the orphaned mother, Ranging \
meanwhile green woodland pastures round, Knows well the footprints, pressed \
by cloven hoofs, With eyes regarding every spot about, For sight somewhere of \
youngling gone from her; And, stopping short, filleth the leafy lanes With \
her complaints; and oft she seeks again Within the stall, pierced by her \
yearning still. Nor tender willows, nor dew-quickened grass, Nor the loved \
streams that glide along low banks, Can lure her mind and turn the sudden \
pain; Nor other shapes of calves that graze thereby Distract her mind or \
lighten pain the least- So keen her search for something known and hers. \
Moreover, tender kids with bleating throats Do know their horned dams, and \
butting lambs The flocks of sheep, and thus they patter on, Unfailingly each \
to its proper teat, As nature intends. Lastly, with any grain, Thou'lt see \
that no one kernel in one kind Is so far like another, that there still Is \
not in shapes some difference running through. By a like law we see how earth \
is pied With shells and conchs, where, with soft waves, the sea Beats on the \
thirsty sands of curving shores. Wherefore again, again, since seeds of \
things Exist by nature, nor were wrought with hands After a fixed pattern of \
one other, They needs must flitter to and fro with shapes In types dissimilar \
to one another. Easy enough by thought of mind to solve Why fires of \
lightning more can penetrate Than these of ours from pitch-pine born on \
earth. For thou canst say lightning's celestial fire, So subtle, is formed of \
figures finer far, And passes thus through holes which this our fire, Born \
from the wood, created from the pine, Cannot. Again, light passes through the \
horn On the lantern's side, while rain is dashed away. And why?- unless those \
bodies of light should be Finer than those of water's genial showers. We see \
how quickly through a colander The wines will flow; how, on the other hand, \
The sluggish olive-oil delays: no doubt, Because 'tis wrought of elements \
more large, Or else more crook'd and intertangled. Thus It comes that the \
primordials cannot be So suddenly sundered one from other, and seep, One \
through each several hole of anything. And note, besides, that liquor of \
honey or milk Yields in the mouth agreeable taste to tongue, Whilst nauseous \
wormwood, pungent centaury, With their foul flavour set the lips awry; Thus \
simple 'tis to see that whatsoever Can touch the senses pleasingly are made \
Of smooth and rounded elements, whilst those Which seem the bitter and the \
sharp, are held Entwined by elements more crook'd, and so Are wont to tear \
their ways into our senses, And rend our body as they enter in. In short all \
good to sense, all bad to touch, Being up-built of figures so unlike, Are \
mutually at strife- lest thou suppose That the shrill rasping of a squeaking \
saw Consists of elements as smooth as song Which, waked by nimble fingers, on \
the strings The sweet musicians fashion; or suppose That same-shaped atoms \
through men's nostrils pierce When foul cadavers burn, as when the stage Is \
with Cilician saffron sprinkled fresh, And the altar near exhales Panchaean \
scent; Or hold as of like seed the goodly hues Of things which feast our \
eyes, as those which sting Against the smarting pupil and draw tears, Or \
show, with gruesome aspect, grim and vile. For never a shape which charms our \
sense was made Without some elemental smoothness; whilst Whate'er is harsh \
and irksome has been framed Still with some roughness in its elements. Some, \
too, there are which justly are supposed To be nor smooth nor altogether \
hooked, With bended barbs, but slightly angled-out, To tickle rather than to \
wound the sense- And of which sort is the salt tartar of wine And flavours of \
the gummed elecampane. Again, that glowing fire and icy rime Are fanged with \
teeth unlike whereby to sting Our body's sense, the touch of each gives \
proof. For touch- by sacred majesties of Gods!- Touch is indeed the body's \
only sense- Be't that something in-from-outward works, Be't that something in \
the body born Wounds, or delighteth as it passes out Along the procreant \
paths of Aphrodite; Or be't the seeds by some collision whirl Disordered in \
the body and confound By tumult and confusion all the sense- As thou mayst \
find, if haply with the hand Thyself thou strike thy body's any part. On \
which account, the elemental forms Must differ widely, as enabled thus To \
cause diverse sensations. And, again, What seems to us the hardened and \
condensed Must be of atoms among themselves more hooked, Be held compacted \
deep within, as 'twere By branch-like atoms- of which sort the chief Are \
diamond stones, despisers of all blows, And stalwart flint and strength of \
solid iron, And brazen bars, which, budging hard in locks, Do grate and \
scream. But what are liquid, formed Of fluid body, they indeed must be Of \
elements more smooth and round- because Their globules severally will not \
cohere: To suck the poppy-seeds from palm of hand Is quite as easy as \
drinking water down, And they, once struck, roll like unto the same. But that \
thou seest among the things that flow Some bitter, as the brine of ocean is, \
Is not the least a marvel... For since 'tis fluid, smooth its atoms are And \
round, with painful rough ones mixed therein; Yet need not these be held \
together hooked: In fact, though rough, they're globular besides, Able at \
once to roll, and rasp the sense. And that the more thou mayst believe me \
here, That with smooth elements are mixed the rough (Whence Neptune's salt \
astringent body comes), There is a means to separate the twain, And thereupon \
dividedly to see How the sweet water, after filtering through So often \
underground, flows freshened forth Into some hollow; for it leaves above The \
primal germs of nauseating brine, Since cling the rough more readily in \
earth. Lastly, whatso thou markest to disperse Upon the instant- smoke, and \
cloud, and flame- Must not (even though not all of smooth and round) Be yet \
co-linked with atoms intertwined, That thus they can, without together \
cleaving, So pierce our body and so bore the rocks. Whatever we see... Given \
to senses, that thou must perceive They're not from linked but pointed \
elements. The which now having taught, I will go on To bind thereto a fact to \
this allied And drawing from this its proof: these primal germs Vary, yet \
only with finite tale of shapes. For were these shapes quite infinite, some \
seeds Would have a body of infinite increase. For in one seed, in one small \
frame of any, The shapes can't vary from one another much. Assume, we'll say, \
that of three minim parts Consist the primal bodies, or add a few: When, now, \
by placing all these parts of one At top and bottom, changing lefts and \
rights, Thou hast with every kind of shift found out What the aspect of shape \
of its whole body Each new arrangement gives, for what remains, If thou \
percase wouldst vary its old shapes, New parts must then be added; follows \
next, If thou percase wouldst vary still its shapes, That by like logic each \
arrangement still Requires its increment of other parts. Ergo, an \
augmentation of its frame Follows upon each novelty of forms. Wherefore, it \
cannot be thou'lt undertake That seeds have infinite differences in form, \
Lest thus thou forcest some indeed to be Of an immeasurable immensity- Which \
I have taught above cannot be proved. And now for thee barbaric robes, and \
gleam Of Meliboean purple, touched with dye Of the Thessalian shell... The \
peacock's golden generations, stained With spotted gaieties, would lie \
o'erthrown By some new colour of new things more bright; The odour of myrrh \
and savours of honey despised; The swan's old lyric, and Apollo's hymns, Once \
modulated on the many chords, Would likewise sink o'ermastered and be mute: \
For, lo, a somewhat, finer than the rest, Would be arising evermore. So, too, \
Into some baser part might all retire, Even as we said to better might they \
come: For, lo, a somewhat, loathlier than the rest To nostrils, ears, and \
eyes, and taste of tongue, Would then, by reasoning reversed, be there. Since \
'tis not so, but unto things are given Their fixed limitations which do bound \
Their sum on either side, 'tmust be confessed That matter, too, by finite \
tale of shapes Does differ. Again, from earth's midsummer heats Unto the icy \
hoar-frosts of the year The forward path is fixed, and by like law \
O'ertravelled backwards at the dawn of spring. For each degree of hot, and \
each of cold, And the half-warm, all filling up the sum In due progression, \
lie, my Memmius, there Betwixt the two extremes: the things create Must \
differ, therefore, by a finite change, Since at each end marked off they ever \
are By fixed point- on one side plagued by flames And on the other by \
congealing frosts. The which now having taught, I will go on To bind thereto \
a fact to this allied And drawing from this its proof: those primal germs \
Which have been fashioned all of one like shape Are infinite in tale; for, \
since the forms Themselves are finite in divergences, Then those which are \
alike will have to be Infinite, else the sum of stuff remains A finite- what \
I've proved is not the fact, Showing in verse how corpuscles of stuff, From \
everlasting and to-day the same, Uphold the sum of things, all sides around \
By old succession of unending blows. For though thou view'st some beasts to \
be more rare, And mark'st in them a less prolific stock, Yet in another \
region, in lands remote, That kind abounding may make up the count; Even as \
we mark among the four-foot kind Snake-handed elephants, whose thousands wall \
With ivory ramparts India about, That her interiors cannot entered be- So big \
her count of brutes of which we see Such few examples. Or suppose, besides, \
We feign some thing, one of its kind and sole With body born, to which is \
nothing like In all the lands: yet now unless shall be An infinite count of \
matter out of which Thus to conceive and bring it forth to life, It cannot be \
created and- what's more- It cannot take its food and get increase. Yea, if \
through all the world in finite tale Be tossed the procreant bodies of one \
thing, Whence, then, and where in what mode, by what power, Shall they to \
meeting come together there, In such vast ocean of matter and tumult \
strange?- No means they have of joining into one. But, just as, after mighty \
ship-wrecks piled, The mighty main is wont to scatter wide The rowers' banks, \
the ribs, the yards, the prow, The masts and swimming oars, so that afar \
Along all shores of lands are seen afloat The carven fragments of the rended \
poop, Giving a lesson to mortality To shun the ambush of the faithless main, \
The violence and the guile, and trust it not At any hour, however much may \
smile The crafty enticements of the placid deep: Exactly thus, if once thou \
holdest true That certain seeds are finite in their tale, The various tides \
of matter, then, must needs Scatter them flung throughout the ages all, So \
that not ever can they join, as driven Together into union, nor remain In \
union, nor with increment can grow- But facts in proof are manifest for each: \
Things can be both begotten and increase. 'Tis therefore manifest that primal \
germs, Are infinite in any class thou wilt- From whence is furnished matter \
for all things. Nor can those motions that bring death prevail Forever, nor \
eternally entomb The welfare of the world; nor, further, can Those motions \
that give birth to things and growth Keep them forever when created there. \
Thus the long war, from everlasting waged, With equal strife among the \
elements Goes on and on. Now here, now there, prevail The vital forces of the \
world- or fall. Mixed with the funeral is the wildered wail Of infants coming \
to the shores of light: No night a day, no dawn a night hath followed That \
heard not, mingling with the small birth-cries, The wild laments, companions \
old of death And the black rites. This, too, in these affairs 'Tis fit thou \
hold well sealed, and keep consigned With no forgetting brain: nothing there \
is Whose nature is apparent out of hand That of one kind of elements \
consists- Nothing there is that's not of mixed seed. And whatsoe'er possesses \
in itself More largely many powers and properties Shows thus that here within \
itself there are The largest number of kinds and differing shapes Of \
elements. And, chief of all, the earth Hath in herself first bodies whence \
the springs, Rolling chill waters, renew forevermore The unmeasured main; \
hath whence the fires arise- For burns in many a spot her flamed crust, \
Whilst the impetuous Aetna raves indeed From more profounder fires- and she, \
again, Hath in herself the seed whence she can raise The shining grains and \
gladsome trees for men; Whence, also, rivers, fronds, and gladsome pastures \
Can she supply for mountain-roaming beasts. Wherefore great mother of gods, \
and mother of beasts, And parent of man hath she alone been named. Her hymned \
the old and learned bards of Greece Seated in chariot o'er the realms of air \
To drive her team of lions, teaching thus That the great earth hangs poised \
and cannot lie Resting on other earth. Unto her car They've yoked the wild \
beasts, since a progeny, However savage, must be tamed and chid By care of \
parents. They have girt about With turret-crown the summit of her head, \
Since, fortressed in her goodly strongholds high, 'Tis she sustains the \
cities; now, adorned With that same token, to-day is carried forth, With \
solemn awe through many a mighty land, The image of that mother, the divine. \
Her the wide nations, after antique rite, Do name Idaean Mother, giving her \
Escort of Phrygian bands, since first, they say, From out those regions 'twas \
that grain began Through all the world. To her do they assign The Galli, the \
emasculate, since thus They wish to show that men who violate The majesty of \
the mother and have proved Ingrate to parents are to be adjudged Unfit to \
give unto the shores of light A living progeny. The Galli come: And hollow \
cymbals, tight-skinned tambourines Resound around to bangings of their hands; \
The fierce horns threaten with a raucous bray; The tubed pipe excites their \
maddened minds In Phrygian measures; they bear before them knives, Wild \
emblems of their frenzy, which have power The rabble's ingrate heads and \
impious hearts To panic with terror of the goddess' might. And so, when \
through the mighty cities borne, She blesses man with salutations mute, They \
strew the highway of her journeyings With coin of brass and silver, gifting \
her With alms and largesse, and shower her and shade With flowers of roses \
falling like the snow Upon the Mother and her companion-bands. Here is an \
armed troop, the which by Greeks Are called the Phrygian Curetes. Since Haply \
among themselves they use to play In games of arms and leap in measure round \
With bloody mirth and by their nodding shake The terrorizing crests upon \
their heads, This is the armed troop that represents The arm'd Dictaean \
Curetes, who, in Crete, As runs the story, whilom did out-drown That infant \
cry of Zeus, what time their band, Young boys, in a swift dance around the \
boy, To measured step beat with the brass on brass, That Saturn might not get \
him for his jaws, And give its mother an eternal wound Along her heart. And \
'tis on this account That armed they escort the mighty Mother, Or else \
because they signify by this That she, the goddess, teaches men to be Eager \
with armed valour to defend Their motherland, and ready to stand forth, The \
guard and glory of their parents' years. A tale, however beautifully wrought, \
That's wide of reason by a long remove: For all the gods must of themselves \
enjoy Immortal aeons and supreme repose, Withdrawn from our affairs, \
detached, afar: Immune from peril and immune from pain, Themselves abounding \
in riches of their own, Needing not us, they are not touched by wrath They \
are not taken by service or by gift. Truly is earth insensate for all time; \
But, by obtaining germs of many things, In many a way she brings the many \
forth Into the light of sun. And here, whoso Decides to call the ocean \
Neptune, or The grain-crop Ceres, and prefers to abuse The name of Bacchus \
rather than pronounce The liquor's proper designation, him Let us permit to \
go on calling earth Mother of Gods, if only he will spare To taint his soul \
with foul religion. So, too, the wooly flocks, and horned kine, And brood of \
battle-eager horses, grazing Often together along one grassy plain, Under the \
cope of one blue sky, and slaking From out one stream of water each its \
thirst, All live their lives with face and form unlike, Keeping the parents' \
nature, parents' habits, Which, kind by kind, through ages they repeat. So \
great in any sort of herb thou wilt, So great again in any river of earth Are \
the distinct diversities of matter. Hence, further, every creature- any one \
From out them all- compounded is the same Of bones, blood, veins, heat, \
moisture, flesh, and thews- All differing vastly in their forms, and built Of \
elements dissimilar in shape. Again, all things by fire consumed ablaze, \
Within their frame lay up, if naught besides, At least those atoms whence \
derives their power To throw forth fire and send out light from under, To \
shoot the sparks and scatter embers wide. If, with like reasoning of mind, \
all else Thou traverse through, thou wilt discover thus That in their frame \
the seeds of many things They hide, and divers shapes of seeds contain. \
Further, thou markest much, to which are given Along together colour and \
flavour and smell, Among which, chief, are most burnt offerings. Thus must \
they be of divers shapes composed. A smell of scorching enters in our frame \
Where the bright colour from the dye goes not; And colour in one way, flavour \
in quite another Works inward to our senses- so mayst see They differ too in \
elemental shapes. Thus unlike forms into one mass combine, And things exist \
by intermixed seed. But still 'tmust not be thought that in all ways All \
things can be conjoined; for then wouldst view Portents begot about thee \
every side: Hulks of mankind half brute astarting up, At times big branches \
sprouting from man's trunk, Limbs of a sea-beast to a land-beast knit, And \
nature along the all-producing earth Feeding those dire Chimaeras breathing \
flame From hideous jaws- Of which 'tis simple fact That none have been begot; \
because we see All are from fixed seed and fixed dam Engendered and so \
function as to keep Throughout their growth their own ancestral type. This \
happens surely by a fixed law: For from all food-stuff, when once eaten down, \
Go sundered atoms, suited to each creature, Throughout their bodies, and, \
conjoining there, Produce the proper motions; but we see How, contrariwise, \
nature upon the ground Throws off those foreign to their frame; and many With \
viewless bodies from their bodies fly, By blows impelled- those impotent to \
join To any part, or, when inside, to accord And to take on the vital motions \
there. But think not, haply, living forms alone Are bound by these laws: they \
distinguished all. For just as all things of creation are, In their whole \
nature, each to each unlike, So must their atoms be in shape unlike- Not \
since few only are fashioned of like form, But since they all, as general \
rule, are not The same as all. Nay, here in these our verses, Elements many, \
common to many words, Thou seest, though yet 'tis needful to confess The \
words and verses differ, each from each, Compounded out of different \
elements- Not since few only, as common letters, run Through all the words, \
or no two words are made, One and the other, from all like elements, But \
since they all, as general rule, are not The same as all. Thus, too, in other \
things, Whilst many germs common to many things There are, yet they, combined \
among themselves, Can form new wholes to others quite unlike. Thus fairly one \
may say that humankind, The grains, the gladsome trees, are all made up Of \
different atoms. Further, since the seeds Are different, difference must \
there also be In intervening spaces, thoroughfares, Connections, weights, \
blows, clashings, motions, all Which not alone distinguish living forms, But \
sunder earth's whole ocean from the lands, And hold all heaven from the lands \
away. ABSENCE OF SECONDARY QUALITIES Now come, this wisdom by my sweet toil \
sought Look thou perceive, lest haply thou shouldst guess That the white \
objects shining to thine eyes Are gendered of white atoms, or the black Of a \
black seed; or yet believe that aught That's steeped in any hue should take \
its dye From bits of matter tinct with hue the same. For matter's bodies own \
no hue the least- Or like to objects or, again, unlike. But, if percase it \
seem to thee that mind Itself can dart no influence of its own Into these \
bodies, wide thou wand'rest off. For since the blind-born, who have ne'er \
surveyed The light of sun, yet recognise by touch Things that from birth had \
ne'er a hue for them, 'Tis thine to know that bodies can be brought No less \
unto the ken of our minds too, Though yet those bodies with no dye be \
smeared. Again, ourselves whatever in the dark We touch, the same we do not \
find to be Tinctured with any colour. Now that here I win the argument, I \
next will teach Now, every colour changes, none except, And every... Which \
the primordials ought nowise to do. Since an immutable somewhat must remain, \
Lest all things utterly be brought to naught. For change of anything from out \
its bounds Means instant death of that which was before. Wherefore be mindful \
not to stain with colour The seeds of things, lest things return for thee All \
utterly to naught. But now, if seeds Receive no property of colour, and yet \
Be still endowed with variable forms From which all kinds of colours they \
beget And vary (by reason that ever it matters much With what seeds, and in \
what positions joined, And what the motions that they give and get), \
Forthwith most easily thou mayst devise Why what was black of hue an hour ago \
Can of a sudden like the marble gleam,- As ocean, when the high winds have \
upheaved Its level plains, is changed to hoary waves Of marble whiteness: \
for, thou mayst declare, That, when the thing we often see as black Is in its \
matter then commixed anew, Some atoms rearranged, and some withdrawn, And \
added some, 'tis seen forthwith to turn Glowing and white. But if of azure \
seeds Consist the level waters of the deep, They could in nowise whiten: for \
however Thou shakest azure seeds, the same can never Pass into marble hue. \
But, if the seeds- Which thus produce the ocean's one pure sheen- Be now with \
one hue, now another dyed, As oft from alien forms and divers shapes A cube's \
produced all uniform in shape, 'Twould be but natural, even as in the cube We \
see the forms to be dissimilar, That thus we'd see in brightness of the deep \
(Or in whatever one pure sheen thou wilt) Colours diverse and all dissimilar. \
Besides, the unlike shapes don't thwart the least The whole in being \
externally a cube; But differing hues of things do block and keep The whole \
from being of one resultant hue. Then, too, the reason which entices us At \
times to attribute colours to the seeds Falls quite to pieces, since white \
things are not Create from white things, nor are black from black, But \
evermore they are create from things Of divers colours. Verily, the white \
Will rise more readily, is sooner born Out of no colour, than of black or \
aught Which stands in hostile opposition thus. Besides, since colours cannot \
be, sans light, And the primordials come not forth to light, 'Tis thine to \
know they are not clothed with colour- Truly, what kind of colour could there \
be In the viewless dark? Nay, in the light itself A colour changes, gleaming \
variedly, When smote by vertical or slanting ray. Thus in the sunlight shows \
the down of doves That circles, garlanding, the nape and throat: Now it is \
ruddy with a bright gold-bronze, Now, by a strange sensation it becomes \
Green-emerald blended with the coral-red. The peacock's tail, filled with the \
copious light, Changes its colours likewise, when it turns. Wherefore, since \
by some blow of light begot, Without such blow these colours can't become. \
And since the pupil of the eye receives Within itself one kind of blow, when \
said To feel a white hue, then another kind, When feeling a black or any \
other hue, And since it matters nothing with what hue The things thou \
touchest be perchance endowed, But rather with what sort of shape equipped, \
'Tis thine to know the atoms need not colour, But render forth sensations, as \
of touch, That vary with their varied forms. Besides, Since special shapes \
have not a special colour, And all formations of the primal germs Can be of \
any sheen thou wilt, why, then, Are not those objects which are of them made \
Suffused, each kind with colours of every kind? For then 'twere meet that \
ravens, as they fly, Should dartle from white pinions a white sheen, Or swans \
turn black from seed of black, or be Of any single varied dye thou wilt. \
Again, the more an object's rent to bits, The more thou see its colour fade \
away Little by little till 'tis quite extinct; As happens when the gaudy \
linen's picked Shred after shred away: the purple there, Phoenician red, most \
brilliant of all dyes, Is lost asunder, ravelled thread by thread; Hence \
canst perceive the fragments die away From out their colour, long ere they \
depart Back to the old primordials of things. And, last, since thou concedest \
not all bodies Send out a voice or smell, it happens thus That not to all \
thou givest sounds and smells. So, too, since we behold not all with eyes, \
'Tis thine to know some things there are as much Orphaned of colour, as \
others without smell, And reft of sound; and those the mind alert No less can \
apprehend than it can mark The things that lack some other qualities. But \
think not haply that the primal bodies Remain despoiled alone of colour: so, \
Are they from warmth dissevered and from cold And from hot exhalations; and \
they move, Both sterile of sound and dry of juice; and throw Not any odour \
from their proper bodies. Just as, when undertaking to prepare A liquid balm \
of myrrh and marjoram, And flower of nard, which to our nostrils breathes \
Odour of nectar, first of all behooves Thou seek, as far as find thou may and \
can, The inodorous olive-oil (which never sends One whiff of scent to \
nostrils), that it may The least debauch and ruin with sharp tang The odorous \
essence with its body mixed And in it seethed. And on the same account The \
primal germs of things must not be thought To furnish colour in begetting \
things, Nor sound, since pow'rless they to send forth aught From out \
themselves, nor any flavour, too, Nor cold, nor exhalation hot or warm. The \
rest; yet since these things are mortal all- The pliant mortal, with a body \
soft; The brittle mortal, with a crumbling frame; The hollow with a \
porous-all must be Disjoined from the primal elements, If still we wish under \
the world to lay Immortal ground-works, whereupon may rest The sum of weal \
and safety, lest for thee All things return to nothing utterly. Now, too: \
whate'er we see possessing sense Must yet confessedly be stablished all From \
elements insensate. And those signs, So clear to all and witnessed out of \
hand, Do not refute this dictum nor oppose; But rather themselves do lead us \
by the hand, Compelling belief that living things are born Of elements \
insensate, as I say. Sooth, we may see from out the stinking dung Live worms \
spring up, when, after soaking rains, The drenched earth rots; and all things \
change the same: Lo, change the rivers, the fronds, the gladsome pastures \
Into the cattle, the cattle their nature change Into our bodies, and from our \
body, oft Grow strong the powers and bodies of wild beasts And mighty-winged \
birds. Thus nature changes All foods to living frames, and procreates From \
them the senses of live creatures all, In manner about as she uncoils in \
flames Dry logs of wood and turns them all to fire. And seest not, therefore, \
how it matters much After what order are set the primal germs, And with what \
other germs they all are mixed, And what the motions that they give and get? \
But now, what is't that strikes thy sceptic mind, Constraining thee to sundry \
arguments Against belief that from insensate germs The sensible is gendered?- \
Verily, 'Tis this: that liquids, earth, and wood, though mixed, Are yet \
unable to gender vital sense. And, therefore, 'twill be well in these affairs \
This to remember: that I have not said Senses are born, under conditions all, \
From all things absolutely which create Objects that feel; but much it \
matters here Firstly, how small the seeds which thus compose The feeling \
thing, then, with what shapes endowed, And lastly what they in positions be, \
In motions, in arrangements. Of which facts Naught we perceive in logs of \
wood and clods; And yet even these, when sodden by the rains, Give birth to \
wormy grubs, because the bodies Of matter, from their old arrangements \
stirred By the new factor, then combine anew In such a way as genders living \
things. Next, they who deem that feeling objects can From feeling objects be \
create, and these, In turn, from others that are wont to feel When soft they \
make them; for all sense is linked With flesh, and thews, and veins- and \
such, we see, Are fashioned soft and of a mortal frame. Yet be't that these \
can last forever on: They'll have the sense that's proper to a part, Or else \
be judged to have a sense the same As that within live creatures as a whole. \
But of themselves those parts can never feel, For all the sense in every \
member back To something else refers- a severed hand, Or any other member of \
our frame, Itself alone cannot support sensation. It thus remains they must \
resemble, then, Live creatures as a whole, to have the power Of feeling \
sensation concordant in each part With the vital sense; and so they're bound \
to feel The things we feel exactly as do we. If such the case, how, then, can \
they be named The primal germs of things, and how avoid The highways of \
destruction?- since they be Mere living things and living things be all One \
and the same with mortal. Grant they could, Yet by their meetings and their \
unions all, Naught would result, indeed, besides a throng And hurly-burly all \
of living things- Precisely as men, and cattle, and wild beasts, By mere \
conglomeration each with each Can still beget not anything of new. But if by \
chance they lose, inside a body, Their own sense and another sense take on, \
What, then, avails it to assign them that Which is withdrawn thereafter? And \
besides, To touch on proof that we pronounced before, Just as we see the eggs \
of feathered fowls To change to living chicks, and swarming worms To bubble \
forth when from the soaking rains The earth is sodden, sure, sensations all \
Can out of non-sensations be begot. But if one say that sense can so far rise \
From non-sense by mutation, or because Brought forth as by a certain sort of \
birth, 'Twill serve to render plain to him and prove There is no birth, \
unless there be before Some formed union of the elements, Nor any change, \
unless they be unite. In first place, senses can't in body be Before its \
living nature's been begot,- Since all its stuff, in faith, is held dispersed \
About through rivers, air, and earth, and all That is from earth created, nor \
has met In combination, and, in proper mode, Conjoined into those vital \
motions which Kindle the all-perceiving senses- they That keep and guard each \
living thing soever. Again, a blow beyond its nature's strength Shatters \
forthwith each living thing soe'er, And on it goes confounding all the sense \
Of body and mind. For of the primal germs Are loosed their old arrangements, \
and, throughout, The vital motions blocked,- until the stuff, Shaken \
profoundly through the frame entire, Undoes the vital knots of soul from body \
And throws that soul, to outward wide-dispersed, Through all the pores. For \
what may we surmise A blow inflicted can achieve besides Shaking asunder and \
loosening all apart? It happens also, when less sharp the blow, The vital \
motions which are left are wont Oft to win out- win out, and stop and still \
The uncouth tumults gendered by the blow, And call each part to its own \
courses back, And shake away the motion of death which now Begins its own \
dominion in the body, And kindle anew the senses almost gone. For by what \
other means could they the more Collect their powers of thought and turn \
again From very doorways of destruction Back unto life, rather than pass \
whereto They be already well-nigh sped and so Pass quite away? Again, since \
pain is there Where bodies of matter, by some force stirred up, Through \
vitals and through joints, within their seats Quiver and quake inside, but \
soft delight, When they remove unto their place again: 'Tis thine to know the \
primal germs can be Assaulted by no pain, nor from themselves Take no \
delight; because indeed they are Not made of any bodies of first things, \
Under whose strange new motions they might ache Or pluck the fruit of any \
dear new sweet. And so they must be furnished with no sense. Once more, if \
thus, that every living thing May have sensation, needful 'tis to assign \
Sense also to its elements, what then Of those fixed elements from which \
mankind Hath been, by their peculiar virtue, formed? Of verity, they'll laugh \
aloud, like men, Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth, Or sprinkle with dewy \
tear-drops cheeks and chins, And have the cunning hardihood to say Much on \
the composition of the world, And in their turn inquire what elements They \
have themselves,- since, thus the same in kind As a whole mortal creature, \
even they Must also be from other elements, And then those others from others \
evermore- So that thou darest nowhere make a stop. Oho, I'll follow thee \
until thou grant The seed (which here thou say'st speaks, laughs, and thinks) \
Is yet derived out of other seeds Which in their turn are doing just the \
same. But if we see what raving nonsense this, And that a man may laugh, \
though not, forsooth, Compounded out of laughing elements, And think and \
utter reason with learn'd speech, Though not himself compounded, for a fact, \
Of sapient seeds and eloquent, why, then, Cannot those things which we \
perceive to have Their own sensation be composed as well Of intermixed seeds \
quite void of sense? INFINITE WORLDS Once more, we all from seed celestial \
spring, To all is that same father, from whom earth, The fostering mother, as \
she takes the drops Of liquid moisture, pregnant bears her broods- The \
shining grains, and gladsome shrubs and trees, And bears the human race and \
of the wild The generations all, the while she yields The foods wherewith all \
feed their frames and lead The genial life and propagate their kind; \
Wherefore she owneth that maternal name, By old desert. What was before from \
earth, The same in earth sinks back, and what was sent From shores of ether, \
that, returning home, The vaults of sky receive. Nor thus doth death So far \
annihilate things that she destroys The bodies of matter; but she dissipates \
Their combinations, and conjoins anew One element with others; and contrives \
That all things vary forms and change their colours And get sensations and \
straight give them o'er. And thus may'st know it matters with what others And \
in what structure the primordial germs Are held together, and what motions \
they Among themselves do give and get; nor think That aught we see hither and \
thither afloat Upon the crest of things, and now a birth And straightway now \
a ruin, inheres at rest Deep in the eternal atoms of the world. Why, even in \
these our very verses here It matters much with what and in what order Each \
element is set: the same denote Sky, and the ocean, lands, and streams, and \
sun; The same, the grains, and trees, and living things. And if not all \
alike, at least the most- But what distinctions by positions wrought! And \
thus no less in things themselves, when once Around are changed the intervals \
between, The paths of matter, its connections, weights, Blows, clashings, \
motions, order, structure, shapes, The things themselves must likewise \
changed be. Now to true reason give thy mind for us. Since here strange truth \
is putting forth its might To hit thee in thine ears, a new aspect Of things \
to show its front. Yet naught there is So easy that it standeth not at first \
More hard to credit than it after is; And naught soe'er that's great to such \
degree, Nor wonderful so far, but all mankind Little by little abandon their \
surprise. Look upward yonder at the bright clear sky And what it holds- the \
stars that wander o'er, The moon, the radiance of the splendour-sun: Yet all, \
if now they first for mortals were, If unforeseen now first asudden shown, \
What might there be more wonderful to tell, What that the nations would \
before have dared Less to believe might be?- I fancy, naught- So strange had \
been the marvel of that sight. The which o'erwearied to behold, to-day None \
deigns look upward to those lucent realms. Then, spew not reason from thy \
mind away, Beside thyself because the matter's new, But rather with keen \
judgment nicely weigh; And if to thee it then appeareth true, Render thy \
hands, or, if 'tis false at last, Gird thee to combat. For my mind-of-man Now \
seeks the nature of the vast Beyond There on the other side, that boundless \
sum Which lies without the ramparts of the world, Toward which the spirit \
longs to peer afar, Toward which indeed the swift elan of thought Flies \
unencumbered forth. Firstly, we find, Off to all regions round, on either \
side, Above, beneath, throughout the universe End is there none- as I have \
taught, as too The very thing of itself declares aloud, And as from nature of \
the unbottomed deep Shines clearly forth. Nor can we once suppose In any way \
'tis likely, (seeing that space To all sides stretches infinite and free, And \
seeds, innumerable in number, in sum Bottomless, there in many a manner fly, \
Bestirred in everlasting motion there), That only this one earth and sky of \
ours Hath been create and that those bodies of stuff, So many, perform no \
work outside the same; Seeing, moreover, this world too hath been By nature \
fashioned, even as seeds of things By innate motion chanced to clash and \
cling- After they'd been in many a manner driven Together at random, without \
design, in vain- And as at last those seeds together dwelt, Which, when \
together of a sudden thrown, Should alway furnish the commencements fit Of \
mighty things- the earth, the sea, the sky, And race of living creatures. \
Thus, I say, Again, again, 'tmust be confessed there are Such congregations \
of matter otherwhere, Like this our world which vasty ether holds In huge \
embrace. Besides, when matter abundant Is ready there, when space on hand, \
nor object Nor any cause retards, no marvel 'tis That things are carried on \
and made complete, Perforce. And now, if store of seeds there is So great \
that not whole life-times of the living Can count the tale... And if their \
force and nature abide the same, Able to throw the seeds of things together \
Into their places, even as here are thrown The seeds together in this world \
of ours, 'Tmust be confessed in other realms there are Still other worlds, \
still other breeds of men, And other generations of the wild. Hence too it \
happens in the sum there is No one thing single of its kind in birth, And \
single and sole in growth, but rather it is One member of some generated \
race, Among full many others of like kind. First, cast thy mind abroad upon \
the living: Thou'lt find the race of mountain-ranging wild Even thus to be, \
and thus the scions of men To be begot, and lastly the mute flocks Of scaled \
fish, and winged frames of birds. Wherefore confess we must on grounds the \
same That earth, sun, moon, and ocean, and all else, Exist not sole and \
single- rather in number Exceeding number. Since that deeply set Old boundary \
stone of life remains for them No less, and theirs a body of mortal birth No \
less, than every kind which here on earth Is so abundant in its members \
found. Which well perceived if thou hold in mind, Then Nature, delivered from \
every haughty lord, And forthwith free, is seen to do all things Herself and \
through herself of own accord, Rid of all gods. For- by their holy hearts \
Which pass in long tranquillity of peace Untroubled ages and a serene life!- \
Who hath the power (I ask), who hath the power To rule the sum of the \
immeasurable, To hold with steady hand the giant reins Of the unfathomed \
deep? Who hath the power At once to roll a multitude of skies, At once to \
heat with fires ethereal all The fruitful lands of multitudes of worlds, To \
be at all times in all places near, To stablish darkness by his clouds, to \
shake The serene spaces of the sky with sound, And hurl his lightnings,- ha, \
and whelm how oft In ruins his own temples, and to rave, Retiring to the \
wildernesses, there At practice with that thunderbolt of his, Which yet how \
often shoots the guilty by, And slays the honourable blameless ones! Ere \
since the birth-time of the world, ere since The risen first-born day of sea, \
earth, sun, Have many germs been added from outside, Have many seeds been \
added round about, Which the great All, the while it flung them on, Brought \
hither, that from them the sea and lands Could grow more big, and that the \
house of heaven Might get more room and raise its lofty roofs Far over earth, \
and air arise around. For bodies all, from out all regions, are Divided by \
blows, each to its proper thing, And all retire to their own proper kinds: \
The moist to moist retires; earth gets increase From earthy body; and fires, \
as on a forge, Beat out new fire; and ether forges ether; Till nature, author \
and ender of the world, Hath led all things to extreme bound of growth: As \
haps when that which hath been poured inside The vital veins of life is now \
no more Than that which ebbs within them and runs off. This is the point \
where life for each thing ends; This is the point where nature with her \
powers Curbs all increase. For whatsoe'er thou seest Grow big with glad \
increase, and step by step Climb upward to ripe age, these to themselves Take \
in more bodies than they send from selves, Whilst still the food is easily \
infused Through all the veins, and whilst the things are not So far expanded \
that they cast away Such numerous atoms as to cause a waste Greater than \
nutriment whereby they wax. For 'tmust be granted, truly, that from things \
Many a body ebbeth and runs off; But yet still more must come, until the \
things Have touched development's top pinnacle; Then old age breaks their \
powers and ripe strength And falls away into a worser part. For ever the \
ampler and more wide a thing, As soon as ever its augmentation ends, It \
scatters abroad forthwith to all sides round More bodies, sending them from \
out itself. Nor easily now is food disseminate Through all its veins; nor is \
that food enough To equal with a new supply on hand Those plenteous \
exhalations it gives off. Thus, fairly, all things perish, when with ebbing \
They're made less dense and when from blows without They are laid low; since \
food at last will fail Extremest eld, and bodies from outside Cease not with \
thumping to undo a thing And overmaster by infesting blows. Thus, too, the \
ramparts of the mighty world On all sides round shall taken be by storm, And \
tumble to wrack and shivered fragments down. For food it is must keep things \
whole, renewing; 'Tis food must prop and give support to all,- But to no \
purpose, since nor veins suffice To hold enough, nor nature ministers As much \
as needful. And even now 'tis thus: Its age is broken and the earth, outworn \
With many parturitions, scarce creates The little lives- she who created erst \
All generations and gave forth at birth Enormous bodies of wild beasts of \
old. For never, I fancy, did a golden cord From off the firmament above let \
down The mortal generations to the fields; Nor sea, nor breakers pounding on \
the rocks Created them; but earth it was who bore- The same to-day who feeds \
them from herself. Besides, herself of own accord, she first The shining \
grains and vineyards of all joy Created for mortality; herself Gave the sweet \
fruitage and the pastures glad, Which now to-day yet scarcely wax in size, \
Even when aided by our toiling arms. We break the ox, and wear away the \
strength Of sturdy farm-hands; iron tools to-day Barely avail for tilling of \
the fields, So niggardly they grudge our harvestings, So much increase our \
labour. Now to-day The aged ploughman, shaking of his head, Sighs o'er and \
o'er that labours of his hands Have fallen out in vain, and, as he thinks How \
present times are not as times of old, Often he praises the fortunes of his \
sire, And crackles, prating, how the ancient race, Fulfilled with piety, \
supported life With simple comfort in a narrow plot, Since, man for man, the \
measure of each field Was smaller far i' the old days. And, again, The gloomy \
planter of the withered vine Rails at the season's change and wearies heaven, \
Nor grasps that all of things by sure degrees Are wasting away and going to \
the tomb, Outworn by venerable length of life. BOOK III PROEM O thou who \
first uplifted in such dark So clear a torch aloft, who first shed light Upon \
the profitable ends of man, O thee I follow, glory of the Greeks, And set my \
footsteps squarely planted now Even in the impress and the marks of thine- \
Less like one eager to dispute the palm, More as one craving out of very love \
That I may copy thee!- for how should swallow Contend with swans or what \
compare could be In a race between young kids with tumbling legs And the \
strong might of the horse? Our father thou, And finder-out of truth, and thou \
to us Suppliest a father's precepts; and from out Those scriven leaves of \
thine, renowned soul (Like bees that sip of all in flowery wolds), We feed \
upon thy golden sayings all- Golden, and ever worthiest endless life. For \
soon as ever thy planning thought that sprang From god-like mind begins its \
loud proclaim Of nature's courses, terrors of the brain Asunder flee, the \
ramparts of the world Dispart away, and through the void entire I see the \
movements of the universe. Rises to vision the majesty of gods, And their \
abodes of everlasting calm Which neither wind may shake nor rain-cloud \
splash, Nor snow, congealed by sharp frosts, may harm With its white \
downfall: ever, unclouded sky O'er roofs, and laughs with far-diffused light. \
And nature gives to them their all, nor aught May ever pluck their peace of \
mind away. But nowhere to my vision rise no more The vaults of Acheron, \
though the broad earth Bars me no more from gazing down o'er all Which under \
our feet is going on below Along the void. O, here in these affairs Some new \
divine delight and trembling awe Takes hold through me, that thus by power of \
thine Nature, so plain and manifest at last, Hath been on every side laid \
bare to man! And since I've taught already of what sort The seeds of all \
things are, and how, distinct In divers forms, they flit of own accord, \
Stirred with a motion everlasting on, And in what mode things be from them \
create, Now, after such matters, should my verse, meseems, Make clear the \
nature of the mind and soul, And drive that dread of Acheron without, \
Headlong, which so confounds our human life Unto its deeps, pouring o'er all \
that is The black of death, nor leaves not anything To prosper- a liquid and \
unsullied joy. For as to what men sometimes will affirm: That more than \
Tartarus (the realm of death) They fear diseases and a life of shame, And \
know the substance of the soul is blood, Or rather wind (if haply thus their \
whim), And so need naught of this our science, then Thou well may'st note \
from what's to follow now That more for glory do they braggart forth Than for \
belief. For mark these very same: Exiles from country, fugitives afar From \
sight of men, with charges foul attaint, Abased with every wretchedness, they \
yet Live, and where'er the wretches come, they yet Make the ancestral \
sacrifices there, Butcher the black sheep, and to gods below Offer the \
honours, and in bitter case Turn much more keenly to religion. Wherefore, \
it's surer testing of a man In doubtful perils- mark him as he is Amid \
adversities; for then alone Are the true voices conjured from his breast, The \
mask off-stripped, reality behind. And greed, again, and the blind lust of \
honours Which force poor wretches past the bounds of law, And, oft allies and \
ministers of crime, To push through nights and days with hugest toil To rise \
untrammelled to the peaks of power- These wounds of life in no mean part are \
kept Festering and open by this fright of death. For ever we see fierce Want \
and foul Disgrace Dislodged afar from secure life and sweet, Like huddling \
Shapes before the doors of death. And whilst, from these, men wish to scape \
afar, Driven by false terror, and afar remove, With civic blood a fortune \
they amass, They double their riches, greedy, heapers-up Of corpse on corpse \
they have a cruel laugh For the sad burial of a brother-born, And hatred and \
fear of tables of their kin. Likewise, through this same terror, envy oft \
Makes them to peak because before their eyes That man is lordly, that man \
gazed upon Who walks begirt with honour glorious, Whilst they in filth and \
darkness roll around; Some perish away for statues and a name, And oft to \
that degree, from fright of death, Will hate of living and beholding light \
Take hold on humankind that they inflict Their own destruction with a gloomy \
heart- Forgetful that this fear is font of cares, This fear the plague upon \
their sense of shame, And this that breaks the ties of comradry And oversets \
all reverence and faith, Mid direst slaughter. For long ere to-day Often were \
traitors to country and dear parents Through quest to shun the realms of \
Acheron. For just as children tremble and fear all In the viewless dark, so \
even we at times Dread in the light so many things that be No whit more \
fearsome than what children feign, Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark. \
This terror, then, this darkness of the mind, Not sunrise with its flaring \
spokes of light, Nor glittering arrows of morning sun disperse, But only \
nature's aspect and her law. NATURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE MIND First, then, \
I say, the mind which oft we call The intellect, wherein is seated life's \
Counsel and regimen, is part no less Of man than hand and foot and eyes are \
parts Of one whole breathing creature. [But some hold] That sense of mind is \
in no fixed part seated, But is of body some one vital state,- Named \
\"harmony\" by Greeks, because thereby We live with sense, though intellect \
be not In any part: as oft the body is said To have good health (when health, \
however, 's not One part of him who has it), so they place The sense of mind \
in no fixed part of man. Mightily, diversly, meseems they err. Often the body \
palpable and seen Sickens, while yet in some invisible part We feel a \
pleasure; oft the other way, A miserable in mind feels pleasure still \
Throughout his body- quite the same as when A foot may pain without a pain in \
head. Besides, when these our limbs are given o'er To gentle sleep and lies \
the burdened frame At random void of sense, a something else Is yet within \
us, which upon that time Bestirs itself in many a wise, receiving All motions \
of joy and phantom cares of heart. Now, for to see that in man's members \
dwells Also the soul, and body ne'er is wont To feel sensation by a \"harmony\
\" Take this in chief: the fact that life remains Oft in our limbs, when much \
of body's gone; Yet that same life, when particles of heat, Though few, have \
scattered been, and through the mouth Air has been given forth abroad, \
forthwith Forever deserts the veins, and leaves the bones. Thus mayst thou \
know that not all particles Perform like parts, nor in like manner all Are \
props of weal and safety: rather those- The seeds of wind and exhalations \
warm- Take care that in our members life remains. Therefore a vital heat and \
wind there is Within the very body, which at death Deserts our frames. And \
so, since nature of mind And even of soul is found to be, as 'twere, A part \
of man, give over \"harmony\"- Name to musicians brought from Helicon,- \
Unless themselves they filched it otherwise, To serve for what was lacking \
name till then. Whate'er it be, they're welcome to it- thou, Hearken my other \
maxims. Mind and soul, I say, are held conjoined one with other, And form one \
single nature of themselves; But chief and regnant through the frame entire \
Is still that counsel which we call the mind, And that cleaves seated in the \
midmost breast. Here leap dismay and terror; round these haunts Be \
blandishments of joys; and therefore here The intellect, the mind. The rest \
of soul, Throughout the body scattered, but obeys- Moved by the nod and \
motion of the mind. This, for itself, sole through itself, hath thought; This \
for itself hath mirth, even when the thing That moves it, moves nor soul nor \
body at all. And as, when head or eye in us is smit By assailing pain, we are \
not tortured then Through all the body, so the mind alone Is sometimes \
smitten, or livens with a joy, Whilst yet the soul's remainder through the \
limbs And through the frame is stirred by nothing new. But when the mind is \
moved by shock more fierce, We mark the whole soul suffering all at once \
Along man's members: sweats and pallors spread Over the body, and the tongue \
is broken, And fails the voice away, and ring the ears, Mists blind the \
eyeballs, and the joints collapse,- Aye, men drop dead from terror of the \
mind. Hence, whoso will can readily remark That soul conjoined is with mind, \
and, when 'Tis strook by influence of the mind, forthwith In turn it hits and \
drives the body too. And this same argument establisheth That nature of mind \
and soul corporeal is: For when 'tis seen to drive the members on, To snatch \
from sleep the body, and to change The countenance, and the whole state of \
man To rule and turn,- what yet could never be Sans contact, and sans body \
contact fails- Must we not grant that mind and soul consist Of a corporeal \
nature?- And besides Thou markst that likewise with this body of ours Suffers \
the mind and with our body feels. If the dire speed of spear that cleaves the \
bones And bares the inner thews hits not the life, Yet follows a fainting and \
a foul collapse, And, on the ground, dazed tumult in the mind, And whiles a \
wavering will to rise afoot. So nature of mind must be corporeal, since From \
stroke and spear corporeal 'tis in throes. Now, of what body, what components \
formed Is this same mind I will go on to tell. First, I aver, 'tis superfine, \
composed Of tiniest particles- that such the fact Thou canst perceive, if \
thou attend, from this: Nothing is seen to happen with such speed As what the \
mind proposes and begins; Therefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly Than \
aught whose nature's palpable to eyes. But what's so agile must of seeds \
consist Most round, most tiny, that they may be moved, When hit by impulse \
slight. So water moves, In waves along, at impulse just the least- Being \
create of little shapes that roll; But, contrariwise, the quality of honey \
More stable is, its liquids more inert, More tardy its flow; for all its \
stock of matter Cleaves more together, since, indeed, 'tis made Of atoms not \
so smooth, so fine, and round. For the light breeze that hovers yet can blow \
High heaps of poppy-seed away for thee Downward from off the top; but, \
contrariwise, A pile of stones or spiny ears of wheat It can't at all. Thus, \
in so far as bodies Are small and smooth, is their mobility; But, \
contrariwise, the heavier and more rough, The more immovable they prove. Now, \
then, Since nature of mind is movable so much, Consist it must of seeds \
exceeding small And smooth and round. Which fact once known to thee, Good \
friend, will serve thee opportune in else. This also shows the nature of the \
same, How nice its texture, in how small a space 'Twould go, if once \
compacted as a pellet: When death's unvexed repose gets hold on man And mind \
and soul retire, thou markest there From the whole body nothing ta'en in \
form, Nothing in weight. Death grants ye everything, But vital sense and \
exhalation hot. Thus soul entire must be of smallmost seeds, Twined through \
the veins, the vitals, and the thews, Seeing that, when 'tis from whole body \
gone, The outward figuration of the limbs Is unimpaired and weight fails not \
a whit. Just so, when vanished the bouquet of wine, Or when an unguent's \
perfume delicate Into the winds away departs, or when From any body savour's \
gone, yet still The thing itself seems minished naught to eyes, Thereby, nor \
aught abstracted from its weight- No marvel, because seeds many and minute \
Produce the savours and the redolence In the whole body of the things. And \
so, Again, again, nature of mind and soul 'Tis thine to know created is of \
seeds The tiniest ever, since at flying-forth It beareth nothing of the \
weight away. Yet fancy not its nature simple so. For an impalpable aura, \
mixed with heat, Deserts the dying, and heat draws off the air; And heat \
there's none, unless commixed with air: For, since the nature of all heat is \
rare, Athrough it many seeds of air must move. Thus nature of mind is triple; \
yet those all Suffice not for creating sense- since mind Accepteth not that \
aught of these can cause Sense-bearing motions, and much less the thoughts A \
man revolves in mind. So unto these Must added be a somewhat, and a fourth; \
That somewhat's altogether void of name; Than which existeth naught more \
mobile, naught More an impalpable, of elements More small and smooth and \
round. That first transmits Sense-bearing motions through the frame, for that \
Is roused the first, composed of little shapes; Thence heat and viewless \
force of wind take up The motions, and thence air, and thence all things Are \
put in motion; the blood is strook, and then The vitals all begin to feel, \
and last To bones and marrow the sensation comes- Pleasure or torment. Nor \
will pain for naught Enter so far, nor a sharp ill seep through, But all \
things be perturbed to that degree That room for life will fail, and parts of \
soul Will scatter through the body's every pore. Yet as a rule, almost upon \
the skin These motion aIl are stopped, and this is why We have the power to \
retain our life. Now in my eagerness to tell thee how They are commixed, \
through what unions fit They function so, my country's pauper-speech \
Constrains me sadly. As I can, however, I'll touch some points and pass. In \
such a wise Course these primordials 'mongst one another With inter-motions \
that no one can be From other sundered, nor its agency Perform, if once \
divided by a space; Like many powers in one body they work. As in the flesh \
of any creature still Is odour and savour and a certain warmth, And yet from \
all of these one bulk of body Is made complete, so, viewless force of wind \
And warmth and air, commingled, do create One nature, by that mobile energy \
Assisted which from out itself to them Imparts initial motion, whereby first \
Sense-bearing motion along the vitals springs. For lurks this essence far and \
deep and under, Nor in our body is aught more shut from view, And 'tis the \
very soul of all the soul. And as within our members and whole frame The \
energy of mind and power of soul Is mixed and latent, since create it is Of \
bodies small and few, so lurks this fourth, This essence void of name, \
composed of small, And seems the very soul of all the soul, And holds \
dominion o'er the body all. And by like reason wind and air and heat Must \
function so, commingled through the frame, And now the one subside and now \
another In interchange of dominance, that thus From all of them one nature be \
produced, Lest heat and wind apart, and air apart, Make sense to perish, by \
disseverment. There is indeed in mind that heat it gets When seething in \
rage, and flashes from the eyes More swiftly fire; there is, again, that \
wind, Much, and so cold, companion of all dread, Which rouses the shudder in \
the shaken frame; There is no less that state of air composed, Making the \
tranquil breast, the serene face. But more of hot have they whose restive \
hearts, Whose minds of passion quickly seethe in rage- Of which kind chief \
are fierce abounding lions, Who often with roaring burst the breast \
o'erwrought, Unable to hold the surging wrath within; But the cold mind of \
stags has more of wind, And speedier through their inwards rouses up The icy \
currents which make their members quake. But more the oxen live by tranquil \
air, Nor e'er doth smoky torch of wrath applied, O'erspreading with shadows \
of a darkling murk, Rouse them too far; nor will they stiffen stark, Pierced \
through by icy javelins of fear; But have their place half-way between the \
two- Stags and fierce lions. Thus the race of men: Though training make them \
equally refined, It leaves those pristine vestiges behind Of each mind's \
nature. Nor may we suppose Evil can e'er be rooted up so far That one man's \
not more given to fits of wrath, Another's not more quickly touched by fear, \
A third not more long-suffering than he should. And needs must differ in many \
things besides The varied natures and resulting habits Of humankind- of which \
not now can I Expound the hidden causes, nor find names Enough for all the \
divers shapes of those Primordials whence this variation springs. But this \
meseems I'm able to declare: Those vestiges of natures left behind Which \
reason cannot quite expel from us Are still so slight that naught prevents a \
man From living a life even worthy of the gods. So then this soul is kept by \
all the body, Itself the body's guard, and source of weal: For they with \
common roots cleave each to each, Nor can be torn asunder without death. Not \
easy 'tis from lumps of frankincense To tear their fragrance forth, without \
its nature Perishing likewise: so, not easy 'tis From all the body nature of \
mind and soul To draw away, without the whole dissolved. With seeds so \
intertwined even from birth, They're dowered conjointly with a partner-life; \
No energy of body or mind, apart, Each of itself without the other's power, \
Can have sensation; but our sense, enkindled Along the vitals, to flame is \
blown by both With mutual motions. Besides the body alone Is nor begot nor \
grows, nor after death Seen to endure. For not as water at times Gives off \
the alien heat, nor is thereby Itself destroyed, but unimpaired remains- Not \
thus, I say, can the deserted frame Bear the dissevering of its joined soul, \
But, rent and ruined, moulders all away. Thus the joint contact of the body \
and soul Learns from their earliest age the vital motions, Even when still \
buried in the mother's womb; So no dissevering can hap to them, Without their \
bane and ill. And thence mayst see That, as conjoined is their source of \
weal, Conjoined also must their nature be. If one, moreover, denies that body \
feel, And holds that soul, through all the body mixed, Takes on this motion \
which we title \"sense,\" He battles in vain indubitable facts: For who'll \
explain what body's feeling is, Except by what the public fact itself Has \
given and taught us? \"But when soul is parted, Body's without all sense.\" \
True!- loses what Was even in its life-time not its own; And much beside it \
loses, when soul's driven Forth from that life-time. Or, to say that eyes \
Themselves can see no thing, but through the same The mind looks forth, as \
out of opened doors, Is- a hard saying; since the feel in eyes Says the \
reverse. For this itself draws on And forces into the pupils of our eyes Our \
consciousness. And note the case when often We lack the power to see \
refulgent things, Because our eyes are hampered by their light- With a mere \
doorway this would happen not; For, since it is our very selves that see, No \
open portals undertake the toil. Besides, if eyes of ours but act as doors, \
Methinks that, were our sight removed, the mind Ought then still better to \
behold a thing- When even the door-posts have been cleared away. Herein in \
these affairs nowise take up What honoured sage, Democritus, lays down- That \
proposition, that primordials Of body and mind, each super-posed on each, \
Vary alternately and interweave The fabric of our members. For not only Are \
the soul-elements smaller far than those Which this our body and inward parts \
compose, But also are they in their number less, And scattered sparsely \
through our frame. And thus This canst thou guarantee: soul's primal germs \
Maintain between them intervals as large At least as are the smallest bodies, \
which, When thrown against us, in our body rouse Sense-bearing motions. Hence \
it comes that we Sometimes don't feel alighting on our frames The clinging \
dust, or chalk that settles soft; Nor mists of night, nor spider's gossamer \
We feel against us, when, upon our road, Its net entangles us, nor on our \
head The dropping of its withered garmentings; Nor bird-feathers, nor \
vegetable down, Flying about, so light they barely fall; Nor feel the steps \
of every crawling thing, Nor each of all those footprints on our skin Of \
midges and the like. To that degree Must many primal germs be stirred in us \
Ere once the seeds of soul that through our frame Are intermingled 'gin to \
feel that those Primordials of the body have been strook, And ere, in \
pounding with such gaps between, They clash, combine and leap apart in turn. \
But mind is more the keeper of the gates, Hath more dominion over life than \
soul. For without intellect and mind there's not One part of soul can rest \
within our frame Least part of time; companioning, it goes With mind into the \
winds away, and leaves The icy members in the cold of death. But he whose \
mind and intellect abide Himself abides in life. However much The trunk be \
mangled, with the limbs lopped off, The soul withdrawn and taken from the \
limbs, Still lives the trunk and draws the vital air. Even when deprived of \
all but all the soul, Yet will it linger on and cleave to life,- Just as the \
power of vision still is strong, If but the pupil shall abide unharmed, Even \
when the eye around it's sorely rent- Provided only thou destroyest not \
Wholly the ball, but, cutting round the pupil, Leavest that pupil by itself \
behind- For more would ruin sight. But if that centre, That tiny part of eye, \
be eaten through, Forthwith the vision fails and darkness comes, Though in \
all else the unblemished ball be clear. 'Tis by like compact that the soul \
and mind Are each to other bound forevermore. THE SOUL IS MORTAL Now come: \
that thou mayst able be to know That minds and the light souls of all that \
live Have mortal birth and death, I will go on Verses to build meet for thy \
rule of life, Sought after long, discovered with sweet toil. But under one \
name I'd have thee yoke them both; And when, for instance, I shall speak of \
soul, Teaching the same to be but mortal, think Thereby I'm speaking also of \
the mind- Since both are one, a substance inter-joined. First, then, since I \
have taught how soul exists A subtle fabric, of particles minute, Made up \
from atoms smaller much than those Of water's liquid damp, or fog, or smoke, \
So in mobility it far excels, More prone to move, though strook by lighter \
cause Even moved by images of smoke or fog- As where we view, when in our \
sleeps we're lulled, The altars exhaling steam and smoke aloft- For, beyond \
doubt, these apparitions come To us from outward. Now, then, since thou \
seest, Their liquids depart, their waters flow away, When jars are shivered, \
and since fog and smoke Depart into the winds away, believe The soul no less \
is shed abroad and dies More quickly far, more quickly is dissolved Back to \
its primal bodies, when withdrawn From out man's members it has gone away. \
For, sure, if body (container of the same Like as a jar), when shivered from \
some cause, And rarefied by loss of blood from veins, Cannot for longer hold \
the soul, how then Thinkst thou it can be held by any air- A stuff much rarer \
than our bodies be? Besides we feel that mind to being comes Along with body, \
with body grows and ages. For just as children totter round about With frames \
infirm and tender, so there follows A weakling wisdom in their minds; and \
then, Where years have ripened into robust powers, Counsel is also greater, \
more increased The power of mind; thereafter, where already The body's \
shattered by master-powers of eld, And fallen the frame with its enfeebled \
powers, Thought hobbles, tongue wanders, and the mind gives way; All fails, \
all's lacking at the selfsame time. Therefore it suits that even the soul's \
dissolved, Like smoke, into the lofty winds of air; Since we behold the same \
to being come Along with body and grow, and, as I've taught, Crumble and \
crack, therewith outworn by eld. Then, too, we see, that, just as body takes \
Monstrous diseases and the dreadful pain, So mind its bitter cares, the \
grief, the fear; Wherefore it tallies that the mind no less Partaker is of \
death; for pain and disease Are both artificers of death,- as well We've \
learned by the passing of many a man ere now. Nay, too, in diseases of body, \
often the mind Wanders afield; for 'tis beside itself, And crazed it speaks, \
or many a time it sinks, With eyelids closing and a drooping nod, In heavy \
drowse, on to eternal sleep; From whence nor hears it any voices more, Nor \
able is to know the faces here Of those about him standing with wet cheeks \
Who vainly call him back to light and life. Wherefore mind too, confess we \
must, dissolves, Seeing, indeed, contagions of disease Enter into the same. \
Again, O why, When the strong wine has entered into man, And its diffused \
fire gone round the veins, Why follows then a heaviness of limbs, A tangle of \
the legs as round he reels, A stuttering tongue, an intellect besoaked, Eyes \
all aswim, and hiccups, shouts, and brawls, And whatso else is of that ilk?- \
Why this?- If not that violent and impetuous wine Is wont to confound the \
soul within the body? But whatso can confounded be and balked, Gives proof, \
that if a hardier cause got in, 'Twould hap that it would perish then, \
bereaved Of any life thereafter. And, moreover, Often will some one in a \
sudden fit, As if by stroke of lightning, tumble down Before our eyes, and \
sputter foam, and grunt, Blither, and twist about with sinews taut, Gasp up \
in starts, and weary out his limbs With tossing round. No marvel, since \
distract Through frame by violence of disease. Confounds, he foams, as if to \
vomit soul, As on the salt sea boil the billows round Under the master might \
of winds. And now A groan's forced out, because his limbs are griped, But, in \
the main, because the seeds of voice Are driven forth and carried in a mass \
Outwards by mouth, where they are wont to go, And have a builded highway. He \
becomes Mere fool, since energy of mind and soul Confounded is, and, as I've \
shown, to-riven, Asunder thrown, and torn to pieces all By the same venom. \
But, again, where cause Of that disease has faced about, and back Retreats \
sharp poison of corrupted frame Into its shadowy lairs, the man at first \
Arises reeling, and gradually comes back To all his senses and recovers soul. \
Thus, since within the body itself of man The mind and soul are by such great \
diseases Shaken, so miserably in labour distraught, Why, then, believe that \
in the open air, Without a body, they can pass their life, Immortal, battling \
with the master winds? And, since we mark the mind itself is cured, Like the \
sick body, and restored can be By medicine, this is forewarning too That \
mortal lives the mind. For proper it is That whosoe'er begins and undertakes \
To alter the mind, or meditates to change Any another nature soever, should \
add New parts, or readjust the order given, Or from the sum remove at least a \
bit. But what's immortal willeth for itself Its parts be nor increased, nor \
rearranged, Nor any bit soever flow away: For change of anything from out its \
bounds Means instant death of that which was before. Ergo, the mind, whether \
in sickness fallen, Or by the medicine restored, gives signs, As I have \
taught, of its mortality. So surely will a fact of truth make head 'Gainst \
errors' theories all, and so shut off All refuge from the adversary, and rout \
Error by two-edged confutation. And since the mind is of a man one part, \
Which in one fixed place remains, like ears, And eyes, and every sense which \
pilots life; And just as hand, or eye, or nose, apart, Severed from us, can \
neither feel nor be, But in the least of time is left to rot, Thus mind alone \
can never be, without The body and the man himself, which seems, As 'twere \
the vessel of the same- or aught Whate'er thou'lt feign as yet more closely \
joined: Since body cleaves to mind by surest bonds. Again, the body's and the \
mind's live powers Only in union prosper and enjoy; For neither can nature of \
mind, alone of self Sans body, give the vital motions forth; Nor, then, can \
body, wanting soul, endure And use the senses. Verily, as the eye, Alone, \
up-rended from its roots, apart From all the body, can peer about at naught, \
So soul and mind it seems are nothing able, When by themselves. No marvel, \
because, commixed Through veins and inwards, and through bones and thews, \
Their elements primordial are confined By all the body, and own no power free \
To bound around through interspaces big, Thus, shut within these confines, \
they take on Motions of sense, which, after death, thrown out Beyond the body \
to the winds of air, Take on they cannot- and on this account, Because no \
more in such a way confined. For air will be a body, be alive, If in that air \
the soul can keep itself, And in that air enclose those motions all Which in \
the thews and in the body itself A while ago 'twas making. So for this, \
Again, again, I say confess we must, That, when the body's wrappings are \
unwound, And when the vital breath is forced without, The soul, the senses of \
the mind dissolve,- Since for the twain the cause and ground of life Is in \
the fact of their conjoined estate. Once more, since body's unable to sustain \
Division from the soul, without decay And obscene stench, how canst thou \
doubt but that The soul, uprisen from the body's deeps, Has filtered away, \
wide-drifted like a smoke, Or that the changed body crumbling fell With ruin \
so entire, because, indeed, Its deep foundations have been moved from place, \
The soul out-filtering even through the frame, And through the body's every \
winding way And orifice? And so by many means Thou'rt free to learn that \
nature of the soul Hath passed in fragments out along the frame, And that \
'twas shivered in the very body Ere ever it slipped abroad and swam away Into \
the winds of air. For never a man Dying appears to feel the soul go forth As \
one sure whole from all his body at once, Nor first come up the throat and \
into mouth; But feels it failing in a certain spot, Even as he knows the \
senses too dissolve Each in its own location in the frame. But were this mind \
of ours immortal mind, Dying 'twould scarce bewail a dissolution, But rather \
the going, the leaving of its coat, Like to a snake. Wherefore, when once the \
body Hath passed away, admit we must that soul, Shivered in all that body, \
perished too. Nay, even when moving in the bounds of life, Often the soul, \
now tottering from some cause, Craves to go out, and from the frame entire \
Loosened to be; the countenance becomes Flaccid, as if the supreme hour were \
there; And flabbily collapse the members all Against the bloodless trunk- the \
kind of case We see when we remark in common phrase, \"That man's quite gone,\
\" or \"fainted dead away\"; And where there's now a bustle of alarm, And all \
are eager to get some hold upon The man's last link of life. For then the \
mind And all the power of soul are shook so sore, And these so totter along \
with all the frame, That any cause a little stronger might Dissolve them \
altogether.- Why, then, doubt That soul, when once without the body thrust, \
There in the open, an enfeebled thing, Its wrappings stripped away, cannot \
endure Not only through no everlasting age, But even, indeed, through not the \
least of time? Then, too, why never is the intellect, The counselling mind, \
begotten in the head, The feet, the hands, instead of cleaving still To one \
sole seat, to one fixed haunt, the breast, If not that fixed places be \
assigned For each thing's birth, where each, when 'tis create, Is able to \
endure, and that our frames Have such complex adjustments that no shift In \
order of our members may appear? To that degree effect succeeds to cause, Nor \
is the flame once wont to be create In flowing streams, nor cold begot in \
fire. Besides, if nature of soul immortal be, And able to feel, when from our \
frame disjoined, The same, I fancy, must be thought to be Endowed with senses \
five,- nor is there way But this whereby to image to ourselves How \
under-souls may roam in Acheron. Thus painters and the elder race of bards \
Have pictured souls with senses so endowed. But neither eyes, nor nose, nor \
hand, alone Apart from body can exist for soul, Nor tongue nor ears apart. \
And hence indeed Alone by self they can nor feel nor be. And since we mark \
the vital sense to be In the whole body, all one living thing, If of a sudden \
a force with rapid stroke Should slice it down the middle and cleave in \
twain, Beyond a doubt likewise the soul itself, Divided, dissevered, asunder \
will be flung Along with body. But what severed is And into sundry parts \
divides, indeed Admits it owns no everlasting nature. We hear how chariots of \
war, areek With hurly slaughter, lop with flashing scythes The limbs away so \
suddenly that there, Fallen from the trunk, they quiver on the earth, The \
while the mind and powers of the man Can feel no pain, for swiftness of his \
hurt, And sheer abandon in the zest of battle: With the remainder of his \
frame he seeks Anew the battle and the slaughter, nor marks How the swift \
wheels and scythes of ravin have dragged Off with the horses his left arm and \
shield; Nor other how his right has dropped away, Mounting again and on. A \
third attempts With leg dismembered to arise and stand, Whilst, on the ground \
hard by, the dying foot Twitches its spreading toes. And even the head, When \
from the warm and living trunk lopped off, Keeps on the ground the vital \
countenance And open eyes, until 't has rendered up All remnants of the soul. \
Nay, once again: If, when a serpent's darting forth its tongue, And lashing \
its tail, thou gettest chance to hew With axe its length of trunk to many \
parts, Thou'lt see each severed fragment writhing round With its fresh wound, \
and spattering up the sod, And there the fore-part seeking with the jaws \
After the hinder, with bite to stop the pain. So shall we say that these be \
souls entire In all those fractions?- but from that 'twould follow One \
creature'd have in body many souls. Therefore, the soul, which was indeed but \
one, Has been divided with the body too: Each is but mortal, since alike is \
each Hewn into many parts. Again, how often We view our fellow going by \
degrees, And losing limb by limb the vital sense; First nails and fingers of \
the feet turn blue, Next die the feet and legs, then o'er the rest Slow crawl \
the certain footsteps of cold death. And since this nature of the soul is \
torn, Nor mounts away, as at one time, entire, We needs must hold it mortal. \
But perchance If thou supposest that the soul itself Can inward draw along \
the frame, and bring Its parts together to one place, and so From all the \
members draw the sense away, Why, then, that place in which such stock of \
soul Collected is, should greater seem in sense. But since such place is \
nowhere, for a fact, As said before, 'tis rent and scattered forth, And so \
goes under. Or again, if now I please to grant the false, and say that soul \
Can thus be lumped within the frames of those Who leave the sunshine, dying \
bit by bit, Still must the soul as mortal be confessed; Nor aught it matters \
whether to wrack it go, Dispersed in the winds, or, gathered in a mass From \
all its parts, sink down to brutish death, Since more and more in every \
region sense Fails the whole man, and less and less of life In every region \
lingers. And besides, If soul immortal is, and winds its way Into the body at \
the birth of man, Why can we not remember something, then, Of life-time spent \
before? why keep we not Some footprints of the things we did of, old? But if \
so changed hath been the power of mind, That every recollection of things \
done Is fallen away, at no o'erlong remove Is that, I trow, from what we mean \
by death. Wherefore 'tis sure that what hath been before Hath died, and what \
now is is now create. Moreover, if after the body hath been built Our mind's \
live powers are wont to be put in, Just at the moment that we come to birth, \
And cross the sills of life, 'twould scarcely fit For them to live as if they \
seemed to grow Along with limbs and frame, even in the blood, But rather as \
in a cavern all alone. (Yet all the body duly throngs with sense.) But public \
fact declares against all this: For soul is so entwined through the veins, \
The flesh, the thews, the bones, that even the teeth Share in sensation, as \
proven by dull ache, By twinge from icy water, or grating crunch Upon a stone \
that got in mouth with bread. Wherefore, again, again, souls must be thought \
Nor void of birth, nor free from law of death; Nor, if, from outward, in they \
wound their way, Could they be thought as able so to cleave To these our \
frames, nor, since so interwove, Appears it that they're able to go forth \
Unhurt and whole and loose themselves unscathed From all the thews, \
articulations, bones. But, if perchance thou thinkest that the soul, From \
outward winding in its way, is wont To seep and soak along these members \
ours, Then all the more 'twill perish, being thus With body fused- for what \
will seep and soak Will be dissolved and will therefore die. For just as \
food, dispersed through all the pores Of body, and passed through limbs and \
all the frame, Perishes, supplying from itself the stuff For other nature, \
thus the soul and mind, Though whole and new into a body going, Are yet, by \
seeping in, dissolved away, Whilst, as through pores, to all the frame there \
pass Those particles from which created is This nature of mind, now ruler of \
our body, Born from that soul which perished, when divided Along the frame. \
Wherefore it seems that soul Hath both a natal and funeral hour. Besides are \
seeds of soul there left behind In the breathless body, or not? If there they \
are, It cannot justly be immortal deemed, Since, shorn of some parts lost, \
'thas gone away: But if, borne off with members uncorrupt, 'Thas fled so \
absolutely all away It leaves not one remainder of itself Behind in body, \
whence do cadavers, then, From out their putrid flesh exhale the worms, And \
whence does such a mass of living things, Boneless and bloodless, o'er the \
bloated frame Bubble and swarm? But if perchance thou thinkest That souls \
from outward into worms can wind, And each into a separate body come, And \
reckonest not why many thousand souls Collect where only one has gone away, \
Here is a point, in sooth, that seems to need Inquiry and a putting to the \
test: Whether the souls go on a hunt for seeds Of worms wherewith to build \
their dwelling places, Or enter bodies ready-made, as 'twere. But why \
themselves they thus should do and toil 'Tis hard to say, since, being free \
of body, They flit around, harassed by no disease, Nor cold nor famine; for \
the body labours By more of kinship to these flaws of life, And mind by \
contact with that body suffers So many ills. But grant it be for them However \
useful to construct a body To which to enter in, 'tis plain they can't. Then, \
souls for self no frames nor bodies make, Nor is there how they once might \
enter in To bodies ready-made- for they cannot Be nicely interwoven with the \
same, And there'll be formed no interplay of sense Common to each. Again, why \
is't there goes Impetuous rage with lion's breed morose, And cunning with \
foxes, and to deer why given The ancestral fear and tendency to flee, And why \
in short do all the rest of traits Engender from the very start of life In \
the members and mentality, if not Because one certain power of mind that came \
From its own seed and breed waxes the same Along with all the body? But were \
mind Immortal, were it wont to change its bodies, How topsy-turvy would \
earth's creatures act! The Hyrcan hound would flee the onset oft Of antlered \
stag, the scurrying hawk would quake Along the winds of air at the coming \
dove, And men would dote, and savage beasts be wise; For false the reasoning \
of those that say Immortal mind is changed by change of body- For what is \
changed dissolves, and therefore dies. For parts are re-disposed and leave \
their order; Wherefore they must be also capable Of dissolution through the \
frame at last, That they along with body perish all. But should some say that \
always souls of men Go into human bodies, I will ask: How can a wise become a \
dullard soul? And why is never a child's a prudent soul? And the mare's filly \
why not trained so well As sturdy strength of steed? We may be sure They'll \
take their refuge in the thought that mind Becomes a weakling in a weakling \
frame. Yet be this so, 'tis needful to confess The soul but mortal, since, so \
altered now Throughout the frame, it loses the life and sense It had before. \
Or how can mind wax strong Coequally with body and attain The craved flower \
of life, unless it be The body's colleague in its origins? Or what's the \
purport of its going forth From aged limbs?- fears it, perhaps, to stay, Pent \
in a crumbled body? Or lest its house, Outworn by venerable length of days, \
May topple down upon it? But indeed For an immortal perils are there none. \
Again, at parturitions of the wild And at the rites of Love, that souls \
should stand Ready hard by seems ludicrous enough- Immortals waiting for \
their mortal limbs In numbers innumerable, contending madly Which shall be \
first and chief to enter in!- Unless perchance among the souls there be Such \
treaties stablished that the first to come Flying along, shall enter in the \
first, And that they make no rivalries of strength! Again, in ether can't \
exist a tree, Nor clouds in ocean deeps, nor in the fields Can fishes live, \
nor blood in timber be, Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged Where \
everything may grow and have its place. Thus nature of mind cannot arise \
alone Without the body, nor exist afar From thews and blood. But if 'twere \
possible, Much rather might this very power of mind Be in the head, the \
shoulders or the heels, And, born in any part soever, yet In the same man, in \
the same vessel abide. But since within this body even of ours Stands fixed \
and appears arranged sure Where soul and mind can each exist and grow, Deny \
we must the more that they can have Duration and birth, wholly outside the \
frame. For, verily, the mortal to conjoin With the eternal, and to feign they \
feel Together, and can function each with each, Is but to dote: for what can \
be conceived Of more unlike, discrepant, ill-assorted, Than something mortal \
in a union joined With an immortal and a secular To bear the outrageous \
tempests? Then, again, Whatever abides eternal must indeed Either repel all \
strokes, because 'tis made Of solid body, and permit no entrance Of aught \
with power to sunder from within The parts compact- as are those seeds of \
stuff Whose nature we've exhibited before; Or else be able to endure through \
time For this: because they are from blows exempt, As is the void, the which \
abides untouched, Unsmit by any stroke; or else because There is no room \
around, whereto things can, As 'twere, depart in dissolution all,- Even as \
the sum of sums eternal is, Without or place beyond whereto things may \
Asunder fly, or bodies which can smite, And thus dissolve them by the blows \
of might. But if perchance the soul's to be adjudged Immortal, mainly on \
ground 'tis kept secure In vital forces- either because there come Never at \
all things hostile to its weal, Or else because what come somehow retire, \
Repelled or ere we feel the harm they work, For, lo, besides that, when the \
frame's diseased, Soul sickens too, there cometh, many a time, That which \
torments it with the things to be, Keeps it in dread, and wearies it with \
cares; And even when evil acts are of the past, Still gnaw the old \
transgressions bitterly. Add, too, that frenzy, peculiar to the mind, And \
that oblivion of the things that were; Add its submergence in the murky waves \
Of drowse and torpor. FOLLY OF THE FEAR OF DEATH Therefore death to us Is \
nothing, nor concerns us in the least, Since nature of mind is mortal \
evermore. And just as in the ages gone before We felt no touch of ill, when \
all sides round To battle came the Carthaginian host, And the times, shaken \
by tumultuous war, Under the aery coasts of arching heaven Shuddered and \
trembled, and all humankind Doubted to which the empery should fall By land \
and sea, thus when we are no more, When comes that sundering of our body and \
soul Through which we're fashioned to a single state, Verily naught to us, us \
then no more, Can come to pass, naught move our senses then- No, not if earth \
confounded were with sea, And sea with heaven. But if indeed do feel The \
nature of mind and energy of soul, After their severance from this body of \
ours, Yet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds And wedlock of the soul and \
body live, Through which we're fashioned to a single state. And, even if time \
collected after death The matter of our frames and set it all Again in place \
as now, and if again To us the light of life were given, O yet That process \
too would not concern us aught, When once the self-succession of our sense \
Has been asunder broken. And now and here, Little enough we're busied with \
the selves We were aforetime, nor, concerning them, Suffer a sore distress. \
For shouldst thou gaze Backwards across all yesterdays of time The \
immeasurable, thinking how manifold The motions of matter are, then couldst \
thou well Credit this too: often these very seeds (From which we are to-day) \
of old were set In the same order as they are to-day- Yet this we can't to \
consciousness recall Through the remembering mind. For there hath been An \
interposed pause of life, and wide Have all the motions wandered everywhere \
From these our senses. For if woe and ail Perchance are toward, then the man \
to whom The bane can happen must himself be there At that same time. But \
death precludeth this, Forbidding life to him on whom might crowd Such irk \
and care; and granted 'tis to know: Nothing for us there is to dread in \
death, No wretchedness for him who is no more, The same estate as if ne'er \
born before, When death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life. Hence, where \
thou seest a man to grieve because When dead he rots with body laid away, Or \
perishes in flames or jaws of beasts, Know well: he rings not true, and that \
beneath Still works an unseen sting upon his heart, However he deny that he \
believes. His shall be aught of feeling after death. For he, I fancy, grants \
not what he says, Nor what that presupposes, and he fails To pluck himself \
with all his roots from life And cast that self away, quite unawares Feigning \
that some remainder's left behind. For when in life one pictures to oneself \
His body dead by beasts and vultures torn, He pities his state, dividing not \
himself Therefrom, removing not the self enough From the body flung away, \
imagining Himself that body, and projecting there His own sense, as he stands \
beside it: hence He grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks That in true \
death there is no second self Alive and able to sorrow for self destroyed, Or \
stand lamenting that the self lies there Mangled or burning. For if it an \
evil is Dead to be jerked about by jaw and fang Of the wild brutes, I see not \
why 'twere not Bitter to lie on fires and roast in flames, Or suffocate in \
honey, and, reclined On the smooth oblong of an icy slab, Grow stiff in cold, \
or sink with load of earth Down-crushing from above. \"Thee now no more The \
joyful house and best of wives shall welcome, Nor little sons run up to \
snatch their kisses And touch with silent happiness thy heart. Thou shalt not \
speed in undertakings more, Nor be the warder of thine own no more. Poor \
wretch,\" they say, \"one hostile hour hath ta'en Wretchedly from thee all \
life's many guerdons,\" But add not, \"yet no longer unto thee Remains a \
remnant of desire for them\" If this they only well perceived with mind And \
followed up with maxims, they would free Their state of man from anguish and \
from fear. \"O even as here thou art, aslumber in death, So shalt thou \
slumber down the rest of time, Released from every harrying pang. But we, We \
have bewept thee with insatiate woe, Standing beside whilst on the awful pyre \
Thou wert made ashes; and no day shall take For us the eternal sorrow from \
the breast.\" But ask the mourner what's the bitterness That man should waste \
in an eternal grief, If, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest? For when \
the soul and frame together are sunk In slumber, no one then demands his self \
Or being. Well, this sleep may be forever, Without desire of any selfhood \
more, For all it matters unto us asleep. Yet not at all do those primordial \
germs Roam round our members, at that time, afar From their own motions that \
produce our senses- Since, when he's startled from his sleep, a man Collects \
his senses. Death is, then, to us Much less- if there can be a less than that \
Which is itself a nothing: for there comes Hard upon death a scattering more \
great Of the throng of matter, and no man wakes up On whom once falls the icy \
pause of life. This too, O often from the soul men say, Along their couches \
holding of the cups, With faces shaded by fresh wreaths awry: \"Brief is this \
fruit of joy to paltry man, Soon, soon departed, and thereafter, no, It may \
not be recalled.\"- As if, forsooth, It were their prime of evils in great \
death To parch, poor tongues, with thirst and arid drought, Or chafe for any \
lack. Once more, if Nature Should of a sudden send a voice abroad, And her \
own self inveigh against us so: \"Mortal, what hast thou of such grave \
concern That thou indulgest in too sickly plaints? Why this bemoaning and \
beweeping death? For if thy life aforetime and behind To thee was grateful, \
and not all thy good Was heaped as in sieve to flow away And perish \
unavailingly, why not, Even like a banqueter, depart the halls, Laden with \
life? why not with mind content Take now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest? \
But if whatever thou enjoyed hath been Lavished and lost, and life is now \
offence, Why seekest more to add- which in its turn Will perish foully and \
fall out in vain? O why not rather make an end of life, Of labour? For all I \
may devise or find To pleasure thee is nothing: all things are The same \
forever. Though not yet thy body Wrinkles with years, nor yet the frame \
exhausts Outworn, still things abide the same, even if Thou goest on to \
conquer all of time With length of days, yea, if thou never diest\"- What \
were our answer, but that Nature here Urges just suit and in her words lays \
down True cause of action? Yet should one complain, Riper in years and elder, \
and lament, Poor devil, his death more sorely than is fit, Then would she \
not, with greater right, on him Cry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill: \
\"Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon! Thou wrinklest- after \
thou hast had the sum Of the guerdons of life; yet, since thou cravest ever \
What's not at hand, contemning present good, That life has slipped away, \
unperfected And unavailing unto thee. And now, Or ere thou guessed it, death \
beside thy head Stands- and before thou canst be going home Sated and laden \
with the goodly feast. But now yield all that's alien to thine age,- Up, with \
good grace! make room for sons: thou must.\" Justly, I fancy, would she \
reason thus, Justly inveigh and gird: since ever the old Outcrowded by the \
new gives way, and ever The one thing from the others is repaired. Nor no man \
is consigned to the abyss Of Tartarus, the black. For stuff must be, That \
thus the after-generations grow,- Though these, their life completed, follow \
thee; And thus like thee are generations all- Already fallen, or some time to \
fall. So one thing from another rises ever; And in fee-simple life is given \
to none, But unto all mere usufruct. Look back: Nothing to us was all \
fore-passed eld Of time the eternal, ere we had a birth. And Nature holds \
this like a mirror up Of time-to-be when we are dead and gone. And what is \
there so horrible appears? Now what is there so sad about it all? Is't not \
serener far than any sleep? And, verily, those tortures said to be In \
Acheron, the deep, they all are ours Here in this life. No Tantalus, benumbed \
With baseless terror, as the fables tell, Fears the huge boulder hanging in \
the air: But, rather, in life an empty dread of Gods Urges mortality, and \
each one fears Such fall of fortune as may chance to him. Nor eat the \
vultures into Tityus Prostrate in Acheron, nor can they find, Forsooth, \
throughout eternal ages, aught To pry around for in that mighty breast. \
However hugely he extend his bulk- Who hath for outspread limbs not acres \
nine, But the whole earth- he shall not able be To bear eternal pain nor \
furnish food From his own frame forever. But for us A Tityus is he whom \
vultures rend Prostrate in love, whom anxious anguish eats, Whom troubles of \
any unappeased desires Asunder rip. We have before our eyes Here in this life \
also a Sisyphus In him who seeketh of the populace The rods, the axes fell, \
and evermore Retires a beaten and a gloomy man. For to seek after power- an \
empty name, Nor given at all- and ever in the search To endure a world of \
toil, O this it is To shove with shoulder up the hill a stone Which yet comes \
rolling back from off the top, And headlong makes for levels of the plain. \
Then to be always feeding an ingrate mind, Filling with good things, \
satisfying never- As do the seasons of the year for us, When they return and \
bring their progenies And varied charms, and we are never filled With the \
fruits of life- O this, I fancy, 'tis To pour, like those young virgins in \
the tale, Waters into a sieve, unfilled forever. Cerberus and Furies, and \
that Lack of Light Tartarus, out-belching from his mouth the surge Of \
horrible heat- the which are nowhere, nor Indeed can be: but in this life is \
fear Of retributions just and expiations For evil acts: the dungeon and the \
leap From that dread rock of infamy, the stripes, The executioners, the oaken \
rack, The iron plates, bitumen, and the torch. And even though these are \
absent, yet the mind, With a fore-fearing conscience, plies its goads And \
burns beneath the lash, nor sees meanwhile What terminus of ills, what end of \
pine Can ever be, and feareth lest the same But grow more heavy after death. \
Of truth, The life of fools is Acheron on earth. This also to thy very self \
sometimes Repeat thou mayst: \"Lo, even good Ancus left The sunshine with his \
eyes, in divers things A better man than thou, O worthless hind; And many \
other kings and lords of rule Thereafter have gone under, once who swayed \
O'er mighty peoples. And he also, he- Who whilom paved a highway down the \
sea, And gave his legionaries thoroughfare Along the deep, and taught them \
how to cross The pools of brine afoot, and did contemn, Trampling upon it \
with his cavalry, The bellowings of ocean- poured his soul From dying body, \
as his light was ta'en. And Scipio's son, the thunderbolt of war, Horror of \
Carthage, gave his bones to earth, Like to the lowliest villein in the house. \
Add finders-out of sciences and arts; Add comrades of the Heliconian dames, \
Among whom Homer, sceptered o'er them all, Now lies in slumber sunken with \
the rest. Then, too, Democritus, when ripened eld Admonished him his memory \
waned away, Of own accord offered his head to death. Even Epicurus went, his \
light of life Run out, the man in genius who o'er-topped The human race, \
extinguishing all others, As sun, in ether arisen, all the stars. Wilt thou, \
then, dally, thou complain to go?- For whom already life's as good as dead, \
Whilst yet thou livest and lookest?- who in sleep Wastest thy life- time's \
major part, and snorest Even when awake, and ceasest not to see The stuff of \
dreams, and bearest a mind beset By baseless terror, nor discoverest oft \
What's wrong with thee, when, like a sotted wretch, Thou'rt jostled along by \
many crowding cares, And wanderest reeling round, with mind aswim.\" If men, \
in that same way as on the mind They feel the load that wearies with its \
weight, Could also know the causes whence it comes, And why so great the heap \
of ill on heart, O not in this sort would they live their life, As now so \
much we see them, knowing not What 'tis they want, and seeking ever and ever \
A change of place, as if to drop the burden. The man who sickens of his home \
goes out, Forth from his splendid halls, and straight- returns, Feeling \
i'faith no better off abroad. He races, driving his Gallic ponies along, Down \
to his villa, madly,- as in haste To hurry help to a house afire.- At once He \
yawns, as soon as foot has touched the threshold, Or drowsily goes off in \
sleep and seeks Forgetfulness, or maybe bustles about And makes for town \
again. In such a way Each human flees himself- a self in sooth, As happens, \
he by no means can escape; And willy-nilly he cleaves to it and loathes, \
Sick, sick, and guessing not the cause of ail. Yet should he see but that, O \
chiefly then, Leaving all else, he'd study to divine The nature of things, \
since here is in debate Eternal time and not the single hour, Mortal's estate \
in whatsoever remains After great death. And too, when all is said, What evil \
lust of life is this so great Subdues us to live, so dreadfully distraught In \
perils and alarms? one fixed end Of life abideth for mortality; Death's not \
to shun, and we must go to meet. Besides we're busied with the same devices, \
Ever and ever, and we are at them ever, And there's no new delight that may \
be forged By living on. But whilst the thing we long for Is lacking, that \
seems good above all else; Thereafter, when we've touched it, something else \
We long for; ever one equal thirst of life Grips us agape. And doubtful 'tis \
what fortune The future times may carry, or what be That chance may bring, or \
what the issue next Awaiting us. Nor by prolonging life Take we the least \
away from death's own time, Nor can we pluck one moment off, whereby To \
minish the aeons of our state of death. Therefore, O man, by living on, \
fulfil As many generations as thou may: Eternal death shall there be waiting \
still; And he who died with light of yesterday Shall be no briefer time in \
death's No-more Than he who perished months or years before. BOOK IV PROEM I \
wander afield, thriving in sturdy thought, Through unpathed haunts of the \
Pierides, Trodden by step of none before. I joy To come on undefiled \
fountains there, To drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers, To seek for \
this my head a signal crown From regions where the Muses never yet Have \
garlanded the temples of a man: First, since I teach concerning mighty \
things, And go right on to loose from round the mind The tightened coils of \
dread religion; Next, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame Song so \
pellucid, touching all throughout Even with the Muses' charm- which, as \
'twould seem, Is not without a reasonable ground: For as physicians, when \
they seek to give Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch The brim \
around the cup with the sweet juice And yellow of the honey, in order that \
The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled As far as the lips, and meanwhile \
swallow down The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled, Be yet not \
merely duped, but rather thus Grow strong again with recreated health: So now \
I too (since this my doctrine seems In general somewhat woeful unto those \
Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd Starts back from it in horror) \
have desired To expound our doctrine unto thee in song Soft-speaking and \
Pierian, and, as 'twere, To touch it with sweet honey of the Muse- If by such \
method haply I might hold The mind of thee upon these lines of ours, Till \
thou dost learn the nature of all things And understandest their utility. \
EXISTENCE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES But since I've taught already of what \
sort The seeds of all things are, and how distinct In divers forms they flit \
of own accord, Stirred with a motion everlasting on, And in what mode things \
be from them create, And since I've taught what the mind's nature is, And of \
what things 'tis with the body knit And thrives in strength, and by what mode \
uptorn That mind returns to its primordials, Now will I undertake an \
argument- One for these matters of supreme concern- That there exist those \
somewhats which we call The images of things: these, like to films Scaled off \
the utmost outside of the things, Flit hither and thither through the \
atmosphere, And the same terrify our intellects, Coming upon us waking or in \
sleep, When oft we peer at wonderful strange shapes And images of people lorn \
of light, Which oft have horribly roused us when we lay In slumber- that \
haply nevermore may we Suppose that souls get loose from Acheron, Or shades \
go floating in among the living, Or aught of us is left behind at death, When \
body and mind, destroyed together, each Back to its own primordials goes \
away. And thus I say that effigies of things, And tenuous shapes from off the \
things are sent, From off the utmost outside of the things, Which are like \
films or may be named a rind, Because the image bears like look and form With \
whatso body has shed it fluttering forth- A fact thou mayst, however dull thy \
wits, Well learn from this: mainly, because we see Even 'mongst visible \
objects many be That send forth bodies, loosely some diffused- Like smoke \
from oaken logs and heat from fires- And some more interwoven and condensed- \
As when the locusts in the summertime Put off their glossy tunics, or when \
calves At birth drop membranes from their body's surface, Or when, again, the \
slippery serpent doffs Its vestments 'mongst the thorns- for oft we see The \
breres augmented with their flying spoils: Since such takes place, 'tis \
likewise certain too That tenuous images from things are sent, From off the \
utmost outside of the things. For why those kinds should drop and part from \
things, Rather than others tenuous and thin, No power has man to open mouth \
to tell; Especially, since on outsides of things Are bodies many and minute \
which could, In the same order which they had before, And with the figure of \
their form preserved, Be thrown abroad, and much more swiftly too, Being less \
subject to impediments, As few in number and placed along the front. For \
truly many things we see discharge Their stuff at large, not only from their \
cores Deep-set within, as we have said above, But from their surfaces at \
times no less- Their very colours too. And commonly The awnings, saffron, red \
and dusky blue, Stretched overhead in mighty theatres, Upon their poles and \
cross-beams fluttering, Have such an action quite; for there they dye And \
make to undulate with their every hue The circled throng below, and all the \
stage, And rich attire in the patrician seats. And ever the more the \
theatre's dark walls Around them shut, the more all things within Laugh in \
the bright suffusion of strange glints, The daylight being withdrawn. And \
therefore, since The canvas hangings thus discharge their dye From off their \
surface, things in general must Likewise their tenuous effigies discharge, \
Because in either case they are off-thrown From off the surface. So there are \
indeed Such certain prints and vestiges of forms Which flit around, of \
subtlest texture made, Invisible, when separate, each and one. Again, all \
odour, smoke, and heat, and such Streams out of things diffusedly, because, \
Whilst coming from the deeps of body forth And rising out, along their \
bending path They're torn asunder, nor have gateways straight Wherethrough to \
mass themselves and struggle abroad. But contrariwise, when such a tenuous \
film Of outside colour is thrown off, there's naught Can rend it, since 'tis \
placed along the front Ready to hand. Lastly those images Which to our eyes \
in mirrors do appear, In water, or in any shining surface, Must be, since \
furnished with like look of things, Fashioned from images of things sent out. \
There are, then, tenuous effigies of forms, Like unto them, which no one can \
divine When taken singly, which do yet give back, When by continued and \
recurrent discharge Expelled, a picture from the mirrors' plane. Nor \
otherwise, it seems, can they be kept So well conserved that thus be given \
back Figures so like each object. Now then, learn How tenuous is the nature \
of an image. And in the first place, since primordials be So far beneath our \
senses, and much less E'en than those objects which begin to grow Too small \
for eyes to note, learn now in few How nice are the beginnings of all things- \
That this, too, I may yet confirm in proof: First, living creatures are \
sometimes so small That even their third part can nowise be seen; Judge, \
then, the size of any inward organ- What of their sphered heart, their eyes, \
their limbs, The skeleton?- How tiny thus they are! And what besides of those \
first particles Whence soul and mind must fashioned be?- Seest not How nice \
and how minute? Besides, whatever Exhales from out its body a sharp smell- \
The nauseous absinth, or the panacea, Strong southernwood, or bitter \
centaury- If never so lightly with thy [fingers] twain Perchance [thou touch] \
a one of them Then why not rather know that images Flit hither and thither, \
many, in many modes, Bodiless and invisible? But lest Haply thou holdest that \
those images Which come from objects are the sole that flit, Others indeed \
there be of own accord Begot, self-formed in earth's aery skies, Which, \
moulded to innumerable shapes, Are borne aloft, and, fluid as they are, Cease \
not to change appearance and to turn Into new outlines of all sorts of forms; \
As we behold the clouds grow thick on high And smirch the serene vision of \
the world, Stroking the air with motions. For oft are seen The giants' faces \
flying far along And trailing a spread of shadow; and at times The mighty \
mountains and mountain-sundered rocks Going before and crossing on the sun, \
Whereafter a monstrous beast dragging amain And leading in the other \
thunderheads. Now [hear] how easy and how swift they be Engendered, and \
perpetually flow off From things and gliding pass away.... For ever every \
outside streams away From off all objects, since discharge they may; And when \
this outside reaches other things, As chiefly glass, it passes through; but \
where It reaches the rough rocks or stuff of wood, There 'tis so rent that it \
cannot give back An image. But when gleaming objects dense, As chiefly \
mirrors, have been set before it, Nothing of this sort happens. For it can't \
Go, as through glass, nor yet be rent- its safety, By virtue of that \
smoothness, being sure. 'Tis therefore that from them the images Stream back \
to us; and howso suddenly Thou place, at any instant, anything Before a \
mirror, there an image shows; Proving that ever from a body's surface Flow \
off thin textures and thin shapes of things. Thus many images in little time \
Are gendered; so their origin is named Rightly a speedy. And even as the sun \
Must send below, in little time, to earth So many beams to keep all things so \
full Of light incessant; thus, on grounds the same, From things there must be \
borne, in many modes, To every quarter round, upon the moment, The many \
images of things; because Unto whatever face of things we turn The mirror, \
things of form and hue the same Respond. Besides, though but a moment since \
Serenest was the weather of the sky, So fiercely sudden is it foully thick \
That ye might think that round about all murk Had parted forth from Acheron \
and filled The mighty vaults of sky- so grievously, As gathers thus the \
storm-clouds' gruesome night, Do faces of black horror hang on high- Of which \
how small a part an image is There's none to tell or reckon out in words. Now \
come; with what swift motion they are borne, These images, and what the speed \
assigned To them across the breezes swimming on- So that o'er lengths of \
space a little hour Alone is wasted, toward whatever region Each with its \
divers impulse tends- I'll tell In verses sweeter than they many are; Even as \
the swan's slight note is better far Than that dispersed clamour of the \
cranes Among the southwind's aery clouds. And first, One oft may see that \
objects which are light And made of tiny bodies are the swift; In which class \
is the sun's light and his heat, Since made from small primordial elements \
Which, as it were, are forward knocked along And through the interspaces of \
the air To pass delay not, urged by blows behind; For light by light is \
instantly supplied And gleam by following gleam is spurred and driven. Thus \
likewise must the images have power Through unimaginable space to speed \
Within a point of time,- first, since a cause Exceeding small there is, which \
at their back Far forward drives them and propels, where, too, They're \
carried with such winged lightness on; And, secondly, since furnished, when \
sent off, With texture of such rareness that they can Through objects \
whatsoever penetrate And ooze, as 'twere, through intervening air. Besides, \
if those fine particles of things Which from so deep within are sent abroad, \
As light and heat of sun, are seen to glide And spread themselves through all \
the space of heaven Upon one instant of the day, and fly O'er sea and lands \
and flood the heaven, what then Of those which on the outside stand prepared, \
When they're hurled off with not a thing to check Their going out? Dost thou \
not see indeed How swifter and how farther must they go And speed through \
manifold the length of space In time the same that from the sun the rays \
O'erspread the heaven? This also seems to be Example chief and true with what \
swift speed The images of things are borne about: That soon as ever under \
open skies Is spread the shining water, all at once, If stars be out in \
heaven, upgleam from earth, Serene and radiant in the water there, The \
constellations of the universe- Now seest thou not in what a point of time An \
image from the shores of ether falls Unto the shores of earth? Wherefore, \
again, And yet again, 'tis needful to confess With wondrous... THE SENSES AND \
MENTAL PICTURES Bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight. From certain \
things flow odours evermore, As cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray \
From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls Around the coasts. Nor ever cease to \
flit The varied voices, sounds athrough the air. Then too there comes into \
the mouth at times The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea We roam about; \
and so, whene'er we watch The wormword being mixed, its bitter stings. To \
such degree from all things is each thing Borne streamingly along, and sent \
about To every region round; and nature grants Nor rest nor respite of the \
onward flow, Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have, And all the time are \
suffered to descry And smell all things at hand, and hear them sound. \
Besides, since shape examined by our hands Within the dark is known to be the \
same As that by eyes perceived within the light And lustrous day, both touch \
and sight must be By one like cause aroused. So, if we test A square and get \
its stimulus on us Within the dark, within the light what square Can fall \
upon our sight, except a square That images the things? Wherefore it seems \
The source of seeing is in images, Nor without these can anything be viewed. \
Now these same films I name are borne about And tossed and scattered into \
regions all. But since we do perceive alone through eyes, It follows hence \
that whitherso we turn Our sight, all things do strike against it there With \
form and hue. And just how far from us Each thing may be away, the image \
yields To us the power to see and chance to tell: For when 'tis sent, at once \
it shoves ahead And drives along the air that's in the space Betwixt it and \
our eyes. And thus this air All glides athrough our eyeballs, and, as 'twere, \
Brushes athrough our pupils and thuswise Passes across. Therefore it comes we \
see How far from us each thing may be away, And the more air there be that's \
driven before, And too the longer be the brushing breeze Against our eyes, \
the farther off removed Each thing is seen to be: forsooth, this work With \
mightily swift order all goes on, So that upon one instant we may see What \
kind the object and how far away. Nor over-marvellous must this be deemed In \
these affairs that, though the films which strike Upon the eyes cannot be \
singly seen, The things themselves may be perceived. For thus When the wind \
beats upon us stroke by stroke And when the sharp cold streams, 'tis not our \
wont To feel each private particle of wind Or of that cold, but rather all at \
once; And so we see how blows affect our body, As if one thing were beating \
on the same And giving us the feel of its own body Outside of us. Again, \
whene'er we thump With finger-tip upon a stone, we touch But the rock's \
surface and the outer hue, Nor feel that hue by contact- rather feel The very \
hardness deep within the rock. Now come, and why beyond a looking-glass An \
image may be seen, perceive. For seen It soothly is, removed far within. 'Tis \
the same sort as objects peered upon Outside in their true shape, whene'er a \
door Yields through itself an open peering-place, And lets us see so many \
things outside Beyond the house. Also that sight is made By a twofold twin \
air: for first is seen The air inside the door-posts; next the doors, The \
twain to left and right; and afterwards A light beyond comes brushing through \
our eyes, Then other air, then objects peered upon Outside in their true \
shape. And thus, when first The image of the glass projects itself, As to our \
gaze it comes, it shoves ahead And drives along the air that's in the space \
Betwixt it and our eyes, and brings to pass That we perceive the air ere yet \
the glass. But when we've also seen the glass itself, Forthwith that image \
which from us is borne Reaches the glass, and there thrown back again Comes \
back unto our eyes, and driving rolls Ahead of itself another air, that then \
'Tis this we see before itself, and thus It looks so far removed behind the \
glass. Wherefore again, again, there's naught for wonder In those which \
render from the mirror's plane A vision back, since each thing comes to pass \
By means of the two airs. Now, in the glass The right part of our members is \
observed Upon the left, because, when comes the image Hitting against the \
level of the glass, 'Tis not returned unshifted; but forced off Backwards in \
line direct and not oblique,- Exactly as whoso his plaster-mask Should dash, \
before 'twere dry, on post or beam, And it should straightway keep, at \
clinging there, Its shape, reversed, facing him who threw, And so remould the \
features it gives back: It comes that now the right eye is the left, The left \
the right. An image too may be From mirror into mirror handed on, Until of \
idol-films even five or six Have thus been gendered. For whatever things \
Shall hide back yonder in the house, the same, However far removed in \
twisting ways, May still be all brought forth through bending paths And by \
these several mirrors seen to be Within the house, since nature so compels \
All things to be borne backward and spring off At equal angles from all other \
things. To such degree the image gleams across From mirror unto mirror; where \
'twas left It comes to be the right, and then again Returns and changes round \
unto the left. Again, those little sides of mirrors curved Proportionate to \
the bulge of our own flank Send back to us their idols with the right Upon \
the right; and this is so because Either the image is passed on along From \
mirror unto mirror, and thereafter, When twice dashed off, flies back unto \
ourselves; Or else the image wheels itself around, When once unto the mirror \
it has come, Since the curved surface teaches it to turn To usward. Further, \
thou might'st well believe That these film-idols step along with us And set \
their feet in unison with ours And imitate our carriage, since from that Part \
of a mirror whence thou hast withdrawn Straightway no images can be returned. \
Further, our eye-balls tend to flee the bright And shun to gaze thereon; the \
sun even blinds, If thou goest on to strain them unto him, Because his \
strength is mighty, and the films Heavily downward from on high are borne \
Through the pure ether and the viewless winds, And strike the eyes, \
disordering their joints. So piecing lustre often burns the eyes, Because it \
holdeth many seeds of fire Which, working into eyes, engender pain. Again, \
whatever jaundiced people view Becomes wan-yellow, since from out their \
bodies Flow many seeds wan-yellow forth to meet The films of things, and many \
too are mixed Within their eye, which by contagion paint All things with \
sallowness. Again, we view From dark recesses things that stand in light, \
Because, when first has entered and possessed The open eyes this nearer \
darkling air, Swiftly the shining air and luminous Followeth in, which purges \
then the eyes And scatters asunder of that other air The sable shadows, for \
in large degrees This air is nimbler, nicer, and more strong. And soon as \
ever 'thas filled and oped with light The pathways of the eyeballs, which \
before Black air had blocked, there follow straightaway Those films of things \
out-standing in the light, Provoking vision- what we cannot do From out the \
light with objects in the dark, Because that denser darkling air behind \
Followeth in, and fills each aperture And thus blockades the pathways of the \
eyes That there no images of any things Can be thrown in and agitate the \
eyes. And when from far away we do behold The squared towers of a city, oft \
Rounded they seem,- on this account because Each distant angle is perceived \
obtuse, Or rather it is not perceived at all; And perishes its blow nor to \
our gaze Arrives its stroke, since through such length of air Are borne along \
the idols that the air Makes blunt the idol of the angle's point By numerous \
collidings. When thuswise The angles of the tower each and all Have quite \
escaped the sense, the stones appear As rubbed and rounded on a turner's \
wheel- Yet not like objects near and truly round, But with a semblance to \
them, shadowily. Likewise, our shadow in the sun appears To move along and \
follow our own steps And imitate our carriage- if thou thinkest Air that is \
thus bereft of light can walk, Following the gait and motion of mankind. For \
what we use to name a shadow, sure Is naught but air deprived of light. No \
marvel: Because the earth from spot to spot is reft Progressively of light of \
sun, whenever In moving round we get within its way, While any spot of earth \
by us abandoned Is filled with light again, on this account It comes to pass \
that what was body's shadow Seems still the same to follow after us In one \
straight course. Since, evermore pour in New lights of rays, and perish then \
the old, Just like the wool that's drawn into the flame. Therefore the earth \
is easily spoiled of light And easily refilled and from herself Washeth the \
black shadows quite away. And yet in this we don't at all concede That eyes \
be cheated. For their task it is To note in whatsoever place be light, In \
what be shadow: whether or no the gleams Be still the same, and whether the \
shadow which Just now was here is that one passing thither, Or whether the \
facts be what we said above, 'Tis after all the reasoning of mind That must \
decide; nor can our eyeballs know The nature of reality. And so Attach thou \
not this fault of mind to eyes, Nor lightly think our senses everywhere Are \
tottering. The ship in which we sail Is borne along, although it seems to \
stand; The ship that bides in roadstead is supposed There to be passing by. \
And hills and fields Seem fleeing fast astern, past which we urge The ship \
and fly under the bellying sails. The stars, each one, do seem to pause, \
affixed To the ethereal caverns, though they all Forever are in motion, \
rising out And thence revisiting their far descents When they have measured \
with their bodies bright The span of heaven. And likewise sun and moon Seem \
biding in a roadstead,- objects which, As plain fact proves, are really borne \
along. Between two mountains far away aloft From midst the whirl of waters \
open lies A gaping exit for the fleet, and yet They seem conjoined in a \
single isle. When boys themselves have stopped their spinning round, The \
halls still seem to whirl and posts to reel, Until they now must almost think \
the roofs Threaten to ruin down upon their heads. And now, when nature begins \
to lift on high The sun's red splendour and the tremulous fires, And raise \
him o'er the mountain-tops, those mountains- O'er which he seemeth then to \
thee to be, His glowing self hard by atingeing them With his own fire- are \
yet away from us Scarcely two thousand arrow-shots, indeed Oft scarce five \
hundred courses of a dart; Although between those mountains and the sun Lie \
the huge plains of ocean spread beneath The vasty shores of ether, and \
intervene A thousand lands, possessed by many a folk And generations of wild \
beasts. Again, A pool of water of but a finger's depth, Which lies between \
the stones along the pave, Offers a vision downward into earth As far, as \
from the earth o'erspread on high The gulfs of heaven; that thus thou seemest \
to view Clouds down below and heavenly bodies plunged Wondrously in heaven \
under earth. Then too, when in the middle of the stream Sticks fast our \
dashing horse, and down we gaze Into the river's rapid waves, some force \
Seems then to bear the body of the horse, Though standing still, reversely \
from his course, And swiftly push up-stream. And wheresoe'er We cast our eyes \
across, all objects seem Thus to be onward borne and flow along In the same \
way as we. A portico, Albeit it stands well propped from end to end On equal \
columns, parallel and big, Contracts by stages in a narrow cone, When from \
one end the long, long whole is seen,- Until, conjoining ceiling with the \
floor, And the whole right side with the left, it draws Together to a cone's \
nigh-viewless point. To sailors on the main the sun he seems From out the \
waves to rise, and in the waves To set and bury his light- because indeed \
They gaze on naught but water and the sky. Again, to gazers ignorant of the \
sea, Vessels in port seem, as with broken poops, To lean upon the water, \
quite agog; For any portion of the oars that's raised Above the briny spray \
is straight, and straight The rudders from above. But other parts, Those \
sunk, immersed below the water-line, Seem broken all and bended and inclined \
Sloping to upwards, and turned back to float Almost atop the water. And when \
the winds Carry the scattered drifts along the sky In the night-time, then \
seem to glide along The radiant constellations 'gainst the clouds And there \
on high to take far other course From that whereon in truth they're borne. \
And then, If haply our hand be set beneath one eye And press below thereon, \
then to our gaze Each object which we gaze on seems to be, By some sensation \
twain- then twain the lights Of lampions burgeoning in flowers of flame, And \
twain the furniture in all the house, Two-fold the visages of fellow-men, And \
twain their bodies. And again, when sleep Has bound our members down in \
slumber soft And all the body lies in deep repose, Yet then we seem to self \
to be awake And move our members; and in night's blind gloom We think to mark \
the daylight and the sun; And, shut within a room, yet still we seem To \
change our skies, our oceans, rivers, hills, To cross the plains afoot, and \
hear new sounds, Though still the austere silence of the night Abides around \
us, and to speak replies, Though voiceless. Other cases of the sort \
Wondrously many do we see, which all Seek, so to say, to injure faith in \
sense- In vain, because the largest part of these Deceives through mere \
opinions of the mind, Which we do add ourselves, feigning to see What by the \
senses are not seen at all. For naught is harder than to separate Plain facts \
from dubious, which the mind forthwith Adds by itself. Again, if one suppose \
That naught is known, he knows not whether this Itself is able to be known, \
since he Confesses naught to know. Therefore with him I waive discussion- who \
has set his head Even where his feet should be. But let me grant That this he \
knows,- I question: whence he knows What 'tis to know and not-to-know in \
turn, And what created concept of the truth, And what device has proved the \
dubious To differ from the certain?- since in things He's heretofore seen \
naught of true. Thou'lt find That from the senses first hath been create \
Concept of truth, nor can the senses be Rebutted. For criterion must be found \
Worthy of greater trust, which shall defeat Through own authority the false \
by true; What, then, than these our senses must there be Worthy a greater \
trust? Shall reason, sprung From some false sense, prevail to contradict \
Those senses, sprung as reason wholly is From out the senses?- For lest these \
be true, All reason also then is falsified. Or shall the ears have power to \
blame the eyes, Or yet the touch the ears? Again, shall taste Accuse this \
touch or shall the nose confute Or eyes defeat it? Methinks not so it is: For \
unto each has been divided off Its function quite apart, its power to each; \
And thus we're still constrained to perceive The soft, the cold, the hot \
apart, apart All divers hues and whatso things there be Conjoined with hues. \
Likewise the tasting tongue Has its own power apart, and smells apart And \
sounds apart are known. And thus it is That no one sense can e'er convict \
another. Nor shall one sense have power to blame itself, Because it always \
must be deemed the same, Worthy of equal trust. And therefore what At any \
time unto these senses showed, The same is true. And if the reason be Unable \
to unravel us the cause Why objects, which at hand were square, afar Seemed \
rounded, yet it more availeth us, Lacking the reason, to pretend a cause For \
each configuration, than to let From out our hands escape the obvious things \
And injure primal faith in sense, and wreck All those foundations upon which \
do rest Our life and safety. For not only reason Would topple down; but even \
our very life Would straightaway collapse, unless we dared To trust our \
senses and to keep away From headlong heights and places to be shunned Of a \
like peril, and to seek with speed Their opposites! Again, as in a building, \
If the first plumb-line be askew, and if The square deceiving swerve from \
lines exact, And if the level waver but the least In any part, the whole \
construction then Must turn out faulty- shelving and askew, Leaning to back \
and front, incongruous, That now some portions seem about to fall, And falls \
the whole ere long- betrayed indeed By first deceiving estimates: so too Thy \
calculations in affairs of life Must be askew and false, if sprung for thee \
From senses false. So all that troop of words Marshalled against the senses \
is quite vain. And now remains to demonstrate with ease How other senses each \
their things perceive. Firstly, a sound and every voice is heard, When, \
getting into ears, they strike the sense With their own body. For confess we \
must Even voice and sound to be corporeal, Because they're able on the sense \
to strike. Besides voice often scrapes against the throat, And screams in \
going out do make more rough The wind-pipe- naturally enough, methinks, When, \
through the narrow exit rising up In larger throng, these primal germs of \
voice Have thus begun to issue forth. In sooth, Also the door of the mouth is \
scraped against [By air blown outward] from distended [cheeks]. And thus no \
doubt there is, that voice and words Consist of elements corporeal, With \
power to pain. Nor art thou unaware Likewise how much of body's ta'en away, \
How much from very thews and powers of men May be withdrawn by steady talk, \
prolonged Even from the rising splendour of the morn To shadows of black \
evening,- above all If 't be outpoured with most exceeding shouts. Therefore \
the voice must be corporeal, Since the long talker loses from his frame A \
part. Moreover, roughness in the sound Comes from the roughness in the primal \
germs, As a smooth sound from smooth ones is create; Nor have these elements \
a form the same When the trump rumbles with a hollow roar, As when barbaric \
Berecynthian pipe Buzzes with raucous boomings, or when swans By night from \
icy shores of Helicon With wailing voices raise their liquid dirge. Thus, \
when from deep within our frame we force These voices, and at mouth expel \
them forth, The mobile tongue, artificer of words, Makes them articulate, and \
too the lips By their formations share in shaping them. Hence when the space \
is short from starting-point To where that voice arrives, the very words Must \
too be plainly heard, distinctly marked. For then the voice conserves its own \
formation, Conserves its shape. But if the space between Be longer than is \
fit, the words must be Through the much air confounded, and the voice \
Disordered in its flight across the winds- And so it haps, that thou canst \
sound perceive, Yet not determine what the words may mean; To such degree \
confounded and encumbered The voice approaches us. Again, one word, Sent from \
the crier's mouth, may rouse all ears Among the populace. And thus one voice \
Scatters asunder into many voices, Since it divides itself for separate ears, \
Imprinting form of word and a clear tone. But whatso part of voices fails to \
hit The ears themselves perishes, borne beyond, Idly diffused among the \
winds. A part, Beating on solid porticoes, tossed back Returns a sound; and \
sometimes mocks the ear With a mere phantom of a word. When this Thou well \
hast noted, thou canst render count Unto thyself and others why it is Along \
the lonely places that the rocks Give back like shapes of words in order \
like, When search we after comrades wandering Among the shady mountains, and \
aloud Call unto them, the scattered. I have seen Spots that gave back even \
voices six or seven For one thrown forth- for so the very hills, Dashing them \
back against the hills, kept on With their reverberations. And these spots \
The neighbouring country-side doth feign to be Haunts of the goat-foot satyrs \
and the nymphs; And tells ye there be fauns, by whose night noise And antic \
revels yonder they declare The voiceless silences are broken oft, And tones \
of strings are made and wailings sweet Which the pipe, beat by players' \
finger-tips, Pours out; and far and wide the farmer-race Begins to hear, \
when, shaking the garmentings Of pine upon his half-beast head, god-Pan With \
puckered lip oft runneth o'er and o'er The open reeds,- lest flute should \
cease to pour The woodland music! Other prodigies And wonders of this ilk \
they love to tell, Lest they be thought to dwell in lonely spots And even by \
gods deserted. This is why They boast of marvels in their story-tellings; Or \
by some other reason are led on- Greedy, as all mankind hath ever been, To \
prattle fables into ears. Again, One need not wonder how it comes about That \
through those places (through which eyes cannot View objects manifest) sounds \
yet may pass And assail the ears. For often we observe People conversing, \
though the doors be closed; No marvel either, since all voice unharmed Can \
wind through bended apertures of things, While idol-films decline to- for \
they're rent, Unless along straight apertures they swim, Like those in glass, \
through which all images Do fly across. And yet this voice itself, In passing \
through shut chambers of a house, Is dulled, and in a jumble enters ears, And \
sound we seem to hear far more than words. Moreover, a voice is into all \
directions Divided up, since off from one another New voices are engendered, \
when one voice Hath once leapt forth, outstarting into many- As oft a spark \
of fire is wont to sprinkle Itself into its several fires. And so, Voices do \
fill those places hid behind, Which all are in a hubbub round about, Astir \
with sound. But idol-films do tend, As once sent forth, in straight \
directions all; Wherefore one can inside a wall see naught, Yet catch the \
voices from beyond the same. Nor tongue and palate, whereby we flavour feel, \
Present more problems for more work of thought. Firstly, we feel a flavour in \
the mouth, When forth we squeeze it, in chewing up our food,- As any one \
perchance begins to squeeze With hand and dry a sponge with water soaked. \
Next, all which forth we squeeze is spread about Along the pores and \
intertwined paths Of the loose-textured tongue. And so, when smooth The \
bodies of the oozy flavour, then Delightfully they touch, delightfully They \
treat all spots, around the wet and trickling Enclosures of the tongue. And \
contrariwise, They sting and pain the sense with their assault, According as \
with roughness they're supplied. Next, only up to palate is the pleasure \
Coming from flavour; for in truth when down 'Thas plunged along the throat, \
no pleasure is, Whilst into all the frame it spreads around; Nor aught it \
matters with what food is fed The body, if only what thou take thou canst \
Distribute well digested to the frame And keep the stomach in a moist career. \
Now, how it is we see some food for some, Others for others.... I will \
unfold, or wherefore what to some Is foul and bitter, yet the same to others \
Can seem delectable to eat,- why here So great the distance and the \
difference is That what is food to one to some becomes Fierce poison, as a \
certain snake there is Which, touched by spittle of a man, will waste And end \
itself by gnawing up its coil. Again, fierce poison is the hellebore To us, \
but puts the fat on goats and quails. That thou mayst know by what devices \
this Is brought about, in chief thou must recall What we have said before, \
that seeds are kept Commixed in things in divers modes. Again, As all the \
breathing creatures which take food Are outwardly unlike, and outer cut And \
contour of their members bounds them round, Each differing kind by kind, they \
thus consist Of seeds of varying shape. And furthermore, Since seeds do \
differ, divers too must be The interstices and paths (which we do call The \
apertures) in all the members, even In mouth and palate too. Thus some must \
be More small or yet more large, three-cornered some And others squared, and \
many others round, And certain of them many-angled too In many modes. For, as \
the combination And motion of their divers shapes demand, The shapes of \
apertures must be diverse And paths must vary according to their walls That \
bound them. Hence when what is sweet to some, Becomes to others bitter, for \
him to whom 'Tis sweet, the smoothest particles must needs Have entered \
caressingly the palate's pores. And, contrariwise, with those to whom that \
sweet Is sour within the mouth, beyond a doubt The rough and barbed particles \
have got Into the narrows of the apertures. Now easy it is from these affairs \
to know Whatever... Indeed, where one from o'er-abundant bile Is stricken \
with fever, or in other wise Feels the roused violence of some malady, There \
the whole frame is now upset, and there All the positions of the seeds are \
changed,- So that the bodies which before were fit To cause the savour, now \
are fit no more, And now more apt are others which be able To get within the \
pores and gender sour. Both sorts, in sooth, are intermixed in honey- What \
oft we've proved above to thee before. Now come, and I will indicate what \
wise Impact of odour on the nostrils touches. And first, 'tis needful there \
be many things From whence the streaming flow of varied odours May roll \
along, and we're constrained to think They stream and dart and sprinkle \
themselves about Impartially. But for some breathing creatures One odour is \
more apt, to others another- Because of differing forms of seeds and pores. \
Thus on and on along the zephyrs bees Are led by odour of honey, vultures too \
By carcasses. Again, the forward power Of scent in dogs doth lead the hunter \
on Whithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast Hath hastened its career; and \
the white goose, The saviour of the Roman citadel, Forescents afar the odour \
of mankind. Thus, diversly to divers ones is given Peculiar smell that \
leadeth each along To his own food or makes him start aback From loathsome \
poison, and in this wise are The generations of the wild preserved. Yet is \
this pungence not alone in odours Or in the class of flavours; but, likewise, \
The look of things and hues agree not all So well with senses unto all, but \
that Some unto some will be, to gaze upon, More keen and painful. Lo, the \
raving lions, They dare not face and gaze upon the cock Who's wont with wings \
to flap away the night From off the stage, and call the beaming morn With \
clarion voice- and lions straightway thus Bethink themselves of flight, \
because, ye see, Within the body of the cocks there be Some certain seeds, \
which, into lions' eyes Injected, bore into the pupils deep And yield such \
piercing pain they can't hold out Against the cocks, however fierce they be- \
Whilst yet these seeds can't hurt our gaze the least, Either because they do \
not penetrate, Or since they have free exit from the eyes As soon as \
penetrating, so that thus They cannot hurt our eyes in any part By there \
remaining. To speak once more of odour; Whatever assail the nostrils, some \
can travel A longer way than others. None of them, However, 's borne so far \
as sound or voice- While I omit all mention of such things As hit the \
eyesight and assail the vision. For slowly on a wandering course it comes And \
perishes sooner, by degrees absorbed Easily into all the winds of air;- And \
first, because from deep inside the thing It is discharged with labour (for \
the fact That every object, when 'tis shivered, ground, Or crumbled by the \
fire, will smell the stronger Is sign that odours flow and part away From \
inner regions of the things). And next, Thou mayest see that odour is create \
Of larger primal germs than voice, because It enters not through stony walls, \
wherethrough Unfailingly the voice and sound are borne; Wherefore, besides, \
thou wilt observe 'tis not So easy to trace out in whatso place The smelling \
object is. For, dallying on Along the winds, the particles cool off, And then \
the scurrying messengers of things Arrive our senses, when no longer hot. So \
dogs oft wander astray, and hunt the scent. Now mark, and hear what objects \
move the mind, And learn, in few, whence unto intellect Do come what come. \
And first I tell thee this: That many images of objects rove In many modes to \
every region round- So thin that easily the one with other, When once they \
meet, uniteth in mid-air, Like gossamer or gold-leaf. For, indeed, Far \
thinner are they in their fabric than Those images which take a hold on eyes \
And smite the vision, since through body's pores They penetrate, and inwardly \
stir up The subtle nature of mind and smite the sense. Thus, Centaurs and the \
limbs of Scyllas, thus The Cerberus-visages of dogs we see, And images of \
people gone before- Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago; Because the \
images of every kind Are everywhere about us borne- in part Those which are \
gendered in the very air Of own accord, in part those others which From \
divers things do part away, and those Which are compounded, made from out \
their shapes. For soothly from no living Centaur is That phantom gendered, \
since no breed of beast Like him was ever; but, when images Of horse and man \
by chance have come together, They easily cohere, as aforesaid, At once, \
through subtle nature and fabric thin. In the same fashion others of this ilk \
Created are. And when they're quickly borne In their exceeding lightness, \
easily (As earlier I showed) one subtle image, Compounded, moves by its one \
blow the mind, Itself so subtle and so strangely quick. That these things \
come to pass as I record, From this thou easily canst understand: So far as \
one is unto other like, Seeing with mind as well as with the eyes Must come \
to pass in fashion not unlike. Well, now, since I have shown that I perceive \
Haply a lion through those idol-films Such as assail my eyes, 'tis thine to \
know Also the mind is in like manner moved, And sees, nor more nor less than \
eyes do see (Except that it perceives more subtle films) The lion and aught \
else through idol-films. And when the sleep has overset our frame, The mind's \
intelligence is now awake, Still for no other reason, save that these- The \
self-same films as when we are awake- Assail our minds, to such degree indeed \
That we do seem to see for sure the man Whom, void of life, now death and \
earth have gained Dominion over. And nature forces this To come to pass \
because the body's senses Are resting, thwarted through the members all, \
Unable now to conquer false with true; And memory lies prone and languishes \
In slumber, nor protests that he, the man Whom the mind feigns to see alive, \
long since Hath been the gain of death and dissolution. And further, 'tis no \
marvel idols move And toss their arms and other members round In rhythmic \
time- and often in men's sleeps It haps an image this is seen to do; In \
sooth, when perishes the former image, And other is gendered of another pose, \
That former seemeth to have changed its gestures. Of course the change must \
be conceived as speedy; So great the swiftness and so great the store Of \
idol-things, and (in an instant brief As mind can mark) so great, again, the \
store Of separate idol-parts to bring supplies. It happens also that there is \
supplied Sometimes an image not of kind the same; But what before was woman, \
now at hand Is seen to stand there, altered into male; Or other visage, other \
age succeeds; But slumber and oblivion take care That we shall feel no wonder \
at the thing. And much in these affairs demands inquiry, And much, \
illumination- if we crave With plainness to exhibit facts. And first, Why \
doth the mind of one to whom the whim To think has come behold forthwith that \
thing? Or do the idols watch upon our will, And doth an image unto us occur, \
Directly we desire- if heart prefer The sea, the land, or after all the sky? \
Assemblies of the citizens, parades, Banquets, and battles, these and all \
doth she, Nature, create and furnish at our word?- Maugre the fact that in \
same place and spot Another's mind is meditating things All far unlike. And \
what, again, of this: When we in sleep behold the idols step, In measure, \
forward, moving supple limbs, Whilst forth they put each supple arm in turn \
With speedy motion, and with eyeing heads Repeat the movement, as the foot \
keeps time? Forsooth, the idols they are steeped in art, And wander to and \
fro well taught indeed,- Thus to be able in the time of night To make such \
games! Or will the truth be this: Because in one least moment that we mark- \
That is, the uttering of a single sound- There lurk yet many moments, which \
the reason Discovers to exist, therefore it comes That, in a moment how so \
brief ye will, The divers idols are hard by, and ready Each in its place \
diverse? So great the swiftness, So great, again, the store of idol-things, \
And so, when perishes the former image, And other is gendered of another \
pose, The former seemeth to have changed its gestures. And since they be so \
tenuous, mind can mark Sharply alone the ones it strains to see; And thus the \
rest do perish one and all, Save those for which the mind prepares itself. \
Further, it doth prepare itself indeed, And hopes to see what follows after \
each- Hence this result. For hast thou not observed How eyes, essaying to \
perceive the fine, Will strain in preparation, otherwise Unable sharply to \
perceive at all? Yet know thou canst that, even in objects plain, If thou \
attendest not, 'tis just the same As if 'twere all the time removed and far. \
What marvel, then, that mind doth lose the rest, Save those to which 'thas \
given up itself? So 'tis that we conjecture from small signs Things wide and \
weighty, and involve ourselves In snarls of self-deceit. SOME VITAL FUNCTIONS \
In these affairs We crave that thou wilt passionately flee The one offence, \
and anxiously wilt shun The error of presuming the clear lights Of eyes \
created were that we might see; Or thighs and knees, aprop upon the feet, \
Thuswise can bended be, that we might step With goodly strides ahead; or \
forearms joined Unto the sturdy uppers, or serving hands On either side were \
given, that we might do Life's own demands. All such interpretation Is \
aft-for-fore with inverse reasoning, Since naught is born in body so that we \
May use the same, but birth engenders use: No seeing ere the lights of eyes \
were born, No speaking ere the tongue created was; But origin of tongue came \
long before Discourse of words, and ears created were Much earlier than any \
sound was heard; And all the members, so meseems, were there Before they got \
their use: and therefore, they Could not be gendered for the sake of use. But \
contrariwise, contending in the fight With hand to hand, and rending of the \
joints, And fouling of the limbs with gore, was there, O long before the \
gleaming spears ere flew; And nature prompted man to shun a wound, Before the \
left arm by the aid of art Opposed the shielding targe. And, verily, Yielding \
the weary body to repose, Far ancienter than cushions of soft beds, And \
quenching thirst is earlier than cups. These objects, therefore, which for \
use and life Have been devised, can be conceived as found For sake of using. \
But apart from such Are all which first were born and afterwards Gave \
knowledge of their own utility- Chief in which sort we note the senses, \
limbs: Wherefore, again, 'tis quite beyond thy power To hold that these could \
thus have been create For office of utility. Likewise, 'Tis nothing strange \
that all the breathing creatures Seek, even by nature of their frame, their \
food. Yes, since I've taught thee that from off the things Stream and depart \
innumerable bodies In modes innumerable too; but most Must be the bodies \
streaming from the living- Which bodies, vexed by motion evermore, Are \
through the mouth exhaled innumerable, When weary creatures pant, or through \
the sweat Squeezed forth innumerable from deep within. Thus body rarefies, so \
undermined In all its nature, and pain attends its state. And so the food is \
taken to underprop The tottering joints, and by its interfusion To re-create \
their powers, and there stop up The longing, open-mouthed through limbs and \
veins, For eating. And the moist no less departs Into all regions that demand \
the moist; And many heaped-up particles of hot, Which cause such burnings in \
these bellies of ours, The liquid on arriving dissipates And quenches like a \
fire, that parching heat No longer now can scorch the frame. And so, Thou \
seest how panting thirst is washed away From off our body, how the \
hunger-pang It, too, appeased. Now, how it comes that we, Whene'er we wish, \
can step with strides ahead, And how 'tis given to move our limbs about, And \
what device is wont to push ahead This the big load of our corporeal frame, \
I'll say to thee- do thou attend what's said. I say that first some \
idol-films of walking Into our mind do fall and smite the mind, As said \
before. Thereafter will arises; For no one starts to do a thing, before The \
intellect previsions what it wills; And what it there pre-visioneth depends \
On what that image is. When, therefore, mind Doth so bestir itself that it \
doth will To go and step along, it strikes at once That energy of soul that's \
sown about In all the body through the limbs and frame- And this is easy of \
performance, since The soul is close conjoined with the mind. Next, soul in \
turn strikes body, and by degrees Thus the whole mass is pushed along and \
moved. Then too the body rarefies, and air, Forsooth as ever of such \
nimbleness, Comes on and penetrates aboundingly Through opened pores, and \
thus is sprinkled round Unto all smallest places in our frame. Thus then by \
these twain factors, severally, Body is borne like ship with oars and wind. \
Nor yet in these affairs is aught for wonder That particles so fine can whirl \
around So great a body and turn this weight of ours; For wind, so tenuous \
with its subtle body, Yet pushes, driving on the mighty ship Of mighty bulk; \
one hand directs the same, Whatever its momentum, and one helm Whirls it \
around, whither ye please; and loads, Many and huge, are moved and hoisted \
high By enginery of pulley-blocks and wheels, With but light strain. Now, by \
what modes this sleep Pours through our members waters of repose And frees \
the breast from cares of mind, I'll tell In verses sweeter than they many \
are; Even as the swan's slight note is better far Than that dispersed clamour \
of the cranes Among the southwind's aery clouds. Do thou Give me sharp ears \
and a sagacious mind,- That thou mayst not deny the things to be Whereof I'm \
speaking, nor depart away With bosom scorning these the spoken truths, \
Thyself at fault unable to perceive. Sleep chiefly comes when energy of soul \
Hath now been scattered through the frame, and part Expelled abroad and gone \
away, and part Crammed back and settling deep within the frame- Whereafter \
then our loosened members droop. For doubt is none that by the work of soul \
Exist in us this sense, and when by slumber That sense is thwarted, we are \
bound to think The soul confounded and expelled abroad- Yet not entirely, \
else the frame would lie Drenched in the everlasting cold of death. In sooth, \
where no one part of soul remained Lurking among the members, even as fire \
Lurks buried under many ashes, whence Could sense amain rekindled be in \
members, As flame can rise anew from unseen fire? By what devices this \
strange state and new May be occasioned, and by what the soul Can be \
confounded and the frame grow faint, I will untangle: see to it, thou, that I \
Pour forth my words not unto empty winds. In first place, body on its outer \
parts- Since these are touched by neighbouring aery gusts- Must there be \
thumped and strook by blows of air Repeatedly. And therefore almost all Are \
covered either with hides, or else with shells, Or with the horny callus, or \
with bark. Yet this same air lashes their inner parts, When creatures draw a \
breath or blow it out. Wherefore, since body thus is flogged alike Upon the \
inside and the out, and blows Come in upon us through the little pores Even \
inward to our body's primal parts And primal elements, there comes to pass By \
slow degrees, along our members then, A kind of overthrow; for then \
confounded Are those arrangements of the primal germs Of body and of mind. It \
comes to pass That next a part of soul's expelled abroad, A part retreateth \
in recesses hid, A part, too, scattered all about the frame, Cannot become \
united nor engage In interchange of motion. Nature now So hedges off \
approaches and the paths; And thus the sense, its motions all deranged, \
Retires down deep within; and since there's naught, As 'twere, to prop the \
frame, the body weakens, And all the members languish, and the arms And \
eyelids fall, and, as ye lie abed, Even there the houghs will sag and loose \
their powers. Again, sleep follows after food, because The food produces same \
result as air, Whilst being scattered round through all the veins; And much \
the heaviest is that slumber which, Full or fatigued, thou takest; since 'tis \
then That the most bodies disarrange themselves, Bruised by labours hard. And \
in same wise, This three-fold change: a forcing of the soul Down deeper, more \
a casting-forth of it, A moving more divided in its parts And scattered more. \
And to whate'er pursuit A man most clings absorbed, or what the affairs On \
which we theretofore have tarried much, And mind hath strained upon the more, \
we seem In sleep not rarely to go at the same. The lawyers seem to plead and \
cite decrees, Commanders they to fight and go at frays, Sailors to live in \
combat with the winds, And we ourselves indeed to make this book, And still \
to seek the nature of the world And set it down, when once discovered, here \
In these my country's leaves. Thus all pursuits, All arts in general seem in \
sleeps to mock And master the minds of men. And whosoever Day after day for \
long to games have given Attention undivided, still they keep (As oft we \
note), even when they've ceased to grasp Those games with their own senses, \
open paths Within the mind wherethrough the idol-films Of just those games \
can come. And thus it is For many a day thereafter those appear Floating \
before the eyes, that even awake They think they view the dancers moving \
round Their supple limbs, and catch with both the ears The liquid song of \
harp and speaking chords, And view the same assembly on the seats, And \
manifold bright glories of the stage- So great the influence of pursuit and \
zest, And of the affairs wherein 'thas been the wont Of men to be engaged-nor \
only men, But soothly all the animals. Behold, Thou'lt see the sturdy horses, \
though outstretched, Yet sweating in their sleep, and panting ever, And \
straining utmost strength, as if for prize, As if, with barriers opened \
now... And hounds of huntsmen oft in soft repose Yet toss asudden all their \
legs about, And growl and bark, and with their nostrils sniff The winds \
again, again, as though indeed They'd caught the scented foot-prints of wild \
beasts, And, even when wakened, often they pursue The phantom images of \
stags, as though They did perceive them fleeing on before, Until the \
illusion's shaken off and dogs Come to themselves again. And fawning breed Of \
house-bred whelps do feel the sudden urge To shake their bodies and start \
from off the ground, As if beholding stranger-visages. And ever the fiercer \
be the stock, the more In sleep the same is ever bound to rage. But flee the \
divers tribes of birds and vex With sudden wings by night the groves of gods, \
When in their gentle slumbers they have dreamed Of hawks in chase, aswooping \
on for fight. Again, the minds of mortals which perform With mighty motions \
mighty enterprises, Often in sleep will do and dare the same In manner like. \
Kings take the towns by storm, Succumb to capture, battle on the field, Raise \
a wild cry as if their throats were cut Even then and there. And many wrestle \
on And groan with pains, and fill all regions round With mighty cries and \
wild, as if then gnawed By fangs of panther or of lion fierce. Many amid \
their slumbers talk about Their mighty enterprises, and have often Enough \
become the proof of their own crimes. Many meet death; many, as if headlong \
From lofty mountains tumbling down to earth With all their frame, are \
frenzied in their fright; And after sleep, as if still mad in mind, They \
scarce come to, confounded as they are By ferment of their frame. The thirsty \
man, Likewise, he sits beside delightful spring Or river and gulpeth down \
with gaping throat Nigh the whole stream. And oft the innocent young, By \
sleep o'ermastered, think they lift their dress By pail or public jordan and \
then void The water filtered down their frame entire And drench the \
Babylonian coverlets, Magnificently bright. Again, those males Into the \
surging channels of whose years Now first has passed the seed (engendered \
Within their members by the ripened days) Are in their sleep confronted from \
without By idol-images of some fair form- Tidings of glorious face and lovely \
bloom, Which stir and goad the regions turgid now With seed abundant; so \
that, as it were With all the matter acted duly out, They pour the billows of \
a potent stream And stain their garment. And as said before, That seed is \
roused in us when once ripe age Has made our body strong... As divers causes \
give to divers things Impulse and irritation, so one force In human kind \
rouses the human seed To spurt from man. As soon as ever it issues, Forced \
from its first abodes, it passes down In the whole body through the limbs and \
frame, Meeting in certain regions of our thews, And stirs amain the genitals \
of man. The goaded regions swell with seed, and then Comes the delight to \
dart the same at what The mad desire so yearns, and body seeks That object, \
whence the mind by love is pierced. For well-nigh each man falleth toward his \
wound, And our blood spurts even toward the spot from whence The stroke \
wherewith we are strook, and if indeed The foe be close, the red jet reaches \
him. Thus, one who gets a stroke from Venus' shafts- Whether a boy with limbs \
effeminate Assault him, or a woman darting love From all her body- that one \
strains to get Even to the thing whereby he's hit, and longs To join with it \
and cast into its frame The fluid drawn even from within its own. For the \
mute craving doth presage delight. THE PASSION OF LOVE This craving 'tis \
that's Venus unto us: From this, engender all the lures of love, From this, O \
first hath into human hearts Trickled that drop of joyance which ere long Is \
by chill care succeeded. Since, indeed, Though she thou lovest now be far \
away, Yet idol-images of her are near And the sweet name is floating in thy \
ear. But it behooves to flee those images; And scare afar whatever feeds thy \
love; And turn elsewhere thy mind; and vent the sperm, Within thee gathered, \
into sundry bodies, Nor, with thy thoughts still busied with one love, Keep \
it for one delight, and so store up Care for thyself and pain inevitable. \
For, lo, the ulcer just by nourishing Grows to more life with deep \
inveteracy, And day by day the fury swells aflame, And the woe waxes heavier \
day by day- Unless thou dost destroy even by new blows The former wounds of \
love, and curest them While yet they're fresh, by wandering freely round \
After the freely-wandering Venus, or Canst lead elsewhere the tumults of thy \
mind. Nor doth that man who keeps away from love Yet lack the fruits of \
Venus; rather takes Those pleasures which are free of penalties. For the \
delights of Venus, verily, Are more unmixed for mortals sane-of-soul Than for \
those sick-at-heart with love-pining. Yea, in the very moment of possessing, \
Surges the heat of lovers to and fro, Restive, uncertain; and they cannot fix \
On what to first enjoy with eyes and hands. The parts they sought for, those \
they squeeze so tight, And pain the creature's body, close their teeth Often \
against her lips, and smite with kiss Mouth into mouth,- because this same \
delight Is not unmixed; and underneath are stings Which goad a man to hurt \
the very thing, Whate'er it be, from whence arise for him Those germs of \
madness. But with gentle touch Venus subdues the pangs in midst of love, And \
the admixture of a fondling joy Doth curb the bites of passion. For they hope \
That by the very body whence they caught The heats of love their flames can \
be put out. But nature protests 'tis all quite otherwise; For this same love \
it is the one sole thing Of which, the more we have, the fiercer burns The \
breast with fell desire. For food and drink Are taken within our members; \
and, since they Can stop up certain parts, thus, easily Desire of water is \
glutted and of bread. But, lo, from human face and lovely bloom Naught \
penetrates our frame to be enjoyed Save flimsy idol-images and vain- A sorry \
hope which oft the winds disperse. As when the thirsty man in slumber seeks \
To drink, and water ne'er is granted him Wherewith to quench the heat within \
his members, But after idols of the liquids strives And toils in vain, and \
thirsts even whilst he gulps In middle of the torrent, thus in love Venus \
deludes with idol-images The lovers. Nor they cannot sate their lust By \
merely gazing on the bodies, nor They cannot with their palms and fingers rub \
Aught from each tender limb, the while they stray Uncertain over all the \
body. Then, At last, with members intertwined, when they Enjoy the flower of \
their age, when now Their bodies have sweet presage of keen joys, And Venus \
is about to sow the fields Of woman, greedily their frames they lock, And \
mingle the slaver of their mouths, and breathe Into each other, pressing \
teeth on mouths- Yet to no purpose, since they're powerless To rub off aught, \
or penetrate and pass With body entire into body- for oft They seem to strive \
and struggle thus to do; So eagerly they cling in Venus' bonds, Whilst melt \
away their members, overcome By violence of delight. But when at last Lust, \
gathered in the thews, hath spent itself, There come a brief pause in the \
raging heat- But then a madness just the same returns And that old fury \
visits them again, When once again they seek and crave to reach They know not \
what, all powerless to find The artifice to subjugate the bane. In such \
uncertain state they waste away With unseen wound. To which be added too, \
They squander powers and with the travail wane; Be added too, they spend \
their futile years Under another's beck and call; their duties Neglected \
languish and their honest name Reeleth sick, sick; and meantime their estates \
Are lost in Babylonian tapestries; And unguents and dainty Sicyonian shoes \
Laugh on her feet; and (as ye may be sure) Big emeralds of green light are \
set in gold; And rich sea-purple dress by constant wear Grows shabby and all \
soaked with Venus' sweat; And the well-earned ancestral property Becometh \
head-bands, coifs, and many a time The cloaks, or garments Alidensian Or of \
the Cean isle. And banquets, set With rarest cloth and viands, are prepared- \
And games of chance, and many a drinking cup, And unguents, crowns and \
garlands. All in vain, Since from amid the well-spring of delights Bubbles \
some drop of bitter to torment Among the very flowers- when haply mind Gnaws \
into self, now stricken with remorse For slothful years and ruin in baudels, \
Or else because she's left him all in doubt By launching some sly word, which \
still like fire Lives wildly, cleaving to his eager heart; Or else because he \
thinks she darts her eyes Too much about and gazes at another,- And in her \
face sees traces of a laugh. These ills are found in prospering love and \
true; But in crossed love and helpless there be such As through shut eyelids \
thou canst still take in- Uncounted ills; so that 'tis better far To watch \
beforehand, in the way I've shown, And guard against enticements. For to shun \
A fall into the hunting-snares of love Is not so hard, as to get out again, \
When tangled in the very nets, and burst The stoutly-knotted cords of \
Aphrodite. Yet even when there enmeshed with tangled feet, Still canst thou \
scape the danger-lest indeed Thou standest in the way of thine own good, And \
overlookest first all blemishes Of mind and body of thy much preferred, \
Desirable dame. For so men do, Eyeless with passion, and assign to them \
Graces not theirs in fact. And thus we see Creatures in many a wise crooked \
and ugly The prosperous sweethearts in a high esteem; And lovers gird each \
other and advise To placate Venus, since their friends are smit With a base \
passion- miserable dupes Who seldom mark their own worst bane of all. The \
black-skinned girl is \"tawny like the honey\"; The filthy and the fetid's \
\"negligee\"; The cat-eyed she's \"a little Pallas,\" she; The sinewy and \
wizened's \"a gazelle\"; The pudgy and the pigmy is \"piquant, One of the \
Graces sure\"; the big and bulky O she's \"an Admiration, imposante\"; The \
stuttering and tongue-tied \"sweetly lisps\"; The mute girl's \"modest\"; and \
the garrulous, The spiteful spit-fire, is \"a sparkling wit\"; And she who \
scarcely lives for scrawniness Becomes \"a slender darling\"; \"delicate\" Is \
she who's nearly dead of coughing-fit; The pursy female with protuberant \
breasts She is \"like Ceres when the goddess gave Young Bacchus suck\"; the \
pug-nosed lady-love \"A Satyress, a feminine Silenus\"; The blubber-lipped is \
\"all one luscious kiss\"- A weary while it were to tell the whole. But let \
her face possess what charm ye will, Let Venus' glory rise from all her \
limbs,- Forsooth there still are others; and forsooth We lived before without \
her; and forsooth She does the same things- and we know she does- All, as the \
ugly creature, and she scents, Yes she, her wretched self with vile perfumes; \
Whom even her handmaids flee and giggle at Behind her back. But he, the \
lover, in tears Because shut out, covers her threshold o'er Often with \
flowers and garlands, and anoints Her haughty door-posts with the marjoram, \
And prints, poor fellow, kisses on the doors- Admitted at last, if haply but \
one whiff Got to him on approaching, he would seek Decent excuses to go out \
forthwith; And his lament, long pondered, then would fall Down at his heels; \
and there he'd damn himself For his fatuity, observing how He had assigned to \
that same lady more- Than it is proper to concede to mortals. And these our \
Venuses are 'ware of this. Wherefore the more are they at pains to hide All \
the-behind-the-scenes of life from those Whom they desire to keep in bonds of \
love- In vain, since ne'ertheless thou canst by thought Drag all the matter \
forth into the light And well search out the cause of all these smiles; And \
if of graceful mind she be and kind, Do thou, in thy turn, overlook the same, \
And thus allow for poor mortality. Nor sighs the woman always with feigned \
love, Who links her body round man's body locked And holds him fast, making \
his kisses wet With lips sucked into lips; for oft she acts Even from desire, \
and, seeking mutual joys, Incites him there to run love's race-course \
through. Nor otherwise can cattle, birds, wild beasts, And sheep and mares \
submit unto the males, Except that their own nature is in heat, And burns \
abounding and with gladness takes Once more the Venus of the mounting males. \
And seest thou not how those whom mutual pleasure Hath bound are tortured in \
their common bonds? How often in the cross-roads dogs that pant To get apart \
strain eagerly asunder With utmost might?- When all the while they're fast In \
the stout links of Venus. But they'd ne'er So pull, except they knew those \
mutual joys- So powerful to cast them unto snares And hold them bound. \
Wherefore again, again, Even as I say, there is a joint delight. And when \
perchance, in mingling seed with his, The female hath o'erpowered the force \
of male And by a sudden fling hath seized it fast, Then are the offspring, \
more from mothers' seed, More like their mothers; as, from fathers' seed, \
They're like to fathers. But whom seest to be Partakers of each shape, one \
equal blend Of parents' features, these are generate From fathers' body and \
from mothers' blood, When mutual and harmonious heat hath dashed Together \
seeds, aroused along their frames By Venus' goads, and neither of the twain \
Mastereth or is mastered. Happens too That sometimes offspring can to being \
come In likeness of their grandsires, and bring back Often the shapes of \
grandsires' sires, because Their parents in their bodies oft retain Concealed \
many primal germs, commixed In many modes, which, starting with the stock, \
Sire handeth down to son, himself a sire; Whence Venus by a variable chance \
Engenders shapes, and diversely brings back Ancestral features, voices too, \
and hair. A female generation rises forth From seed paternal, and from \
mother's body Exist created males: since sex proceeds No more from singleness \
of seed than faces Or bodies or limbs of ours: for every birth Is from a \
twofold seed; and what's created Hath, of that parent which it is more like, \
More than its equal share; as thou canst mark,- Whether the breed be male or \
female stock. Nor do the powers divine grudge any man The fruits of his \
seed-sowing, so that never He be called \"father\" by sweet children his, And \
end his days in sterile love forever. What many men suppose; and gloomily \
They sprinkle the altars with abundant blood, And make the high platforms \
odorous with burnt gifts, To render big by plenteous seed their wives- And \
plague in vain godheads and sacred lots. For sterile are these men by seed \
too thick, Or else by far too watery and thin. Because the thin is powerless \
to cleave Fast to the proper places, straightaway It trickles from them, and, \
returned again, Retires abortively. And then since seed More gross and solid \
than will suit is spent By some men, either it flies not forth amain With \
spurt prolonged enough, or else it fails To enter suitably the proper places, \
Or, having entered, the seed is weakly mixed With seed of the woman: \
harmonies of Venus Are seen to matter vastly here; and some Impregnate some \
more readily, and from some Some women conceive more readily and become \
Pregnant. And many women, sterile before In several marriage-beds, have yet \
thereafter Obtained the mates from whom they could conceive The baby-boys, \
and with sweet progeny Grow rich. And even for husbands (whose own wives, \
Although of fertile wombs, have borne for them No babies in the house) are \
also found Concordant natures so that they at last Can bulwark their old age \
with goodly sons. A matter of great moment 'tis in truth, That seeds may \
mingle readily with seeds Suited for procreation, and that thick Should mix \
with fluid seeds, with thick the fluid. And in this business 'tis of some \
import Upon what diet life is nourished: For some foods thicken seeds within \
our members, And others thin them out and waste away. And in what modes the \
fond delight itself Is carried on- this too importeth vastly. For commonly \
'tis thought that wives conceive More readily in manner of wild-beasts, After \
the custom of the four-foot breeds, Because so postured, with the breasts \
beneath And buttocks then upreared, the seeds can take Their proper places. \
Nor is need the least For wives to use the motions of blandishment; For thus \
the woman hinders and resists Her own conception, if too joyously Herself she \
treats the Venus of the man With haunches heaving, and with all her bosom Now \
yielding like the billows of the sea- Aye, from the ploughshare's even course \
and track She throws the furrow, and from proper places Deflects the spurt of \
seed. And courtesans Are thuswise wont to move for their own ends, To keep \
from pregnancy and lying in, And all the while to render Venus more A \
pleasure for the men- the which meseems Our wives have never need of. \
Sometimes too It happens- and through no divinity Nor arrows of Venus- that a \
sorry chit Of scanty grace will be beloved by man; For sometimes she herself \
by very deeds, By her complying ways, and tidy habits, Will easily accustom \
thee to pass With her thy life-time- and, moreover, lo, Long habitude can \
gender human love, Even as an object smitten o'er and o'er By blows, however \
lightly, yet at last Is overcome and wavers. Seest thou not, Besides, how \
drops of water falling down Against the stones at last bore through the \
stones? BOOK V PROEM O WHO can build with puissant breast a song Worthy the \
majesty of these great finds? Or who in words so strong that he can frame The \
fit laudations for deserts of him Who left us heritors of such vast prizes, \
By his own breast discovered and sought out?- There shall be none, methinks, \
of mortal stock. For if must needs be named for him the name Demanded by the \
now known majesty Of these high matters, then a god was he,- Hear me, \
illustrious Memmius- a god; Who first and chief found out that plan of life \
Which now is called philosophy, and who By cunning craft, out of such mighty \
waves, Out of such mighty darkness, moored life In havens so serene, in light \
so clear. Compare those old discoveries divine Of others: lo, according to \
the tale, Ceres established for mortality The grain, and Bacchus juice of \
vine-born grape, Though life might yet without these things abide, Even as \
report saith now some peoples live. But man's well-being was impossible \
Without a breast all free. Wherefore the more That man doth justly seem to us \
a god, From whom sweet solaces of life, afar Distributed o'er populous \
domains, Now soothe the minds of men. But if thou thinkest Labours of \
Hercules excel the same, Much farther from true reasoning thou farest. For \
what could hurt us now that mighty maw Of Nemeaean Lion, or what the Boar Who \
bristled in Arcadia? Or, again, O what could Cretan Bull, or Hydra, pest Of \
Lerna, fenced with vipers venomous? Or what the triple-breasted power of her \
The three-fold Geryon... The sojourners in the Stymphalian fens So dreadfully \
offend us, or the Steeds Of Thracian Diomedes breathing fire From out their \
nostrils off along the zones Bistonian and Ismarian? And the Snake, The dread \
fierce gazer, guardian of the golden And gleaming apples of the Hesperides, \
Coiled round the tree-trunk with tremendous bulk, O what, again, could he \
inflict on us Along the Atlantic shore and wastes of sea?- Where neither one \
of us approacheth nigh Nor no barbarian ventures. And the rest Of all those \
monsters slain, even if alive, Unconquered still, what injury could they do? \
None, as I guess. For so the glutted earth Swarms even now with savage \
beasts, even now Is filled with anxious terrors through the woods And mighty \
mountains and the forest deeps- Quarters 'tis ours in general to avoid. But \
lest the breast be purged, what conflicts then, What perils, must bosom, in \
our own despite! O then how great and keen the cares of lust That split the \
man distraught! How great the fears! And lo, the pride, grim greed, and \
wantonness- How great the slaughters in their train! and lo, Debaucheries and \
every breed of sloth! Therefore that man who subjugated these, And from the \
mind expelled, by words indeed, Not arms, O shall it not be seemly him To \
dignify by ranking with the gods?- And all the more since he was wont to \
give, Concerning the immortal gods themselves, Many pronouncements with a \
tongue divine, And to unfold by his pronouncements all The nature of the \
world. ARGUMENT OF THE BOOK AND NEW PROEM AGAINST A TELEOLOGICAL CONCEPT And \
walking now In his own footprints, I do follow through His reasonings, and \
with pronouncements teach The covenant whereby all things are framed, How \
under that covenant they must abide Nor ever prevail to abrogate the aeons' \
Inexorable decrees,- how (as we've found), In class of mortal objects, o'er \
all else, The mind exists of earth-born frame create And impotent unscathed \
to abide Across the mighty aeons, and how come In sleep those \
idol-apparitions, That so befool intelligence when we Do seem to view a man \
whom life has left. Thus far we've gone; the order of my plan Hath brought me \
now unto the point where I Must make report how, too, the universe Consists \
of mortal body, born in time, And in what modes that congregated stuff \
Established itself as earth and sky, Ocean, and stars, and sun, and ball of \
moon; And then what living creatures rose from out The old telluric places, \
and what ones Were never born at all; and in what mode The human race began \
to name its things And use the varied speech from man to man; And in what \
modes hath bosomed in their breasts That awe of gods, which halloweth in all \
lands Fanes, altars, groves, lakes, idols of the gods. Also I shall untangle \
by what power The steersman nature guides the sun's courses, And the \
meanderings of the moon, lest we, Percase, should fancy that of own free will \
They circle their perennial courses round, Timing their motions for increase \
of crops And living creatures, or lest we should think They roll along by any \
plan of gods. For even those men who have learned full well That godheads \
lead a long life free of care, If yet meanwhile they wonder by what plan \
Things can go on (and chiefly yon high things Observed o'erhead on the \
ethereal coasts), Again are hurried back unto the fears Of old religion and \
adopt again Harsh masters, deemed almighty,- wretched men, Unwitting what can \
be and what cannot, And by what law to each its scope prescribed, Its \
boundary stone that clings so deep in Time. But for the rest,- lest we delay \
thee here Longer by empty promises- behold, Before all else, the seas, the \
lands, the sky: O Memmius, their threefold nature, lo, Their bodies three, \
three aspects so unlike, Three frames so vast, a single day shall give Unto \
annihilation! Then shall crash That massive form and fabric of the world \
Sustained so many aeons! Nor do I Fail to perceive how strange and marvellous \
This fact must strike the intellect of man,- Annihilation of the sky and \
earth That is to be,- and with what toil of words 'Tis mine to prove the \
same; as happens oft When once ye offer to man's listening ears Something \
before unheard of, but may not Subject it to the view of eyes for him Nor put \
it into hand- the sight and touch, Whereby the opened highways of belief Lead \
most directly into human breast And regions of intelligence. But yet I will \
speak out. The fact itself, perchance, Will force belief in these my words, \
and thou Mayst see, in little time, tremendously With risen commotions of the \
lands all things Quaking to pieces- which afar from us May she, the steersman \
Nature, guide: and may Reason, O rather than the fact itself, Persuade us \
that all things can be o'erthrown And sink with awful-sounding breakage down! \
But ere on this I take a step to utter Oracles holier and soundlier based \
Than ever the Pythian pronounced for men From out the tripod and the Delphian \
laurel, I will unfold for thee with learned words Many a consolation, lest \
perchance, Still bridled by religion, thou suppose Lands, sun, and sky, sea, \
constellations, moon, Must dure forever, as of frame divine- And so conclude \
that it is just that those, (After the manner of the Giants), should all Pay \
the huge penalties for monstrous crime, Who by their reasonings do overshake \
The ramparts of the universe and wish There to put out the splendid sun of \
heaven, Branding with mortal talk immortal things- Though these same things \
are even so far removed From any touch of deity and seem So far unworthy of \
numbering with the gods, That well they may be thought to furnish rather A \
goodly instance of the sort of things That lack the living motion, living \
sense. For sure 'tis quite beside the mark to think That judgment and the \
nature of the mind In any kind of body can exist- Just as in ether can't \
exist a tree, Nor clouds in the salt sea, nor in the fields Can fishes live, \
nor blood in timber be, Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged Where \
everything may grow and have its place. Thus nature of mind cannot arise \
alone Without the body, nor have its being far From thews and blood. Yet if \
'twere possible?- Much rather might this very power of mind Be in the head, \
the shoulders, or the heels, And, born in any part soever, yet In the same \
man, in the same vessel abide But since within this body even of ours Stands \
fixed and appears arranged sure Where soul and mind can each exist and grow, \
Deny we must the more that they can dure Outside the body and the breathing \
form In rotting clods of earth, in the sun's fire, In water, or in ether's \
skiey coasts. Therefore these things no whit are furnished With sense divine, \
since never can they be With life-force quickened. Likewise, thou canst ne'er \
Believe the sacred seats of gods are here In any regions of this mundane \
world; Indeed, the nature of the gods, so subtle, So far removed from these \
our senses, scarce Is seen even by intelligence of mind. And since they've \
ever eluded touch and thrust Of human hands, they cannot reach to grasp Aught \
tangible to us. For what may not Itself be touched in turn can never touch. \
Wherefore, besides, also their seats must be Unlike these seats of ours,- \
even subtle too, As meet for subtle essence- as I'll prove Hereafter unto \
thee with large discourse. Further, to say that for the sake of men They \
willed to prepare this world's magnificence, And that 'tis therefore duty and \
behoof To praise the work of gods as worthy praise, And that 'tis sacrilege \
for men to shake Ever by any force from out their seats What hath been \
stablished by the Forethought old To everlasting for races of mankind, And \
that 'tis sacrilege to assault by words And overtopple all from base to \
beam,- Memmius, such notions to concoct and pile, Is verily- to dote. Our \
gratefulness, O what emoluments could it confer Upon Immortals and upon the \
Blessed That they should take a step to manage aught For sake of us? Or what \
new factor could, After so long a time, inveigle them- The hitherto \
reposeful- to desire To change their former life? For rather he Whom old \
things chafe seems likely to rejoice At new; but one that in fore-passed time \
Hath chanced upon no ill, through goodly years, O what could ever enkindle in \
such an one Passion for strange experiment? Or what The evil for us, if we \
had ne'er been born?- As though, forsooth, in darkling realms and woe Our \
life were lying till should dawn at last The day-spring of creation! \
Whosoever Hath been begotten wills perforce to stay In life, so long as fond \
delight detains; But whoso ne'er hath tasted love of life, And ne'er was in \
the count of living things, What hurts it him that he was never born? Whence, \
further, first was planted in the gods The archetype for gendering the world \
And the fore-notion of what man is like, So that they knew and pre-conceived \
with mind Just what they wished to make? Or how were known Ever the energies \
of primal germs, And what those germs, by interchange of place, Could thus \
produce, if nature's self had not Given example for creating all? For in such \
wise primordials of things, Many in many modes, astir by blows From \
immemorial aeons, in motion too By their own weights, have evermore been wont \
To be so borne along and in all modes To meet together and to try all sorts \
Which, by combining one with other, they Are powerful to create, that thus it \
is No marvel now, if they have also fallen Into arrangements such, and if \
they've passed Into vibrations such, as those whereby This sum of things is \
carried on to-day By fixed renewal. But knew I never what The seeds \
primordial were, yet would I dare This to affirm, even from deep judgments \
based Upon the ways and conduct of the skies- This to maintain by many a fact \
besides- That in no wise the nature of all things For us was fashioned by a \
power divine- So great the faults it stands encumbered with. First, mark all \
regions which are overarched By the prodigious reaches of the sky: One \
yawning part thereof the mountain-chains And forests of the beasts do have \
and hold; And cliffs, and desert fens, and wastes of sea (Which sunder afar \
the beaches of the lands) Possess it merely; and, again, thereof Well-nigh \
two-thirds intolerable heat And a perpetual fall of frost doth rob From \
mortal kind. And what is left to till, Even that the force of nature would \
o'errun With brambles, did not human force oppose,- Long wont for livelihood \
to groan and sweat Over the two-pronged mattock and to cleave The soil in \
twain by pressing on the plough. Unless, by the ploughshare turning the \
fruitful clods And kneading the mould, we quicken into birth, [The crops] \
spontaneously could not come up Into the free bright air. Even then \
sometimes, When things acquired by the sternest toil Are now in leaf, are now \
in blossom all, Either the skiey sun with baneful heats Parches, or sudden \
rains or chilling rime Destroys, or flaws of winds with furious whirl Torment \
and twist. Beside these matters, why Doth nature feed and foster on land and \
sea The dreadful breed of savage beasts, the foes Of the human clan? Why do \
the seasons bring Distempers with them? Wherefore stalks at large Death, so \
untimely? Then, again, the babe, Like to the castaway of the raging surf, \
Lies naked on the ground, speechless, in want Of every help for life, when \
nature first Hath poured him forth upon the shores of light With birth-pangs \
from within the mother's womb, And with a plaintive wail he fills the place,- \
As well befitting one for whom remains In life a journey through so many \
ills. But all the flocks and herds and all wild beasts Come forth and grow, \
nor need the little rattles, Nor must be treated to the humouring nurse's \
Dear, broken chatter; nor seek they divers clothes To suit the changing \
skies; nor need, in fine, Nor arms, nor lofty ramparts, wherewithal Their own \
to guard- because the earth herself And nature, artificer of the world, bring \
forth Aboundingly all things for all. THE WORLD IS NOT ETERNAL And first, \
Since body of earth and water, air's light breath, And fiery exhalations (of \
which four This sum of things is seen to be compact) So all have birth and \
perishable frame, Thus the whole nature of the world itself Must be conceived \
as perishable too. For, verily, those things of which we see The parts and \
members to have birth in time And perishable shapes, those same we mark To be \
invariably born in time And born to die. And therefore when I see The \
mightiest members and the parts of this Our world consumed and begot again, \
'Tis mine to know that also sky above And earth beneath began of old in time \
And shall in time go under to disaster. And lest in these affairs thou \
deemest me To have seized upon this point by sleight to serve My own caprice- \
because I have assumed That earth and fire are mortal things indeed, And have \
not doubted water and the air Both perish too and have affirmed the same To \
be again begotten and wax big- Mark well the argument: in first place, lo, \
Some certain parts of earth, grievously parched By unremitting suns, and \
trampled on By a vast throng of feet, exhale abroad A powdery haze and flying \
clouds of dust, Which the stout winds disperse in the whole air. A part, \
moreover, of her sod and soil Is summoned to inundation by the rains; And \
rivers graze and gouge the banks away. Besides, whatever takes a part its own \
In fostering and increasing [aught]... Is rendered back; and since, beyond a \
doubt, Earth, the all-mother, is beheld to be Likewise the common sepulchre \
of things, Therefore thou seest her minished of her plenty, And then again \
augmented with new growth. And for the rest, that sea, and streams, and \
springs Forever with new waters overflow, And that perennially the fluids \
well, Needeth no words- the mighty flux itself Of multitudinous waters round \
about Declareth this. But whatso water first Streams up is ever straightway \
carried off, And thus it comes to pass that all in all There is no overflow; \
in part because The burly winds (that over-sweep amain) And skiey sun (that \
with his rays dissolves) Do minish the level seas; in part because The water \
is diffused underground Through all the lands. The brine is filtered off, And \
then the liquid stuff seeps back again And all regathers at the river-heads, \
Whence in fresh-water currents on it flows Over the lands, adown the channels \
which Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along The liquid-footed floods. \
Now, then, of air I'll speak, which hour by hour in all its body Is changed \
innumerably. For whatso'er Streams up in dust or vapour off of things, The \
same is all and always borne along Into the mighty ocean of the air; And did \
not air in turn restore to things Bodies, and thus recruit them as they \
stream, All things by this time had resolved been And changed into air. \
Therefore it never Ceases to be engendered off of things And to return to \
things, since verily In constant flux do all things stream. Likewise, The \
abounding well-spring of the liquid light, The ethereal sun, doth flood the \
heaven o'er With constant flux of radiance ever new, And with fresh light \
supplies the place of light, Upon the instant. For whatever effulgence Hath \
first streamed off, no matter where it falls, Is lost unto the sun. And this \
'tis thine To know from these examples: soon as clouds Have first begun to \
under-pass the sun, And, as it were, to rend the rays of light In twain, at \
once the lower part of them Is lost entire, and earth is overcast Where'er \
the thunderheads are rolled along- So know thou mayst that things forever \
need A fresh replenishment of gleam and glow, And each effulgence, foremost \
flashed forth, Perisheth one by one. Nor otherwise Can things be seen in \
sunlight, lest alway The fountain-head of light supply new light. Indeed your \
earthly beacons of the night, The hanging lampions and the torches, bright \
With darting gleams and dense with livid soot, Do hurry in like manner to \
supply With ministering heat new light amain; Are all alive to quiver with \
their fires,- Are so alive, that thus the light ne'er leaves The spots it \
shines on, as if rent in twain: So speedily is its destruction veiled By the \
swift birth of flame from all the fires. Thus, then, we must suppose that sun \
and moon And stars dart forth their light from under-births Ever and ever \
new, and whatso flames First rise do perish always one by one- Lest, haply, \
thou shouldst think they each endure Inviolable. Again, perceivest not How \
stones are also conquered by Time?- Not how the lofty towers ruin down, And \
boulders crumble?- Not how shrines of gods And idols crack outworn?- Nor how \
indeed The holy Influence hath yet no power There to postpone the Terminals \
of Fate, Or headway make 'gainst Nature's fixed decrees? Again, behold we not \
the monuments Of heroes, now in ruins, asking us, In their turn likewise, if \
we don't believe They also age with eld? Behold we not The rended basalt \
ruining amain Down from the lofty mountains, powerless To dure and dree the \
mighty forces there Of finite time?- for they would never fall Rended \
asudden, if from infinite Past They had prevailed against all engin'ries Of \
the assaulting aeons, with no crash. Again, now look at This, which round, \
above, Contains the whole earth in its one embrace: If from itself it \
procreates all things- As some men tell- and takes them to itself When once \
destroyed, entirely must it be Of mortal birth and body; for whate'er From \
out itself giveth to other things Increase and food, the same perforce must \
be Minished, and then recruited when it takes Things back into itself. \
Besides all this, If there had been no origin-in-birth Of lands and sky, and \
they had ever been The everlasting, why, ere Theban war And obsequies of \
Troy, have other bards Not also chanted other high affairs? Whither have sunk \
so oft so many deeds Of heroes? Why do those deeds live no more, Ingrafted in \
eternal monuments Of glory? Verily, I guess, because The Sum is new, and of a \
recent date The nature of our universe, and had Not long ago its own \
exordium. Wherefore, even now some arts are being still Refined, still \
increased: now unto ships Is being added many a new device; And but the other \
day musician-folk Gave birth to melic sounds of organing; And, then, this \
nature, this account of things Hath been discovered latterly, and I Myself \
have been discovered only now, As first among the first, able to turn The \
same into ancestral Roman speech. Yet if, percase, thou deemest that ere this \
Existed all things even the same, but that Perished the cycles of the human \
race In fiery exhalations, or cities fell By some tremendous quaking of the \
world, Or rivers in fury, after constant rains, Had plunged forth across the \
lands of earth And whelmed the towns- then, all the more must thou Confess, \
defeated by the argument, That there shall be annihilation too Of lands and \
sky. For at a time when things Were being taxed by maladies so great, And so \
great perils, if some cause more fell Had then assailed them, far and wide \
they would Have gone to disaster and supreme collapse. And by no other \
reasoning are we Seen to be mortal, save that all of us Sicken in turn with \
those same maladies With which have sickened in the past those men Whom \
nature hath removed from life. Again, Whatever abides eternal must indeed \
Either repel all strokes, because 'tis made Of solid body, and permit no \
entrance Of aught with power to sunder from within The parts compact- as are \
those seeds of stuff Whose nature we've exhibited before; Or else be able to \
endure through time For this: because they are from blows exempt, As is the \
void, the which abides untouched, Unsmit by any stroke; or else because There \
is no room around, whereto things can, As 'twere, depart in dissolution all,- \
Even as the sum of sums eternal is, Without or place beyond whereto things \
may Asunder fly, or bodies which can smite, And thus dissolve them by the \
blows of might. But not of solid body, as I've shown, Exists the nature of \
the world, because In things is intermingled there a void; Nor is the world \
yet as the void, nor are, Moreover, bodies lacking which, percase, Rising \
from out the infinite, can fell With fury-whirlwinds all this sum of things, \
Or bring upon them other cataclysm Of peril strange; and yonder, too, abides \
The infinite space and the profound abyss- Whereinto, lo, the ramparts of the \
world Can yet be shivered. Or some other power Can pound upon them till they \
perish all. Thus is the door of doom, O nowise barred Against the sky, \
against the sun and earth And deep-sea waters, but wide open stands And \
gloats upon them, monstrous and agape. Wherefore, again, 'tis needful to \
confess That these same things are born in time; for things Which are of \
mortal body could indeed Never from infinite past until to-day Have spurned \
the multitudinous assaults Of the immeasurable aeons old. Again, since battle \
so fiercely one with other The four most mighty members the world, Aroused in \
an all unholy war, Seest not that there may be for them an end Of the long \
strife?- Or when the skiey sun And all the heat have won dominion o'er The \
sucked-up waters all?- And this they try Still to accomplish, though as yet \
they fail,- For so aboundingly the streams supply New store of waters that \
'tis rather they Who menace the world with inundations vast From forth the \
unplumbed chasms of the sea. But vain- since winds (that over-sweep amain) \
And skiey sun (that with his rays dissolves) Do minish the level seas and \
trust their power To dry up all, before the waters can Arrive at the end of \
their endeavouring. Breathing such vasty warfare, they contend In balanced \
strife the one with other still Concerning mighty issues,- though indeed The \
fire was once the more victorious, And once- as goes the tale- the water won \
A kingdom in the fields. For fire o'ermastered And licked up many things and \
burnt away, What time the impetuous horses of the Sun Snatched Phaethon \
headlong from his skiey road Down the whole ether and over all the lands. But \
the omnipotent Father in keen wrath Then with the sudden smite of thunderbolt \
Did hurl the mighty-minded hero off Those horses to the earth. And Sol, his \
sire, Meeting him as he fell, caught up in hand The ever-blazing lampion of \
the world, And drave together the pell-mell horses there And yoked them all \
a-tremble, and amain, Steering them over along their own old road, Restored \
the cosmos,- as forsooth we hear From songs of ancient poets of the Greeks- A \
tale too far away from truth, meseems. For fire can win when from the \
infinite Has risen a larger throng of particles Of fiery stuff; and then its \
powers succumb, Somehow subdued again, or else at last It shrivels in torrid \
atmospheres the world. And whilom water too began to win- As goes the story- \
when it overwhelmed The lives of men with billows; and thereafter, When all \
that force of water-stuff which forth From out the infinite had risen up Did \
now retire, as somehow turned aside, The rain-storms stopped, and streams \
their fury checked. FORMATION OF THE WORLD AND ASTRONOMICAL QUESTIONS But in \
what modes that conflux of first-stuff Did found the multitudinous universe \
Of earth, and sky, and the unfathomed deeps Of ocean, and courses of the sun \
and moon, I'll now in order tell. For of a truth Neither by counsel did the \
primal germs 'Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind, Each in its proper \
place; nor did they make, Forsooth, a compact how each germ should move; But, \
lo, because primordials of things, Many in many modes, astir by blows From \
immemorial aeons, in motion too By their own weights, have evermore been wont \
To be so borne along and in all modes To meet together and to try all sorts \
Which, by combining one with other, they Are powerful to create: because of \
this It comes to pass that those primordials, Diffused far and wide through \
mighty aeons, The while they unions try, and motions too, Of every kind, meet \
at the last amain, And so become oft the commencements fit Of mighty things- \
earth, sea, and sky, and race Of living creatures. In that long-ago The wheel \
of the sun could nowhere be discerned Flying far up with its abounding blaze, \
Nor constellations of the mighty world, Nor ocean, nor heaven, nor even earth \
nor air. Nor aught of things like unto things of ours Could then be seen- but \
only some strange storm And a prodigious hurly-burly mass Compounded of all \
kinds of primal germs, Whose battling discords in disorder kept Interstices, \
and paths, coherencies, And weights, and blows, encounterings, and motions, \
Because, by reason of their forms unlike And varied shapes, they could not \
all thuswise Remain conjoined nor harmoniously Have interplay of movements. \
But from there Portions began to fly asunder, and like With like to join, and \
to block out a world, And to divide its members and dispose Its mightier \
parts- that is, to set secure The lofty heavens from the lands, and cause The \
sea to spread with waters separate, And fires of ether separate and pure \
Likewise to congregate apart. For, lo, First came together the earthy \
particles (As being heavy and intertangled) there In the mid-region, and all \
began to take The lowest abodes; and ever the more they got One with another \
intertangled, the more They pressed from out their mass those particles Which \
were to form the sea, the stars, the sun, And moon, and ramparts of the \
mighty world- For these consist of seeds more smooth and round And of much \
smaller elements than earth. And thus it was that ether, fraught with fire, \
First broke away from out the earthen parts, Athrough the innumerable pores \
of earth, And raised itself aloft, and with itself Bore lightly off the many \
starry fires; And not far otherwise we often see And the still lakes and the \
perennial streams Exhale a mist, and even as earth herself Is seen at times \
to smoke, when first at dawn The light of the sun, the many-rayed, begins To \
redden into gold, over the grass Begemmed with dew. When all of these are \
brought Together overhead, the clouds on high With now concreted body weave a \
cover Beneath the heavens. And thuswise ether too, Light and diffusive, with \
concreted body On all sides spread, on all sides bent itself Into a dome, \
and, far and wide diffused On unto every region on all sides, Thus hedged all \
else within its greedy clasp. Hard upon ether came the origins Of sun and \
moon, whose globes revolve in air Midway between the earth and mightiest \
ether,- For neither took them, since they weighed too little To sink and \
settle, but too much to glide Along the upmost shores; and yet they are In \
such a wise midway between the twain As ever to whirl their living bodies \
round, And ever to dure as parts of the wide Whole; In the same fashion as \
certain members may In us remain at rest, whilst others move. When, then, \
these substances had been withdrawn, Amain the earth, where now extend the \
vast Cerulean zones of all the level seas, Caved in, and down along the \
hollows poured The whirlpools of her brine; and day by day The more the tides \
of ether and rays of sun On every side constrained into one mass The earth by \
lashing it again, again, Upon its outer edges (so that then, Being thus beat \
upon, 'twas all condensed About its proper centre), ever the more The salty \
sweat, from out its body squeezed, Augmented ocean and the fields of foam By \
seeping through its frame, and all the more Those many particles of heat and \
air Escaping, began to fly aloft, and form, By condensation there afar from \
earth, The high refulgent circuits of the heavens. The plains began to sink, \
and windy slopes Of the high mountains to increase; for rocks Could not \
subside, nor all the parts of ground Settle alike to one same level there. \
Thus, then, the massy weight of earth stood firm With now concreted body, \
when (as 'twere) All of the slime of the world, heavy and gross, Had run \
together and settled at the bottom, Like lees or bilge. Then ocean, then the \
air, Then ether herself, the fraught-with-fire, were all Left with their \
liquid bodies pure and free, And each more lighter than the next below; And \
ether, most light and liquid of the three, Floats on above the long aerial \
winds, Nor with the brawling of the winds of air Mingles its liquid body. It \
doth leave All there- those under-realms below her heights- There to be \
overset in whirlwinds wild,- Doth leave all there to brawl in wayward gusts, \
Whilst, gliding with a fixed impulse still, Itself it bears its fires along. \
For, lo, That ether can flow thus steadily on, on, With one unaltered urge, \
the Pontus proves- That sea which floweth forth with fixed tides, Keeping one \
onward tenor as it glides. And that the earth may there abide at rest In the \
mid-region of the world, it needs Must vanish bit by bit in weight and \
lessen, And have another substance underneath, Conjoined to it from its \
earliest age In linked unison with the vasty world's Realms of the air in \
which it roots and lives. On this account, the earth is not a load, Nor \
presses down on winds of air beneath; Even as unto a man his members be \
Without all weight- the head is not a load Unto the neck; nor do we feel the \
whole Weight of the body to centre in the feet. But whatso weights come on us \
from without, Weights laid upon us, these harass and chafe, Though often far \
lighter. For to such degree It matters always what the innate powers Of any \
given thing may be. The earth Was, then, no alien substance fetched amain, \
And from no alien firmament cast down On alien air; but was conceived, like \
air, In the first origin of this the world, As a fixed portion of the same, \
as now Our members are seen to be a part of us. Besides, the earth, when of a \
sudden shook By the big thunder, doth with her motion shake All that's above \
her- which she ne'er could do By any means, were earth not bounden fast Unto \
the great world's realms of air and sky: For they cohere together with common \
roots, Conjoined both, even from their earliest age, In linked unison. Aye, \
seest thou not That this most subtle energy of soul Supports our body, though \
so heavy a weight,- Because, indeed, 'tis with it so conjoined In linked \
unison? What power, in sum, Can raise with agile leap our body aloft, Save \
energy of mind which steers the limbs? Now seest thou not how powerful may be \
A subtle nature, when conjoined it is With heavy body, as air is with the \
earth Conjoined, and energy of mind with us? Now let us sing what makes the \
stars to move. In first place, if the mighty sphere of heaven Revolveth \
round, then needs we must aver That on the upper and the under pole Presses a \
certain air, and from without Confines them and encloseth at each end; And \
that, moreover, another air above Streams on athwart the top of the sphere \
and tends In same direction as are rolled along The glittering stars of the \
eternal world; Or that another still streams on below To whirl the sphere \
from under up and on In opposite direction- as we see The rivers turn the \
wheels and water-scoops. It may be also that the heavens do all Remain at \
rest, whilst yet are borne along The lucid constellations; either because \
Swift tides of ether are by sky enclosed, And whirl around, seeking a passage \
out, And everywhere make roll the starry fires Through the Summanian regions \
of the sky; Or else because some air, streaming along From an eternal quarter \
off beyond, Whileth the driven fires, or, then, because The fires themselves \
have power to creep along, Going wherever their food invites and calls, And \
feeding their flaming bodies everywhere Throughout the sky. Yet which of \
these is cause In this our world 'tis hard to say for sure; But what can be \
throughout the universe, In divers worlds on divers plan create, This only do \
I show, and follow on To assign unto the motions of the stars Even several \
causes which 'tis possible Exist throughout the universal All; Of which yet \
one must be the cause even here Which maketh motion for our constellations. \
Yet to decide which one of them it be Is not the least the business of a man \
Advancing step by cautious step, as I. Nor can the sun's wheel larger be by \
much Nor its own blaze much less than either seems Unto our senses. For from \
whatso spaces Fires have the power on us to cast their beams And blow their \
scorching exhalations forth Against our members, those same distances Take \
nothing by those intervals away From bulk of flames; and to the sight the \
fire Is nothing shrunken. Therefore, since the heat And the outpoured light \
of skiey sun Arrive our senses and caress our limbs, Form too and bigness of \
the sun must look Even here from earth just as they really be, So that thou \
canst scarce nothing take or add. And whether the journeying moon illuminate \
The regions round with bastard beams, or throw From off her proper body her \
own light,- Whichever it be, she journeys with a form Naught larger than the \
form doth seem to be Which we with eyes of ours perceive. For all The far \
removed objects of our gaze Seem through much air confused in their look Ere \
minished in their bigness. Wherefore, moon, Since she presents bright look \
and clear-cut form, May there on high by us on earth be seen Just as she is \
with extreme bounds defined, And just of the size. And lastly, whatso fires \
Of ether thou from earth beholdest, these Thou mayst consider as possibly of \
size The least bit less, or larger by a hair Than they appear- since whatso \
fires we view Here in the lands of earth are seen to change From time to time \
their size to less or more Only the least, when more or less away, So long as \
still they bicker clear, and still Their glow's perceived. Nor need there be \
for men Astonishment that yonder sun so small Can yet send forth so great a \
light as fills Oceans and all the lands and sky aflood, And with its fiery \
exhalations steeps The world at large. For it may be, indeed, That one \
vast-flowing well-spring of the whole Wide world from here hath opened and \
out-gushed, And shot its light abroad; because thuswise The elements of fiery \
exhalations From all the world around together come, And thuswise flow into a \
bulk so big That from one single fountain-head may stream This heat and \
light. And seest thou not, indeed, How widely one small water-spring may wet \
The meadow-lands at times and flood the fields? 'Tis even possible, besides, \
that heat From forth the sun's own fire, albeit that fire Be not a great, may \
permeate the air With the fierce hot- if but, perchance, the air Be of \
condition and so tempered then As to be kindled, even when beat upon Only by \
little particles of heat- Just as we sometimes see the standing grain Or \
stubble straw in conflagration all From one lone spark. And possibly the sun, \
Agleam on high with rosy lampion, Possesses about him with invisible heats A \
plenteous fire, by no effulgence marked, So that he maketh, he, the \
Fraught-with-fire, Increase to such degree the force of rays. Nor is there \
one sure cause revealed to men How the sun journeys from his summer haunts On \
to the mid-most winter turning-points In Capricorn, the thence reverting \
veers Back to solstitial goals of Cancer; nor How 'tis the moon is seen each \
month to cross That very distance which in traversing The sun consumes the \
measure of a year. I say, no one clear reason hath been given For these \
affairs. Yet chief in likelihood Seemeth the doctrine which the holy thought \
Of great Democritus lays down: that ever The nearer the constellations be to \
earth The less can they by whirling of the sky Be borne along, because those \
skiey powers Of speed aloft do vanish and decrease In under-regions, and the \
sun is thus Left by degrees behind amongst those signs That follow after, \
since the sun he lies Far down below the starry signs that blaze; And the \
moon lags even tardier than the sun: In just so far as is her course removed \
From upper heaven and nigh unto the lands, In just so far she fails to keep \
the pace With starry signs above; for just so far As feebler is the whirl \
that bears her on, (Being, indeed, still lower than the sun), In just so far \
do all the starry signs, Circling around, o'ertake her and o'erpass. \
Therefore it happens that the moon appears More swiftly to return to any sign \
Along the Zodiac, than doth the sun, Because those signs do visit her again \
More swiftly than they visit the great sun. It can be also that two streams \
of air Alternately at fixed periods Blow out from transverse regions of the \
world, Of which the one may thrust the sun away From summer-signs to mid-most \
winter goals And rigors of the cold, and the other then May cast him back \
from icy shades of chill Even to the heat-fraught regions and the signs That \
blaze along the Zodiac. So, too, We must suppose the moon and all the stars, \
Which through the mighty and sidereal years Roll round in mighty orbits, may \
be sped By streams of air from regions alternate. Seest thou not also how the \
clouds be sped By contrary winds to regions contrary, The lower clouds \
diversely from the upper? Then, why may yonder stars in ether there Along \
their mighty orbits not be borne By currents opposite the one to other? But \
night o'erwhelms the lands with vasty murk Either when sun, after his diurnal \
course, Hath walked the ultimate regions of the sky And wearily hath panted \
forth his fires, Shivered by their long journeying and wasted By traversing \
the multitudinous air, Or else because the self-same force that drave His orb \
along above the lands compels Him then to turn his course beneath the lands. \
Matuta also at a fixed hour Spreadeth the roseate morning out along The \
coasts of heaven and deploys the light, Either because the self-same sun, \
returning Under the lands, aspires to seize the sky, Striving to set it \
blazing with his rays Ere he himself appear, or else because Fires then will \
congregate and many seeds Of heat are wont, even at a fixed time, To stream \
together- gendering evermore New suns and light. Just so the story goes That \
from the Idaean mountain-tops are seen Dispersed fires upon the break of day \
Which thence combine, as 'twere, into one ball And form an orb. Nor yet in \
these affairs Is aught for wonder that these seeds of fire Can thus together \
stream at time so fixed And shape anew the splendour of the sun. For many \
facts we see which come to pass At fixed time in all things: burgeon shrubs \
At fixed time, and at a fixed time They cast their flowers; and Eld commands \
the teeth, At time as surely fixed, to drop away, And Youth commands the \
growing boy to bloom With the soft down and let from both his cheeks The soft \
beard fall. And lastly, thunder-bolts, Snow, rains, clouds, winds, at seasons \
of the year Nowise unfixed, all do come to pass. For where, even from their \
old primordial start Causes have ever worked in such a way, And where, even \
from the world's first origin, Thuswise have things befallen, so even now \
After a fixed order they come round In sequence also. Likewise, days may wax \
Whilst the nights wane, and daylight minished be Whilst nights do take their \
augmentations, Either because the self-same sun, coursing Under the lands and \
over in two arcs, A longer and a briefer, doth dispart The coasts of ether \
and divides in twain His orbit all unequally, and adds, As round he's borne, \
unto the one half there As much as from the other half he's ta'en, Until he \
then arrives that sign of heaven Where the year's node renders the shades of \
night Equal unto the periods of light. For when the sun is midway on his \
course Between the blasts of northwind and of south, Heaven keeps his two \
goals parted equally, By virtue of the fixed position old Of the whole starry \
Zodiac, through which That sun, in winding onward, takes a year, Illumining \
the sky and all the lands With oblique light- as men declare to us Who by \
their diagrams have charted well Those regions of the sky which be adorned \
With the arranged signs of Zodiac. Or else, because in certain parts the air \
Under the lands is denser, the tremulous Bright beams of fire do waver \
tardily, Nor easily can penetrate that air Nor yet emerge unto their \
rising-place: For this it is that nights in winter time Do linger long, ere \
comes the many-rayed Round Badge of the day. Or else because, as said, In \
alternating seasons of the year Fires, now more quick, and now more slow, are \
wont To stream together,- the fires which make the sun To rise in some one \
spot- therefore it is That those men seem to speak the truth [who hold A new \
sun is with each new daybreak born]. The moon she possibly doth shine because \
Strook by the rays of sun, and day by day May turn unto our gaze her light, \
the more She doth recede from orb of sun, until, Facing him opposite across \
the world, She hath with full effulgence gleamed abroad, And, at her rising \
as she soars above, Hath there observed his setting; thence likewise She \
needs must hide, as 'twere, her light behind By slow degrees, the nearer now \
she glides, Along the circle of the Zodiac, From her far place toward fires \
of yonder sun,- As those men hold who feign the moon to be Just like a ball \
and to pursue a course Betwixt the sun and earth. There is, again, Some \
reason to suppose that moon may roll With light her very own, and thus \
display The varied shapes of her resplendence there. For near her is, \
percase, another body, Invisible, because devoid of light, Borne on and \
gliding all along with her, Which in three modes may block and blot her disk. \
Again, she may revolve upon herself, Like to a ball's sphere- if perchance \
that be- One half of her dyed o'er with glowing light, And by the revolution \
of that sphere She may beget for us her varying shapes, Until she turns that \
fiery part of her Full to the sight and open eyes of men; Thence by slow \
stages round and back she whirls, Withdrawing thus the luminiferous part Of \
her sphered mass and ball, as, verily, The Babylonian doctrine of Chaldees, \
Refuting the art of Greek astrologers, Labours, in opposition, to prove sure- \
As if, forsooth, the thing for which each fights, Might not alike be true,- \
or aught there were Wherefore thou mightest risk embracing one More than the \
other notion. Then, again, Why a new moon might not forevermore Created be \
with fixed successions there Of shapes and with configurations fixed, And why \
each day that bright created moon Might not miscarry and another be, In its \
stead and place, engendered anew, 'Tis hard to show by reason, or by words To \
prove absurd- since, lo, so many things Can be create with fixed successions: \
Spring-time and Venus come, and Venus' boy, The winged harbinger, steps on \
before, And hard on Zephyr's foot-prints Mother Flora, Sprinkling the ways \
before them, filleth all With colours and with odours excellent; Whereafter \
follows arid Heat, and he Companioned is by Ceres, dusty one, And by the \
Etesian Breezes of the north; Then cometh Autumn on, and with him steps Lord \
Bacchus, and then other Seasons too And other Winds do follow- the high roar \
Of great Volturnus, and the Southwind strong With thunder-bolts. At last \
earth's Shortest-Day Bears on to men the snows and brings again The numbing \
cold. And Winter follows her, His teeth with chills a-chatter. Therefore, \
'tis The less a marvel, if at fixed time A moon is thus begotten and again At \
fixed time destroyed, since things so many Can come to being thus at fixed \
time. Likewise, the sun's eclipses and the moon's Far occultations rightly \
thou mayst deem As due to several causes. For, indeed, Why should the moon be \
able to shut out Earth from the light of sun, and on the side To earthward \
thrust her high head under sun, Opposing dark orb to his glowing beams- And \
yet, at same time, one suppose the effect Could not result from some one \
other body Which glides devoid of light forevermore? Again, why could not \
sun, in weakened state, At fixed time for-lose his fires, and then, When he \
has passed on along the air Beyond the regions, hostile to his flames, That \
quench and kill his fires, why could not he Renew his light? And why should \
earth in turn Have power to rob the moon of light, and there, Herself on \
high, keep the sun hid beneath, Whilst the moon glideth in her monthly course \
Athrough the rigid shadows of the cone?- And yet, at same time, some one \
other body Not have the power to under-pass the moon, Or glide along above \
the orb of sun, Breaking his rays and outspread light asunder? And still, if \
moon herself refulgent be With her own sheen, why could she not at times In \
some one quarter of the mighty world Grow weak and weary, whilst she passeth \
through Regions unfriendly to the beams her own? ORIGINS OF VEGETABLE AND \
ANIMAL LIFE And now to what remains!- Since I've resolved By what \
arrangements all things come to pass Through the blue regions of the mighty \
world,- How we can know what energy and cause Started the various courses of \
the sun And the moon's goings, and by what far means They can succumb, the \
while with thwarted light, And veil with shade the unsuspecting lands, When, \
as it were, they blink, and then again With open eye survey all regions wide, \
Resplendent with white radiance- I do now Return unto the world's primeval \
age And tell what first the soft young fields of earth With earliest \
parturition had decreed To raise in air unto the shores of light And to \
entrust unto the wayward winds. In the beginning, earth gave forth, around \
The hills and over all the length of plains, The race of grasses and the \
shining green; The flowery meadows sparkled all aglow With greening colour, \
and thereafter, lo, Unto the divers kinds of trees was given An emulous \
impulse mightily to shoot, With a free rein, aloft into the air. As feathers \
and hairs and bristles are begot The first on members of the four-foot breeds \
And on the bodies of the strong-y-winged, Thus then the new Earth first of \
all put forth Grasses and shrubs, and afterward begat The mortal generations, \
there upsprung- Innumerable in modes innumerable- After diverging fashions. \
For from sky These breathing-creatures never can have dropped, Nor the \
land-dwellers ever have come up Out of sea-pools of salt. How true remains, \
How merited is that adopted name Of earth- \"The Mother!\"- since from out \
the earth Are all begotten. And even now arise From out the loams how many \
living things- Concreted by the rains and heat of the sun. Wherefore 'tis \
less a marvel, if they sprang In Long Ago more many, and more big, Matured of \
those days in the fresh young years Of earth and ether. First of all, the \
race Of the winged ones and parti-coloured birds, Hatched out in spring-time, \
left their eggs behind; As now-a-days in summer tree-crickets Do leave their \
shiny husks of own accord, Seeking their food and living. Then it was This \
earth of thine first gave unto the day The mortal generations; for prevailed \
Among the fields abounding hot and wet. And hence, where any fitting spot was \
given, There 'gan to grow womb-cavities, by roots Affixed to earth. And when \
in ripened time The age of the young within (that sought the air And fled \
earth's damps) had burst these wombs, O then Would Nature thither turn the \
pores of earth And make her spurt from open veins a juice Like unto milk; \
even as a woman now Is filled, at child-bearing, with the sweet milk, Because \
all that swift stream of aliment Is thither turned unto the mother-breasts. \
There earth would furnish to the children food; Warmth was their swaddling \
cloth, the grass their bed Abounding in soft down. Earth's newness then Would \
rouse no dour spells of the bitter cold, Nor extreme heats nor winds of \
mighty powers- For all things grow and gather strength through time In like \
proportions; and then earth was young. Wherefore, again, again, how merited \
Is that adopted name of Earth- The Mother!- Since she herself begat the human \
race, And at one well-nigh fixed time brought forth Each breast that ranges \
raving round about Upon the mighty mountains and all birds Aerial with many a \
varied shape. But, lo, because her bearing years must end, She ceased, like \
to a woman worn by eld. For lapsing aeons change the nature of The whole wide \
world, and all things needs must take One status after other, nor aught \
persists Forever like itself. All things depart; Nature she changeth all, \
compelleth all To transformation. Lo, this moulders down, A-slack with weary \
eld, and that, again, Prospers in glory, issuing from contempt. In suchwise, \
then, the lapsing aeons change The nature of the whole wide world, and earth \
Taketh one status after other. And what She bore of old, she now can bear no \
longer, And what she never bore, she can to-day. In those days also the \
telluric world Strove to beget the monsters that upsprung With their \
astounding visages and limbs- The Man-woman- a thing betwixt the twain, Yet \
neither, and from either sex remote- Some gruesome Boggles orphaned of the \
feet, Some widowed of the hands, dumb Horrors too Without a mouth, or blind \
Ones of no eye, Or Bulks all shackled by their legs and arms Cleaving unto \
the body fore and aft, Thuswise, that never could they do or go, Nor shun \
disaster, nor take the good they would. And other prodigies and monsters \
earth Was then begetting of this sort- in vain, Since Nature banned with \
horror their increase, And powerless were they to reach unto The coveted \
flower of fair maturity, Or to find aliment, or to intertwine In works of \
Venus. For we see there must Concur in life conditions manifold, If life is \
ever by begetting life To forge the generations one by one: First, foods must \
be; and, next, a path whereby The seeds of impregnation in the frame May \
ooze, released from the members all; Last, the possession of those \
instruments Whereby the male with female can unite, The one with other in \
mutual ravishments. And in the ages after monsters died, Perforce there \
perished many a stock, unable By propagation to forge a progeny. For \
whatsoever creatures thou beholdest Breathing the breath of life, the same \
have been Even from their earliest age preserved alive By cunning, or by \
valour, or at least By speed of foot or wing. And many a stock Remaineth yet, \
because of use to man, And so committed to man's guardianship. Valour hath \
saved alive fierce lion-breeds And many another terrorizing race, Cunning the \
foxes, flight the antlered stags. Light-sleeping dogs with faithful heart in \
breast, However, and every kind begot from seed Of beasts of draft, as, too, \
the woolly flocks And horned cattle, all, my Memmius, Have been committed to \
guardianship of men. For anxiously they fled the savage beasts, And peace \
they sought and their abundant foods, Obtained with never labours of their \
own, Which we secure to them as fit rewards For their good service. But those \
beasts to whom Nature has granted naught of these same things- Beasts quite \
unfit by own free will to thrive And vain for any service unto us In thanks \
for which we should permit their kind To feed and be in our protection safe- \
Those, of a truth, were wont to be exposed, Enshackled in the gruesome bonds \
of doom, As prey and booty for the rest, until Nature reduced that stock to \
utter death. But Centaurs ne'er have been, nor can there be Creatures of \
twofold stock and double frame, Compact of members alien in kind, Yet formed \
with equal function, equal force In every bodily part- a fact thou mayst, \
However dull thy wits, well learn from this: The horse, when his three years \
have rolled away, Flowers in his prime of vigour; but the boy Not so, for oft \
even then he gropes in sleep After the milky nipples of the breasts, An \
infant still. And later, when at last The lusty powers of horses and stout \
limbs, Now weak through lapsing life, do fail with age, Lo, only then doth \
youth with flowering years Begin for boys, and clothe their ruddy cheeks With \
the soft down. So never deem, percase, That from a man and from the seed of \
horse, The beast of draft, can Centaurs be composed Or e'er exist alive, nor \
Scyllas be- The half-fish bodies girdled with mad dogs- Nor others of this \
sort, in whom we mark Members discordant each with each; for ne'er At one \
same time they reach their flower of age Or gain and lose full vigour of \
their frame, And never burn with one same lust of love, And never in their \
habits they agree, Nor find the same foods equally delightsome- Sooth, as one \
oft may see the bearded goats Batten upon the hemlock which to man Is violent \
poison. Once again, since flame Is wont to scorch and burn the tawny bulks Of \
the great lions as much as other kinds Of flesh and blood existing in the \
lands, How could it be that she, Chimaera lone, With triple body- fore, a \
lion she; And aft, a dragon; and betwixt, a goat- Might at the mouth from out \
the body belch Infuriate flame? Wherefore, the man who feigns Such beings \
could have been engendered When earth was new and the young sky was fresh \
(Basing his empty argument on new) May babble with like reason many whims \
Into our ears: he'll say, perhaps, that then Rivers of gold through every \
landscape flowed, That trees were wont with precious stones to flower, Or \
that in those far aeons man was born With such gigantic length and lift of \
limbs As to be able, based upon his feet, Deep oceans to bestride or with his \
hands To whirl the firmament around his head. For though in earth were many \
seeds of things In the old time when this telluric world First poured the \
breeds of animals abroad, Still that is nothing of a sign that then Such \
hybrid creatures could have been begot And limbs of all beasts heterogeneous \
Have been together knit; because, indeed, The divers kinds of grasses and the \
grains And the delightsome trees- which even now Spring up abounding from \
within the earth- Can still ne'er be begotten with their stems Begrafted into \
one; but each sole thing Proceeds according to its proper wont And all \
conserve their own distinctions based In nature's fixed decree. ORIGINS AND \
SAVAGE PERIOD OF MANKIND But mortal man Was then far hardier in the old \
champaign, As well he should be, since a hardier earth Had him begotten; \
builded too was he Of bigger and more solid bones within, And knit with \
stalwart sinews through the flesh, Nor easily seized by either heat or cold, \
Or alien food or any ail or irk. And whilst so many lustrums of the sun \
Rolled on across the sky, men led a life After the roving habit of wild \
beasts. Not then were sturdy guiders of curved ploughs, And none knew then to \
work the fields with iron, Or plant young shoots in holes of delved loam, Or \
lop with hooked knives from off high trees The boughs of yester-year. What \
sun and rains To them had given, what earth of own accord Created then, was \
boon enough to glad Their simple hearts. Mid acorn-laden oaks Would they \
refresh their bodies for the nonce; And the wild berries of the arbute-tree, \
Which now thou seest to ripen purple-red In winter time, the old telluric \
soil Would bear then more abundant and more big. And many coarse foods, too, \
in long ago The blooming freshness of the rank young world Produced, enough \
for those poor wretches there. And rivers and springs would summon them of \
old To slake the thirst, as now from the great hills The water's down-rush \
calls aloud and far The thirsty generations of the wild. So, too, they sought \
the grottos of the Nymphs- The woodland haunts discovered as they ranged- \
From forth of which they knew that gliding rills With gush and splash \
abounding laved the rocks, The dripping rocks, and trickled from above Over \
the verdant moss; and here and there Welled up and burst across the open \
flats. As yet they knew not to enkindle fire Against the cold, nor hairy \
pelts to use And clothe their bodies with the spoils of beasts; But huddled \
in groves, and mountain-caves, and woods, And 'mongst the thickets hid their \
squalid backs, When driven to flee the lashings of the winds And the big \
rains. Nor could they then regard The general good, nor did they know to use \
In common any customs, any laws: Whatever of booty fortune unto each Had \
proffered, each alone would bear away, By instinct trained for self to thrive \
and live. And Venus in the forests then would link The lovers' bodies; for \
the woman yielded Either from mutual flame, or from the man's Impetuous fury \
and insatiate lust, Or from a bribe- as acorn-nuts, choice pears, Or the wild \
berries of the arbute-tree. And trusting wondrous strength of hands and legs, \
They'd chase the forest-wanderers, the beasts; And many they'd conquer, but \
some few they fled, A-skulk into their hiding-places... With the flung stones \
and with the ponderous heft Of gnarled branch. And by the time of night \
O'ertaken, they would throw, like bristly boars, Their wildman's limbs naked \
upon the earth, Rolling themselves in leaves and fronded boughs. Nor would \
they call with lamentations loud Around the fields for daylight and the sun, \
Quaking and wand'ring in shadows of the night; But, silent and buried in a \
sleep, they'd wait Until the sun with rosy flambeau brought The glory to the \
sky. From childhood wont Ever to see the dark and day begot In times \
alternate, never might they be Wildered by wild misgiving, lest a night \
Eternal should possess the lands, with light Of sun withdrawn forever. But \
their care Was rather that the clans of savage beasts Would often make their \
sleep-time horrible For those poor wretches; and, from home y-driven, They'd \
flee their rocky shelters at approach Of boar, the spumy-lipped, or lion \
strong, And in the midnight yield with terror up To those fierce guests their \
beds of out-spread leaves. And yet in those days not much more than now Would \
generations of mortality Leave the sweet light of fading life behind. Indeed, \
in those days here and there a man, More oftener snatched upon, and gulped by \
fangs, Afforded the beasts a food that roared alive, Echoing through groves \
and hills and forest-trees, Even as he viewed his living flesh entombed \
Within a living grave; whilst those whom flight Had saved, with bone and body \
bitten, shrieked, Pressing their quivering palms to loathsome sores, With \
horrible voices for eternal death- Until, forlorn of help, and witless what \
Might medicine their wounds, the writhing pangs Took them from life. But not \
in those far times Would one lone day give over unto doom A soldiery in \
thousands marching on Beneath the battle-banners, nor would then The ramping \
breakers of the main seas dash Whole argosies and crews upon the rocks. But \
ocean uprisen would often rave in vain, Without all end or outcome, and give \
up Its empty menacings as lightly too; Nor soft seductions of a serene sea \
Could lure by laughing billows any man Out to disaster: for the science bold \
Of ship-sailing lay dark in those far times. Again, 'twas then that lack of \
food gave o'er Men's fainting limbs to dissolution: now 'Tis plenty \
overwhelms. Unwary, they Oft for themselves themselves would then outpour The \
poison; now, with nicer art, themselves They give the drafts to others. \
BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION Afterwards, When huts they had procured and pelts \
and fire, And when the woman, joined unto the man, Withdrew with him into one \
dwelling place, Were known; and when they saw an offspring born From out \
themselves, then first the human race Began to soften. For 'twas now that \
fire Rendered their shivering frames less staunch to bear, Under the canopy \
of the sky, the cold; And Love reduced their shaggy hardiness; And children, \
with the prattle and the kiss, Soon broke the parents' haughty temper down. \
Then, too, did neighbours 'gin to league as friends, Eager to wrong no more \
or suffer wrong, And urged for children and the womankind Mercy, of fathers, \
whilst with cries and gestures They stammered hints how meet it was that all \
Should have compassion on the weak. And still, Though concord not in every \
wise could then Begotten be, a good, a goodly part Kept faith inviolate- or \
else mankind Long since had been unutterably cut off, And propagation never \
could have brought The species down the ages. Lest, perchance, Concerning \
these affairs thou ponderest In silent meditation, let me say 'Twas lightning \
brought primevally to earth The fire for mortals, and from thence hath spread \
O'er all the lands the flames of heat. For thus Even now we see so many \
objects, touched By the celestial flames, to flash aglow, When thunderbolt \
has dowered them with heat. Yet also when a many-branched tree, Beaten by \
winds, writhes swaying to and fro, Pressing 'gainst branches of a neighbour \
tree, There by the power of mighty rub and rub Is fire engendered; and at \
times out-flares The scorching heat of flame, when boughs do chafe Against \
the trunks. And of these causes, either May well have given to mortal men the \
fire. Next, food to cook and soften in the flame The sun instructed, since so \
oft they saw How objects mellowed, when subdued by warmth And by the raining \
blows of fiery beams, Through all the fields. And more and more each day \
Would men more strong in sense, more wise in heart, Teach them to change \
their earlier mode and life By fire and new devices. Kings began Cities to \
found and citadels to set, As strongholds and asylums for themselves, And \
flocks and fields to portion for each man After the beauty, strength, and \
sense of each- For beauty then imported much, and strength Had its own rights \
supreme. Thereafter, wealth Discovered was, and gold was brought to light, \
Which soon of honour stripped both strong and fair; For men, however \
beautiful in form Or valorous, will follow in the main The rich man's party. \
Yet were man to steer His life by sounder reasoning, he'd own Abounding \
riches, if with mind content He lived by thrift; for never, as I guess, Is \
there a lack of little in the world. But men wished glory for themselves and \
power Even that their fortunes on foundations firm Might rest forever, and \
that they themselves, The opulent, might pass a quiet life- In vain, in vain; \
since, in the strife to climb On to the heights of honour, men do make Their \
pathway terrible; and even when once They reach them, envy like the \
thunderbolt At times will smite, O hurling headlong down To murkiest \
Tartarus, in scorn; for, lo, All summits, all regions loftier than the rest, \
Smoke, blasted as by envy's thunderbolts; So better far in quiet to obey, \
Than to desire chief mastery of affairs And ownership of empires. Be it so; \
And let the weary sweat their life-blood out All to no end, battling in hate \
along The narrow path of man's ambition; Since all their wisdom is from \
others' lips, And all they seek is known from what they've heard And less \
from what they've thought. Nor is this folly Greater to-day, nor greater soon \
to be, Than' twas of old. And therefore kings were slain, And pristine \
majesty of golden thrones And haughty sceptres lay o'erturned in dust; And \
crowns, so splendid on the sovereign heads, Soon bloody under the proletarian \
feet, Groaned for their glories gone- for erst o'er-much Dreaded, thereafter \
with more greedy zest Trampled beneath the rabble heel. Thus things Down to \
the vilest lees of brawling mobs Succumbed, whilst each man sought unto \
himself Dominion and supremacy. So next Some wiser heads instructed men to \
found The magisterial office, and did frame Codes that they might consent to \
follow laws. For humankind, o'er wearied with a life Fostered by force, was \
ailing from its feuds; And so the sooner of its own free will Yielded to laws \
and strictest codes. For since Each hand made ready in its wrath to take A \
vengeance fiercer than by man's fair laws Is now conceded, men on this \
account Loathed the old life fostered by force. 'Tis thence That fear of \
punishments defiles each prize Of wicked days; for force and fraud ensnare \
Each man around, and in the main recoil On him from whence they sprung. Not \
easy 'tis For one who violates by ugly deeds The bonds of common peace to \
pass a life Composed and tranquil. For albeit he 'scape The race of gods and \
men, he yet must dread 'Twill not be hid forever- since, indeed, So many, oft \
babbling on amid their dreams Or raving in sickness, have betrayed themselves \
(As stories tell) and published at last Old secrets and the sins. But nature \
'twas Urged men to utter various sounds of tongue And need and use did mould \
the names of things, About in same wise as the lack-speech years Compel young \
children unto gesturings, Making them point with finger here and there At \
what's before them. For each creature feels By instinct to what use to put \
his powers. Ere yet the bull-calf's scarce begotten horns Project above his \
brows, with them he 'gins Enraged to butt and savagely to thrust. But whelps \
of panthers and the lion's cubs With claws and paws and bites are at the fray \
Already, when their teeth and claws be scarce As yet engendered. So again, we \
see All breeds of winged creatures trust to wings And from their fledgling \
pinions seek to get A fluttering assistance. Thus, to think That in those \
days some man apportioned round To things their names, and that from him men \
learned Their first nomenclature, is foolery. For why could he mark \
everything by words And utter the various sounds of tongue, what time The \
rest may be supposed powerless To do the same? And, if the rest had not \
Already one with other used words, Whence was implanted in the teacher, then, \
Fore-knowledge of their use, and whence was given To him alone primordial \
faculty To know and see in mind what 'twas he willed? Besides, one only man \
could scarce subdue An overmastered multitude to choose To get by heart his \
names of things. A task Not easy 'tis in any wise to teach And to persuade \
the deaf concerning what 'Tis needful for to do. For ne'er would they Allow, \
nor ne'er in anywise endure Perpetual vain dingdong in their ears Of spoken \
sounds unheard before. And what, At last, in this affair so wondrous is, That \
human race (in whom a voice and tongue Were now in vigour) should by divers \
words Denote its objects, as each divers sense Might prompt?- since even the \
speechless herds, aye, since The very generations of wild beasts Are wont \
dissimilar and divers sounds To rouse from in them, when there's fear or \
pain, And when they burst with joys. And this, forsooth, 'Tis thine to know \
from plainest facts: when first Huge flabby jowls of mad Molossian hounds, \
Baring their hard white teeth, begin to snarl, They threaten, with infuriate \
lips peeled back, In sounds far other than with which they bark And fill with \
voices all the regions round. And when with fondling tongue they start to \
lick Their puppies, or do toss them round with paws, Feigning with gentle \
bites to gape and snap, They fawn with yelps of voice far other then Than \
when, alone within the house, they bay, Or whimpering slink with cringing \
sides from blows. Again the neighing of the horse, is that Not seen to differ \
likewise, when the stud In buoyant flower of his young years raves, Goaded by \
winged Love, amongst the mares, And when with widening nostrils out he snorts \
The call to battle, and when haply he Whinnies at times with terror-quaking \
limbs? Lastly, the flying race, the dappled birds, Hawks, ospreys, sea-gulls, \
searching food and life Amid the ocean billows in the brine, Utter at other \
times far other cries Than when they fight for food, or with their prey \
Struggle and strain. And birds there are which change With changing weather \
their own raucous songs- As long-lived generations of the crows Or flocks of \
rooks, when they be said to cry For rain and water and to call at times For \
winds and gales. Ergo, if divers moods Compel the brutes, though speechless \
evermore, To send forth divers sounds, O truly then How much more likely \
'twere that mortal men In those days could with many a different sound Denote \
each separate thing. And now what cause Hath spread divinities of gods abroad \
Through mighty nations, and filled the cities full Of the high altars, and \
led to practices Of solemn rites in season- rites which still Flourish in \
midst of great affairs of state And midst great centres of man's civic life, \
The rites whence still a poor mortality Is grafted that quaking awe which \
rears aloft Still the new temples of gods from land to land And drives \
mankind to visit them in throngs On holy days- 'tis not so hard to give \
Reason thereof in speech. Because, in sooth, Even in those days would the \
race of man Be seeing excelling visages of gods With mind awake; and in his \
sleeps, yet more- Bodies of wondrous growth. And, thus, to these Would men \
attribute sense, because they seemed To move their limbs and speak \
pronouncements high, Befitting glorious visage and vast powers. And men would \
give them an eternal life, Because their visages forevermore Were there \
before them, and their shapes remained, And chiefly, however, because men \
would not think Beings augmented with such mighty powers Could well by any \
force o'ermastered be. And men would think them in their happiness Excelling \
far, because the fear of death Vexed no one of them at all, and since At same \
time in men's sleeps men saw them do So many wonders, and yet feel therefrom \
Themselves no weariness. Besides, men marked How in a fixed order rolled \
around The systems of the sky, and changed times Of annual seasons, nor were \
able then To know thereof the causes. Therefore 'twas Men would take refuge \
in consigning all Unto divinities, and in feigning all Was guided by their \
nod. And in the sky They set the seats and vaults of gods, because Across the \
sky night and the moon are seen To roll along- moon, day, and night, and \
night's Old awesome constellations evermore, And the night-wandering \
fireballs of the sky, And flying flames, clouds, and the sun, the rains, Snow \
and the winds, the lightnings, and the hail, And the swift rumblings, and the \
hollow roar Of mighty menacings forevermore. O humankind unhappy!- when it \
ascribed Unto divinities such awesome deeds, And coupled thereto rigours of \
fierce wrath! What groans did men on that sad day beget Even for themselves, \
and O what wounds for us, What tears for our children's children! Nor, O man, \
Is thy true piety in this: with head Under the veil, still to be seen to turn \
Fronting a stone, and ever to approach Unto all altars; nor so prone on earth \
Forward to fall, to spread upturned palms Before the shrines of gods, nor yet \
to dew Altars with profuse blood of four-foot beasts, Nor vows with vows to \
link. But rather this: To look on all things with a master eye And mind at \
peace. For when we gaze aloft Upon the skiey vaults of yon great world And \
ether, fixed high o'er twinkling stars, And into our thought there come the \
journeyings Of sun and moon, O then into our breasts, O'erburdened already \
with their other ills, Begins forthwith to rear its sudden head One more \
misgiving: lest o'er us, percase, It be the gods' immeasurable power That \
rolls, with varied motion, round and round The far white constellations. For \
the lack Of aught of reasons tries the puzzled mind: Whether was ever a \
birth-time of the world, And whether, likewise, any end shall be How far the \
ramparts of the world can still Outstand this strain of ever-roused motion, \
Or whether, divinely with eternal weal Endowed, they can through endless \
tracts of age Glide on, defying the o'er-mighty powers Of the immeasurable \
ages. Lo, What man is there whose mind with dread of gods Cringes not close, \
whose limbs with terror-spell Crouch not together, when the parched earth \
Quakes with the horrible thunderbolt amain, And across the mighty sky the \
rumblings run? Do not the peoples and the nations shake, And haughty kings do \
they not hug their limbs, Strook through with fear of the divinities, Lest \
for aught foully done or madly said The heavy time be now at hand to pay? \
When, too, fierce force of fury-winds at sea Sweepeth a navy's admiral down \
the main With his stout legions and his elephants, Doth he not seek the peace \
of gods with vows, And beg in prayer, a-tremble, lulled winds And friendly \
gales?- in vain, since, often up-caught In fury-cyclones, is he borne along, \
For all his mouthings, to the shoals of doom. Ah, so irrevocably some hidden \
power Betramples forevermore affairs of men, And visibly grindeth with its \
heel in mire The lictors' glorious rods and axes dire, Having them in \
derision! Again, when earth From end to end is rocking under foot, And shaken \
cities ruin down, or threaten Upon the verge, what wonder is it then That \
mortal generations abase themselves, And unto gods in all affairs of earth \
Assign as last resort almighty powers And wondrous energies to govern all? \
Now for the rest: copper and gold and iron Discovered were, and with them \
silver's weight And power of lead, when with prodigious heat The \
conflagrations burned the forest trees Among the mighty mountains, by a bolt \
Of lightning from the sky, or else because Men, warring in the woodlands, on \
their foes Had hurled fire to frighten and dismay, Or yet because, by \
goodness of the soil Invited, men desired to clear rich fields And turn the \
countryside to pasture-lands, Or slay the wild and thrive upon the spoils. \
(For hunting by pit-fall and by fire arose Before the art of hedging the \
covert round With net or stirring it with dogs of chase.) Howso the fact, and \
from what cause soever The flamy heat with awful crack and roar Had there \
devoured to their deepest roots The forest trees and baked the earth with \
fire, Then from the boiling veins began to ooze O rivulets of silver and of \
gold, Of lead and copper too, collecting soon Into the hollow places of the \
ground. And when men saw the cooled lumps anon To shine with splendour-sheen \
upon the ground, Much taken with that lustrous smooth delight, They 'gan to \
pry them out, and saw how each Had got a shape like to its earthy mould. Then \
would it enter their heads how these same lumps, If melted by heat, could \
into any form Or figure of things be run, and how, again, If hammered out, \
they could be nicely drawn To sharpest points or finest edge, and thus Yield \
to the forgers tools and give them power To chop the forest down, to hew the \
logs, To shave the beams and planks, besides to bore And punch and drill. And \
men began such work At first as much with tools of silver and gold As with \
the impetuous strength of the stout copper; But vainly- since their \
over-mastered power Would soon give way, unable to endure, Like copper, such \
hard labour. In those days Copper it was that was the thing of price; And \
gold lay useless, blunted with dull edge. Now lies the copper low, and gold \
hath come Unto the loftiest honours. Thus it is That rolling ages change the \
times of things: What erst was of a price, becomes at last A discard of no \
honour; whilst another Succeeds to glory, issuing from contempt, And day by \
day is sought for more and more, And, when 'tis found, doth flower in men's \
praise, Objects of wondrous honour. Now, Memmius, How nature of iron \
discovered was, thou mayst Of thine own self divine. Man's ancient arms Were \
hands, and nails and teeth, stones too and boughs- Breakage of forest trees- \
and flame and fire, As soon as known. Thereafter force of iron And copper \
discovered was; and copper's use Was known ere iron's, since more tractable \
Its nature is and its abundance more. With copper men to work the soil began, \
With copper to rouse the hurly waves of war, To straw the monstrous wounds, \
and seize away Another's flocks and fields. For unto them, Thus armed, all \
things naked of defence Readily yielded. Then by slow degrees The sword of \
iron succeeded, and the shape Of brazen sickle into scorn was turned: With \
iron to cleave the soil of earth they 'gan, And the contentions of uncertain \
war Were rendered equal. And, lo, man was wont Armed to mount upon the ribs \
of horse And guide him with the rein, and play about With right hand free, \
oft times before he tried Perils of war in yoked chariot; And yoked pairs \
abreast came earlier Than yokes of four, or scythed chariots Whereinto clomb \
the men-at-arms. And next The Punic folk did train the elephants- Those curst \
Lucanian oxen, hideous, The serpent-handed, with turrets on their bulks- To \
dure the wounds of war and panic-strike The mighty troops of Mars. Thus \
Discord sad Begat the one Thing after other, to be The terror of the nations \
under arms, And day by day to horrors of old war She added an increase. \
Bulls, too, they tried In war's grim business; and essayed to send Outrageous \
boars against the foes. And some Sent on before their ranks puissant lions \
With armed trainers and with masters fierce To guide and hold in chains- and \
yet in vain, Since fleshed with pell-mell slaughter, fierce they flew, And \
blindly through the squadrons havoc wrought, Shaking the frightful crests \
upon their heads, Now here, now there. Nor could the horsemen calm Their \
horses, panic-breasted at the roar, And rein them round to front the foe. \
With spring The infuriate she-lions would up-leap Now here, now there; and \
whoso came apace Against them, these they'd rend across the face; And others \
unwitting from behind they'd tear Down from their mounts, and twining round \
them, bring Tumbling to earth, o'ermastered by the wound, And with those \
powerful fangs and hooked claws Fasten upon them. Bulls would toss their \
friends, And trample under foot, and from beneath Rip flanks and bellies of \
horses with their horns, And with a threat'ning forehead jam the sod; And \
boars would gore with stout tusks their allies, Splashing in fury their own \
blood on spears Splintered in their own bodies, and would fell In rout and \
ruin infantry and horse. For there the beasts-of-saddle tried to scape The \
savage thrusts of tusk by shying off, Or rearing up with hoofs a-paw in air. \
In vain- since there thou mightest see them sink, Their sinews severed, and \
with heavy fall Bestrew the ground. And such of these as men Supposed \
well-trained long ago at home, Were in the thick of action seen to foam In \
fury, from the wounds, the shrieks, the flight, The panic, and the tumult; \
nor could men Aught of their numbers rally. For each breed And various of the \
wild beasts fled apart Hither or thither, as often in wars to-day Flee those \
Lucanian oxen, by the steel Grievously mangled, after they have wrought Upon \
their friends so many a dreadful doom. (If 'twas, indeed, that thus they did \
at all: But scarcely I'll believe that men could not With mind foreknow and \
see, as sure to come, Such foul and general disaster.- This We, then, may \
hold as true in the great All, In divers worlds on divers plan create,- \
Somewhere afar more likely than upon One certain earth.) But men chose this \
to do Less in the hope of conquering than to give Their enemies a goodly \
cause of woe, Even though thereby they perished themselves, Since weak in \
numbers and since wanting arms. Now, clothes of roughly inter-plaited strands \
Were earlier than loom-wove coverings; The loom-wove later than man's iron \
is, Since iron is needful in the weaving art, Nor by no other means can there \
be wrought Such polished tools- the treadles, spindles, shuttles, And \
sounding yarn-beams. And nature forced the men, Before the woman kind, to \
work the wool: For all the male kind far excels in skill, And cleverer is by \
much- until at last The rugged farmer folk jeered at such tasks, And so were \
eager soon to give them o'er To women's hands, and in more hardy toil To \
harden arms and hands. But nature herself, Mother of things, was the first \
seed-sower And primal grafter; since the berries and acorns, Dropping from \
off the trees, would there beneath Put forth in season swarms of little \
shoots; Hence too men's fondness for ingrafting slips Upon the boughs and \
setting out in holes The young shrubs o'er the fields. Then would they try \
Ever new modes of tilling their loved crofts, And mark they would how earth \
improved the taste Of the wild fruits by fond and fostering care. And day by \
day they'd force the woods to move Still higher up the mountain, and to yield \
The place below for tilth, that there they might, On plains and uplands, have \
their meadow-plats, Cisterns and runnels, crops of standing grain, And happy \
vineyards, and that all along O'er hillocks, intervales, and plains might run \
The silvery-green belt of olive-trees, Marking the plotted landscape; even as \
now Thou seest so marked with varied loveliness All the terrain which men \
adorn and plant With rows of goodly fruit-trees and hedge round With thriving \
shrubberies sown. But by the mouth To imitate the liquid notes of birds Was \
earlier far 'mongst men than power to make, By measured song, melodious verse \
and give Delight to ears. And whistlings of the wind Athrough the hollows of \
the reeds first taught The peasantry to blow into the stalks Of hollow \
hemlock-herb. Then bit by bit They learned sweet plainings, such as pipe \
out-pours, Beaten by finger-tips of singing men, When heard through unpathed \
groves and forest deeps And woodsy meadows, through the untrod haunts Of \
shepherd folk and spots divinely still. Thus time draws forward each and \
everything Little by little unto the midst of men, And reason uplifts it to \
the shores of light. These tunes would soothe and glad the minds of mortals \
When sated with food,- for songs are welcome then. And often, lounging with \
friends in the soft grass Beside a river of water, underneath A big tree's \
branches, merrily they'd refresh Their frames, with no vast outlay- most of \
all If the weather were smiling and the times of the year Were painting the \
green of the grass around with flowers. Then jokes, then talk, then peals of \
jollity Would circle round; for then the rustic muse Was in her glory; then \
would antic Mirth Prompt them to garland head and shoulders about With \
chaplets of intertwined flowers and leaves, And to dance onward, out of tune, \
with limbs Clownishly swaying, and with clownish foot To beat our mother \
earth- from whence arose Laughter and peals of jollity, for, lo, Such frolic \
acts were in their glory then, Being more new and strange. And wakeful men \
Found solaces for their unsleeping hours In drawing forth variety of notes, \
In modulating melodies, in running With puckered lips along the tuned reeds, \
Whence, even in our day do the watchmen guard These old traditions, and have \
learned well To keep true measure. And yet they no whit Do get a larger fruit \
of gladsomeness Than got the woodland aborigines In olden times. For what we \
have at hand- If theretofore naught sweeter we have known- That chiefly \
pleases and seems best of all; But then some later, likely better, find \
Destroys its worth and changes our desires Regarding good of yesterday. And \
thus Began the loathing of the acorn; thus Abandoned were those beds with \
grasses strewn And with the leaves beladen. Thus, again, Fell into new \
contempt the pelts of beasts- Erstwhile a robe of honour, which, I guess, \
Aroused in those days envy so malign That the first wearer went to woeful \
death By ambuscades,- and yet that hairy prize, Rent into rags by greedy \
foemen there And splashed by blood, was ruined utterly Beyond all use or \
vantage. Thus of old 'Twas pelts, and of to-day 'tis purple and gold That \
cark men's lives with cares and weary with war. Wherefore, methinks, resides \
the greater blame With us vain men to-day: for cold would rack, Without their \
pelts, the naked sons of earth; But us it nothing hurts to do without The \
purple vestment, broidered with gold And with imposing figures, if we still \
Make shift with some mean garment of the Plebs. So man in vain futilities \
toils on Forever and wastes in idle cares his years- Because, of very truth, \
he hath not learnt What the true end of getting is, nor yet At all how far \
true pleasure may increase. And 'tis desire for better and for more Hath \
carried by degrees mortality Out onward to the deep, and roused up From the \
far bottom mighty waves of war. But sun and moon, those watchmen of the \
world, With their own lanterns traversing around The mighty, the revolving \
vault, have taught Unto mankind that seasons of the years Return again, and \
that the Thing takes place After a fixed plan and order fixed. Already would \
they pass their life, hedged round By the strong towers; and cultivate an \
earth All portioned out and boundaried; already Would the sea flower and \
sail-winged ships; Already men had, under treaty pacts, Confederates and \
allies, when poets began To hand heroic actions down in verse; Nor long ere \
this had letters been devised- Hence is our age unable to look back On what \
has gone before, except where reason Shows us a footprint. Sailings on the \
seas, Tillings of fields, walls, laws, and arms, and roads, Dress and the \
like, all prizes, all delights Of finer life, poems, pictures, chiselled \
shapes Of polished sculptures- all these arts were learned By practice and \
the mind's experience, As men walked forward step by eager step. Thus time \
draws forward each and everything Little by little into the midst of men, And \
reason uplifts it to the shores of light. For one thing after other did men \
see Grow clear by intellect, till with their arts They've now achieved the \
supreme pinnacle. BOOK VI PROEM 'Twas Athens first, the glorious in name, \
That whilom gave to hapless sons of men The sheaves of harvest, and \
re-ordered life, And decreed laws; and she the first that gave Life its sweet \
solaces, when she begat A man of heart so wise, who whilom poured All wisdom \
forth from his truth-speaking mouth; The glory of whom, though dead, is yet \
to-day, Because of those discoveries divine Renowned of old, exalted to the \
sky. For when saw he that well-nigh everything Which needs of man most \
urgently require Was ready to hand for mortals, and that life, As far as \
might be, was established safe, That men were lords in riches, honour, \
praise, And eminent in goodly fame of sons, And that they yet, O yet, within \
the home, Still had the anxious heart which vexed life Unpausingly with \
torments of the mind, And raved perforce with angry plaints, then he, Then \
he, the master, did perceive that 'twas The vessel itself which worked the \
bane, and all, However wholesome, which from here or there Was gathered into \
it, was by that bane Spoilt from within,- in part, because he saw The vessel \
so cracked and leaky that nowise 'T could ever be filled to brim; in part \
because He marked how it polluted with foul taste Whate'er it got within \
itself. So he, The master, then by his truth-speaking words, Purged the \
breasts of men, and set the bounds Of lust and terror, and exhibited The \
supreme good whither we all endeavour, And showed the path whereby we might \
arrive Thereunto by a little cross-cut straight, And what of ills in all \
affairs of mortals Upsprang and flitted deviously about (Whether by chance or \
force), since nature thus Had destined; and from out what gates a man Should \
sally to each combat. And he proved That mostly vainly doth the human race \
Roll in its bosom the grim waves of care. For just as children tremble and \
fear all In the viewless dark, so even we at times Dread in the light so many \
things that be No whit more fearsome than what children feign, Shuddering, \
will be upon them in the dark. This terror then, this darkness of the mind, \
Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light, Nor glittering arrows of \
morning can disperse, But only nature's aspect and her law. Wherefore the \
more will I go on to weave In verses this my undertaken task. And since I've \
taught thee that the world's great vaults Are mortal and that sky is \
fashioned Of frame e'en born in time, and whatsoe'er Therein go on and must \
perforce go on The most I have unravelled; what remains Do thou take in, \
besides; since once for all To climb into that chariot' renowned Of winds \
arise; and they appeased are So that all things again... Which were, are \
changed now, with fury stilled; All other movements through the earth and sky \
Which mortals gaze upon (O anxious oft In quaking thoughts!), and which abase \
their minds With dread of deities and press them crushed Down to the earth, \
because their ignorance Of cosmic causes forces them to yield All things unto \
the empery of gods And to concede the kingly rule to them. For even those men \
who have learned full well That godheads lead a long life free of care, If \
yet meanwhile they wonder by what plan Things can go on (and chiefly yon high \
things Observed o'erhead on the ethereal coasts), Again are hurried back unto \
the fears Of old religion and adopt again Harsh masters, deemed almighty,- \
wretched men, Unwitting what can be and what cannot, And by what law to each \
its scope prescribed, Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time. \
Wherefore the more are they borne wandering on By blindfold reason. And, \
Memmius, unless From out thy mind thou spuest all of this And casteth far \
from thee all thoughts which be Unworthy gods and alien to their peace, Then \
often will the holy majesties Of the high gods be harmful unto thee, As by \
thy thought degraded,- not, indeed, That essence supreme of gods could be by \
this So outraged as in wrath to thirst to seek Revenges keen; but even \
because thyself Thou plaguest with the notion that the gods, Even they, the \
Calm Ones in serene repose, Do roll the mighty waves of wrath on wrath; Nor \
wilt thou enter with a serene breast Shrines of the gods; nor wilt thou able \
be In tranquil peace of mind to take and know Those images which from their \
holy bodies Are carried into intellects of men, As the announcers of their \
form divine. What sort of life will follow after this 'Tis thine to see. But \
that afar from us Veriest reason may drive such life away, Much yet remains \
to be embellished yet In polished verses, albeit hath issued forth So much \
from me already; lo, there is The law and aspect of the sky to be By reason \
grasped; there are the tempest times And the bright lightnings to be hymned \
now- Even what they do and from what cause soe'er They're borne along- that \
thou mayst tremble not, Marking off regions of prophetic skies For auguries, \
O foolishly distraught Even as to whence the flying flame hath come, Or to \
which half of heaven it turns, or how Through walled places it hath wound its \
way, Or, after proving its dominion there, How it hath speeded forth from \
thence amain- Whereof nowise the causes do men know, And think divinities are \
working there. Do thou, Calliope, ingenious Muse, Solace of mortals and \
delight of gods, Point out the course before me, as I race On to the white \
line of the utmost goal, That I may get with signal praise the crown, With \
thee my guide! GREAT METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA, ETC. And so in first place, \
then, With thunder are shaken the blue deeps of heaven, Because the ethereal \
clouds, scudding aloft, Together clash, what time 'gainst one another The \
winds are battling. For never a sound there comes From out the serene regions \
of the sky; But wheresoever in a host more dense The clouds foregather, \
thence more often comes A crash with mighty rumbling. And, again, Clouds \
cannot be of so condensed a frame As stones and timbers, nor again so fine As \
mists and flying smoke; for then perforce They'd either fall, borne down by \
their brute weight, Like stones, or, like the smoke, they'd powerless be To \
keep their mass, or to retain within Frore snows and storms of hail. And they \
give forth O'er skiey levels of the spreading world A sound on high, as \
linen-awning, stretched O'er mighty theatres, gives forth at times A cracking \
roar, when much 'tis beaten about Betwixt the poles and cross-beams. \
Sometimes, too, Asunder rent by wanton gusts, it raves And imitates the \
tearing sound of sheets Of paper- even this kind of noise thou mayst In \
thunder hear- or sound as when winds whirl With lashings and do buffet about \
in air A hanging cloth and flying paper-sheets. For sometimes, too, it \
chances that the clouds Cannot together crash head-on, but rather Move \
side-wise and with motions contrary Graze each the other's body without \
speed, From whence that dry sound grateth on our ears, So long drawn-out, \
until the clouds have passed From out their close positions. And, again, In \
following wise all things seem oft to quake At shock of heavy thunder, and \
mightiest walls Of the wide reaches of the upper world There on the instant \
to have sprung apart, Riven asunder, what time a gathered blast Of the fierce \
hurricane hath all at once Twisted its way into a mass of clouds, And, there \
enclosed, ever more and more Compelleth by its spinning whirl the cloud To \
grow all hollow with a thickened crust Surrounding; for thereafter, when the \
force And the keen onset of the wind have weakened That crust, lo, then the \
cloud, to-split in twain, Gives forth a hideous crash with bang and boom. No \
marvel this; since oft a bladder small, Filled up with air, will, when of \
sudden burst, Give forth a like large sound. There's reason, too, Why clouds \
make sounds, as through them blow the winds: We see, borne down the sky, oft \
shapes of clouds Rough-edged or branched many forky ways; And 'tis the same, \
as when the sudden flaws Of north-west wind through the dense forest blow, \
Making the leaves to sough and limbs to crash. It happens too at times that \
roused force Of the fierce hurricane to-rends the cloud, Breaking right \
through it by a front assault; For what a blast of wind may do up there Is \
manifest from facts when here on earth A blast more gentle yet uptwists tall \
trees And sucks them madly from their deepest roots. Besides, among the \
clouds are waves, and these Give, as they roughly break, a rumbling roar; As \
when along deep streams or the great sea Breaks the loud surf. It happens, \
too, whenever Out from one cloud into another falls The fiery energy of \
thunderbolt, That straightaway the cloud, if full of wet, Extinguishes the \
fire with mighty noise; As iron, white from the hot furnaces, Sizzles, when \
speedily we've plunged its glow Down the cold water. Further, if a cloud More \
dry receive the fire, 'twill suddenly Kindle to flame and burn with monstrous \
sound, As if a flame with whirl of winds should range Along the \
laurel-tressed mountains far, Upburning with its vast assault those trees; \
Nor is there aught that in the crackling flame Consumes with sound more \
terrible to man Than Delphic laurel of Apollo lord. Oft, too, the \
multitudinous crash of ice And down-pour of swift hail gives forth a sound \
Among the mighty clouds on high; for when The wind hath packed them close, \
each mountain mass Of rain-cloud, there congealed utterly And mixed with \
hail-stones, breaks and booms... Likewise, it lightens, when the clouds have \
struck, By their collision, forth the seeds of fire: As if a stone should \
smite a stone or steel, For light then too leaps forth and fire then scatters \
The shining sparks. But with our ears we get The thunder after eyes behold \
the flash, Because forever things arrive the ears More tardily than the eyes- \
as thou mayst see From this example too: when markest thou Some man far \
yonder felling a great tree With double-edged ax, it comes to pass Thine eye \
beholds the swinging stroke before The blow gives forth a sound athrough \
thine ears: Thus also we behold the flashing ere We hear the thunder, which \
discharged is At same time with the fire and by same cause, Born of the same \
collision. In following wise The clouds suffuse with leaping light the lands, \
And the storm flashes with tremulous elan: When the wind hath invaded a \
cloud, and, whirling there, Hath wrought (as I have shown above) the cloud \
Into a hollow with a thickened crust, It becomes hot of own velocity: Just as \
thou seest how motion will o'erheat And set ablaze all objects,- verily A \
leaden ball, hurtling through length of space, Even melts. Therefore, when \
this same wind a-fire Hath split black cloud, it scatters the fire-seeds, \
Which, so to say, have been pressed out by force Of sudden from the cloud;- \
and these do make The pulsing flashes of flame; thence followeth The \
detonation which attacks our ears More tardily than aught which comes along \
Unto the sight of eyeballs. This takes place- As know thou mayst- at times \
when clouds are dense And one upon the other piled aloft With wonderful \
upheavings- nor be thou Deceived because we see how broad their base From \
underneath, and not how high they tower. For make thine observations at a \
time When winds shall bear athwart the horizon's blue Clouds like to \
mountain-ranges moving on, Or when about the sides of mighty peaks Thou seest \
them one upon the other massed And burdening downward, anchored in high \
repose, With the winds sepulchred on all sides round: Then canst thou know \
their mighty masses, then Canst view their caverns, as if builded there Of \
beetling crags; which, when the hurricanes In gathered storm have filled \
utterly, Then, prisoned in clouds, they rave around With mighty roarings, and \
within those dens Bluster like savage beasts, and now from here, And now from \
there, send growlings through the clouds, And seeking an outlet, whirl \
themselves about, And roll from 'mid the clouds the seeds of fire, And heap \
them multitudinously there, And in the hollow furnaces within Wheel flame \
around, until from bursted cloud In forky flashes they have gleamed forth. \
Again, from following cause it comes to pass That yon swift golden hue of \
liquid fire Darts downward to the earth: because the clouds Themselves must \
hold abundant seeds of fire; For, when they be without all moisture, then \
They be for most part of a flamy hue And a resplendent. And, indeed, they \
must Even from the light of sun unto themselves Take multitudinous seeds, and \
so perforce Redden and pour their bright fires all abroad. And therefore, \
when the wind hath driven and thrust, Hath forced and squeezed into one spot \
these clouds, They pour abroad the seeds of fire pressed out, Which make to \
flash these colours of the flame. Likewise, it lightens also when the clouds \
Grow rare and thin along the sky; for, when The wind with gentle touch \
unravels them And breaketh asunder as they move, those seeds Which make the \
lightnings must by nature fall; At such an hour the horizon lightens round \
Without the hideous terror of dread noise And skiey uproar. To proceed apace, \
What sort of nature thunderbolts possess Is by their strokes made manifest \
and by The brand-marks of their searing heat on things, And by the scorched \
scars exhaling round The heavy fumes of sulphur. For all these Are marks, O \
not of wind or rain, but fire. Again, they often enkindle even the roofs Of \
houses and inside the very rooms With swift flame hold a fierce dominion. \
Know thou that nature fashioned this fire Subtler than fires all other, with \
minute And dartling bodies,- a fire 'gainst which there's naught Can in the \
least hold out: the thunderbolt, The mighty, passes through the hedging walls \
Of houses, like to voices or a shout,- Through stones, through bronze it \
passes, and it melts Upon the instant bronze and gold; and makes, Likewise, \
the wines sudden to vanish forth, The wine-jars intact,- because, ye see, Its \
heat arriving renders loose and porous Readily all the wine- jar's earthen \
sides, And winding its way within, it scattereth The elements primordial of \
the wine With speedy dissolution- process which Even in an age the fiery \
steam of sun Could not accomplish, however puissant he With his hot \
coruscations: so much more Agile and overpowering is this force. Now in what \
manner engendered are these things, How fashioned of such impetuous strength \
As to cleave towers asunder, and houses all To overtopple, and to wrench \
apart Timbers and beams, and heroes' monuments To pile in ruins and upheave \
amain, And to take breath forever out of men, And to o'erthrow the cattle \
everywhere,- Yes, by what force the lightnings do all this, All this and \
more, I will unfold to thee, Nor longer keep thee in mere promises. The bolts \
of thunder, then, must be conceived As all begotten in those crasser clouds \
Up-piled aloft; for, from the sky serene And from the clouds of lighter \
density, None are sent forth forever. That 'tis so Beyond a doubt, fact plain \
to sense declares: To wit, at such a time the densed clouds So mass \
themselves through all the upper air That we might think that round about all \
murk Had parted forth from Acheron and filled The mighty vaults of sky- so \
grievously, As gathers thus the storm-clouds' gruesome might, Do faces of \
black horror hang on high- When tempest begins its thunderbolts to forge. \
Besides, full often also out at sea A blackest thunderhead, like cataract Of \
pitch hurled down from heaven, and far away Bulging with murkiness, down on \
the waves Falls with vast uproar, and draws on amain The darkling tempests \
big with thunderbolts And hurricanes, itself the while so crammed \
Tremendously with fires and winds, that even Back on the lands the people \
shudder round And seek for cover. Therefore, as I said, The storm must be \
conceived as o'er our head Towering most high; for never would the clouds \
O'erwhelm the lands with such a massy dark, Unless up-builded heap on lofty \
heap, To shut the round sun off. Nor could the clouds, As on they come, \
engulf with rain so vast As thus to make the rivers overflow And fields to \
float, if ether were not thus Furnished with lofty-piled clouds. Lo, then, \
Here be all things fulfilled with winds and fires- Hence the long lightnings \
and the thunders loud. For, verily, I've taught thee even now How cavernous \
clouds hold seeds innumerable Of fiery exhalations, and they must From off \
the sunbeams and the heat of these Take many still. And so, when that same \
wind (Which, haply, into one region of the sky Collects those clouds) hath \
pressed from out the same The many fiery seeds, and with that fire Hath at \
the same time inter-mixed itself, O then and there that wind, a whirlwind \
now, Deep in the belly of the cloud spins round In narrow confines, and \
sharpens there inside In glowing furnaces the thunderbolt. For in a two-fold \
manner is that wind Enkindled all: it trembles into heat Both by its own \
velocity and by Repeated touch of fire. Thereafter, when The energy of wind \
is heated through And the fierce impulse of the fire hath sped Deeply within, \
O then the thunderbolt, Now ripened, so to say, doth suddenly Splinter the \
cloud, and the aroused flash Leaps onward, lumining with forky light All \
places round. And followeth anon A clap so heavy that the skiey vaults, As if \
asunder burst, seem from on high To engulf the earth. Then fearfully a quake \
Pervades the lands, and 'long the lofty skies Run the far rumblings. For at \
such a time Nigh the whole tempest quakes, shook through and through, And \
roused are the roarings,- from which shock Comes such resounding and \
abounding rain, That all the murky ether seems to turn Now into rain, and, as \
it tumbles down, To summon the fields back to primeval floods: So big the \
rains that be sent down on men By burst of cloud and by the hurricane, What \
time the thunder-clap, from burning bolt That cracks the cloud, flies forth \
along. At times The force of wind, excited from without, Smiteth into a cloud \
already hot With a ripe thunderbolt. And when that wind Hath splintered that \
cloud, then down there cleaves forthwith Yon fiery coil of flame which still \
we call, Even with our fathers' word, a thunderbolt. The same thing haps \
toward every other side Whither that force hath swept. It happens, too, That \
sometimes force of wind, though hurtled forth Without all fire, yet in its \
voyage through space Igniteth, whilst it comes along, along,- Losing some \
larger bodies which cannot Pass, like the others, through the bulks of air,- \
And, scraping together out of air itself Some smaller bodies, carries them \
along, And these, commingling, by their flight make fire: Much in the manner \
as oft a leaden ball Grows hot upon its aery course, the while It loseth many \
bodies of stark cold And taketh into itself along the air New particles of \
fire. It happens, too, That force of blow itself arouses fire, When force of \
wind, a-cold and hurtled forth Without all fire, hath strook somewhere amain- \
No marvel, because, when with terrific stroke 'Thas smitten, the elements of \
fiery-stuff Can stream together from out the very wind And, simultaneously, \
from out that thing Which then and there receives the stroke: as flies The \
fire when with the steel we hack the stone; Nor yet, because the force of \
steel's a-cold, Rush the less speedily together there Under the stroke its \
seeds of radiance hot. And therefore, thuswise must an object too Be kindled \
by a thunderbolt, if haply 'Thas been adapt and suited to the flames. Yet \
force of wind must not be rashly deemed As altogether and entirely cold- That \
force which is discharged from on high With such stupendous power; but if \
'tis not Upon its course already kindled with fire, It yet arriveth warmed \
and mixed with heat. And, now, the speed and stroke of thunderbolt Is so \
tremendous, and with glide so swift Those thunderbolts rush on and down, \
because Their roused force itself collects itself First always in the clouds, \
and then prepares For the huge effort of their going-forth; Next, when the \
cloud no longer can retain The increment of their fierce impetus, Their force \
is pressed out, and therefore flies With impetus so wondrous, like to shots \
Hurled from the powerful Roman catapults. Note, too, this force consists of \
elements Both small and smooth, nor is there aught that can With ease resist \
such nature. For it darts Between and enters through the pores of things; And \
so it never falters in delay Despite innumerable collisions, but Flies \
shooting onward with a swift elan. Next, since by nature always every weight \
Bears downward, doubled is the swiftness then And that elan is still more \
wild and dread, When, verily, to weight are added blows, So that more madly \
and more fiercely then The thunderbolt shakes into shivers all That blocks \
its path, following on its way. Then, too, because it comes along, along With \
one continuing elan, it must Take on velocity anew, anew, Which still \
increases as it goes, and ever Augments the bolt's vast powers and to the \
blow Gives larger vigour; for it forces all, All of the thunder's seeds of \
fire, to sweep In a straight line unto one place, as 'twere,- Casting them \
one by other, as they roll, Into that onward course. Again, perchance, In \
coming along, it pulls from out the air Some certain bodies, which by their \
own blows Enkindle its velocity. And, lo, It comes through objects leaving \
them unharmed, It goes through many things and leaves them whole, Because the \
liquid fire flieth along Athrough their pores. And much it does transfix, \
When these primordial atoms of the bolt Have fallen upon the atoms of these \
things Precisely where the intertwined atoms Are held together. And, further, \
easily Brass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold, Because its force is so \
minutely made Of tiny parts and elements so smooth That easily they wind \
their way within, And, when once in, quickly unbind all knots And loosen all \
the bonds of union there. And most in autumn is shaken the house of heaven, \
The house so studded with the glittering stars, And the whole earth around- \
most too in spring When flowery times unfold themselves: for, lo, In the cold \
season is there lack of fire, And winds are scanty in the hot, and clouds \
Have not so dense a bulk. But when, indeed, The seasons of heaven are betwixt \
these twain, The divers causes of the thunderbolt Then all concur; for then \
both cold and heat Are mixed in the cross-seas of the year, So that a discord \
rises among things And air in vast tumultuosity Billows, infuriate with the \
fires and winds- Of which the both are needed by the cloud For fabrication of \
the thunderbolt. For the first part of heat and last of cold Is the time of \
spring; wherefore must things unlike Do battle one with other, and, when \
mixed, Tumultuously rage. And when rolls round The latest heat mixed with the \
earliest chill- The time which bears the name of autumn- then Likewise fierce \
cold-spells wrestle with fierce heats. On this account these seasons of the \
year Are nominated \"cross-seas.\"- And no marvel If in those times the \
thunderbolts prevail And storms are roused turbulent in heaven, Since then \
both sides in dubious warfare rage Tumultuously, the one with flames, the \
other With winds and with waters mixed with winds. This, this it is, O \
Memmius, to see through The very nature of fire-fraught thunderbolt; O this \
it is to mark by what blind force It maketh each effect, and not, O not To \
unwind Etrurian scrolls oracular, Inquiring tokens of occult will of gods, \
Even as to whence the flying flame hath come, Or to which half of heaven it \
turns, or how Through walled places it hath wound its way, Or, after proving \
its dominion there, How it hath speeded forth from thence amain, Or what the \
thunderstroke portends of ill From out high heaven. But if Jupiter And other \
gods shake those refulgent vaults With dread reverberations and hurl fire \
Whither it pleases each, why smite they not Mortals of reckless and revolting \
crimes, That such may pant from a transpierced breast Forth flames of the red \
levin- unto men A drastic lesson?- why is rather he- O he self-conscious of \
no foul offence- Involved in flames, though innocent, and clasped Up-caught \
in skiey whirlwind and in fire? Nay, why, then, aim they at eternal wastes, \
And spend themselves in vain?- perchance, even so To exercise their arms and \
strengthen shoulders? Why suffer they the Father's javelin To be so blunted \
on the earth? And why Doth he himself allow it, nor spare the same Even for \
his enemies? O why most oft Aims he at lofty places? Why behold we Marks of \
his lightnings most on mountain tops? Then for what reason shoots he at the \
sea?- What sacrilege have waves and bulk of brine And floating fields of foam \
been guilty of? Besides, if 'tis his will that we beware Against the \
lightning-stroke, why feareth he To grant us power for to behold the shot? \
And, contrariwise, if wills he to o'erwhelm us, Quite off our guard, with \
fire, why thunders he Off in yon quarter, so that we may shun? Why rouseth he \
beforehand darkling air And the far din and rumblings? And O how Canst thou \
believe he shoots at one same time Into diverse directions? Or darest thou \
Contend that never hath it come to pass That divers strokes have happened at \
one time? But oft and often hath it come to pass, And often still it must, \
that, even as showers And rains o'er many regions fall, so too Dart many \
thunderbolts at one same time. Again, why never hurtles Jupiter A bolt upon \
the lands nor pours abroad Clap upon clap, when skies are cloudless all? Or, \
say, doth he, so soon as ever the clouds Have come thereunder, then into the \
same Descend in person, that from thence he may Near-by decide upon the \
stroke of shaft? And, lastly, why, with devastating bolt Shakes he asunder \
holy shrines of gods And his own thrones of splendour, and to-breaks The \
well-wrought idols of divinities, And robs of glory his own images By wound \
of violence? But to return apace, Easy it is from these same facts to know In \
just what wise those things (which from their sort The Greeks have named \
\"bellows\") do come down, Discharged from on high, upon the seas. For it \
haps that sometimes from the sky descends Upon the seas a column, as if \
pushed, Round which the surges seethe, tremendously Aroused by puffing gusts; \
and whatso'er Of ships are caught within that tumult then Come into extreme \
peril, dashed along. This haps when sometimes wind's aroused force Can't \
burst the cloud it tries to, but down-weighs That cloud, until 'tis like a \
column from sky Upon the seas pushed downward- gradually, As if a Somewhat \
from on high were shoved By fist and nether thrust of arm, and lengthened Far \
to the waves. And when the force of wind Hath rived this cloud, from out the \
cloud it rushes Down on the seas, and starts among the waves A wondrous \
seething, for the eddying whirl Descends and downward draws along with it \
That cloud of ductile body. And soon as ever 'Thas shoved unto the levels of \
the main That laden cloud, the whirl suddenly then Plunges its whole self \
into the waters there And rouses all the sea with monstrous roar, \
Constraining it to seethe. It happens too That very vortex of the wind \
involves Itself in clouds, scraping from out the air The seeds of cloud, and \
counterfeits, as 'twere, The \"bellows\" pushed from heaven. And when this \
shape Hath dropped upon the lands and burst apart, It belches forth \
immeasurable might Of whirlwind and of blast. Yet since 'tis formed At most \
but rarely, and on land the hills Must block its way, 'tis seen more oft out \
there On the broad prospect of the level main Along the free horizons. Into \
being The clouds condense, when in this upper space Of the high heaven have \
gathered suddenly, As round they flew, unnumbered particles- World's rougher \
ones, which can, though interlinked With scanty couplings, yet be fastened \
firm, The one on other caught. These particles First cause small clouds to \
form; and, thereupon, These catch the one on other and swarm in a flock And \
grow by their conjoining, and by winds Are borne along, along, until collects \
The tempest fury. Happens, too, the nearer The mountain summits neighbour to \
the sky, The more unceasingly their far crags smoke With the thick darkness \
of swart cloud, because When first the mists do form, ere ever the eyes Can \
there behold them (tenuous as they be), The carrier-winds will drive them up \
and on Unto the topmost summits of the mountain; And then at last it happens, \
when they be In vaster throng upgathered, that they can By this very \
condensation lie revealed, And that at same time they are seen to surge From \
very vertex of the mountain up Into far ether. For very fact and feeling, As \
we up-climb high mountains, proveth clear That windy are those upward regions \
free. Besides, the clothes hung-out along the shore, When in they take the \
clinging moisture, prove That nature lifts from over all the sea Unnumbered \
particles. Whereby the more 'Tis manifest that many particles Even from the \
salt upheavings of the main Can rise together to augment the bulk Of massed \
clouds. For moistures in these twain Are near akin. Besides, from out all \
rivers, As well as from the land itself, we see Up-rising mists and steam, \
which like a breath Are forced out from them and borne aloft, To curtain \
heaven with their murk, and make, By slow foregathering, the skiey clouds. \
For, in addition, lo, the heat on high Of constellated ether burdens down \
Upon them, and by sort of condensation Weaveth beneath the azure firmament \
The reek of darkling cloud. It happens, too, That hither to the skies from \
the Beyond Do come those particles which make the clouds And flying \
thunderheads. For I have taught That this their number is innumerable And \
infinite the sum of the Abyss, And I have shown with what stupendous speed \
Those bodies fly and how they're wont to pass Amain through incommunicable \
space. Therefore, 'tis not exceeding strange, if oft In little time tempest \
and darkness cover With bulking thunderheads hanging on high The oceans and \
the lands, since everywhere Through all the narrow tubes of yonder ether, \
Yea, so to speak, through all the breathing-holes Of the great upper-world \
encompassing, There be for the primordial elements Exits and entrances. Now \
come, and how The rainy moisture thickens into being In the lofty clouds, and \
how upon the lands 'Tis then discharged in down-pour of large showers, I will \
unfold. And first triumphantly Will I persuade thee that up-rise together, \
With clouds themselves, full many seeds of water From out all things, and \
that they both increase- Both clouds and water which is in the clouds- In \
like proportion, as our frames increase In like proportion with our blood, as \
well As sweat or any moisture in our members. Besides, the clouds take in \
from time to time Much moisture risen from the broad marine,- Whilst the \
winds bear them o'er the mighty sea, Like hanging fleeces of white wool. \
Thuswise, Even from all rivers is there lifted up Moisture into the clouds. \
And when therein The seeds of water so many in many ways Have come together, \
augmented from all sides, The close-jammed clouds then struggle to discharge \
Their rain-storms for a two-fold reason: lo, The wind's force crowds them, \
and the very excess Of storm-clouds (massed in a vaster throng) Giveth an \
urge and pressure from above And makes the rains out-pour. Besides when, too, \
The clouds are winnowed by the winds, or scattered Smitten on top by heat of \
sun, they send Their rainy moisture, and distil their drops, Even as the wax, \
by fiery warmth on top, Wasteth and liquefies abundantly. But comes the \
violence of the bigger rains When violently the clouds are weighted down Both \
by their cumulated mass and by The onset of the wind. And rains are wont To \
endure awhile and to abide for long, When many seeds of waters are aroused, \
And clouds on clouds and racks on racks outstream In piled layers and are \
borne along From every quarter, and when all the earth Smoking exhales her \
moisture. At such a time When sun with beams amid the tempest-murk Hath shone \
against the showers of black rains, Then in the swart clouds there emerges \
bright The radiance of the bow. And as to things Not mentioned here which of \
themselves do grow Or of themselves are gendered, and all things Which in the \
clouds condense to being- all, Snow and the winds, hail and the hoar-frosts \
chill, And freezing, mighty force- of lakes and pools The mighty hardener, \
and mighty check Which in the winter curbeth everywhere The rivers as they \
go- 'tis easy still, Soon to discover and with mind to see How they all \
happen, whereby gendered, When once thou well hast understood just what \
Functions have been vouchsafed from of old Unto the procreant atoms of the \
world. Now come, and what the law of earthquakes is Hearken, and first of all \
take care to know That the under-earth, like to the earth around us, Is full \
of windy caverns all about; And many a pool and many a grim abyss She bears \
within her bosom, ay, and cliffs And jagged scarps; and many a river, hid \
Beneath her chine, rolls rapidly along Its billows and plunging boulders. For \
clear fact Requires that earth must be in every part Alike in constitution. \
Therefore, earth, With these things underneath affixed and set, Trembleth \
above, jarred by big down-tumblings, When time hath undermined the huge \
caves, The subterranean. Yea, whole mountains fall, And instantly from spot \
of that big jar There quiver the tremors far and wide abroad. And with good \
reason: since houses on the street Begin to quake throughout, when jarred by \
a cart Of no large weight; and, too, the furniture Within the house \
up-bounds, when a paving-block Gives either iron rim of the wheels a jolt. It \
happens, too, when some prodigious bulk Of age-worn soil is rolled from \
mountain slopes Into tremendous pools of water dark, That the reeling land \
itself is rocked about By the water's undulations; as a basin Sometimes won't \
come to rest until the fluid Within it ceases to be rocked about In random \
undulations. And besides, When subterranean winds, up-gathered there In the \
hollow deeps, bulk forward from one spot, And press with the big urge of \
mighty powers Against the lofty grottos, then the earth Bulks to that quarter \
whither push amain The headlong winds. Then all the builded houses Above \
ground- and the more, the higher up-reared Unto the sky- lean ominously, \
careening Into the same direction; and the beams, Wrenched forward, \
over-hang, ready to go. Yet dread men to believe that there awaits The nature \
of the mighty world a time Of doom and cataclysm, albeit they see So great a \
bulk of lands to bulge and break! And lest the winds blew back again, no \
force Could rein things in nor hold from sure career On to disaster. But now \
because those winds Blow back and forth in alternation strong, And, so to \
say, rallying charge again, And then repulsed retreat, on this account Earth \
oftener threatens than she brings to pass Collapses dire. For to one side she \
leans, Then back she sways; and after tottering Forward, recovers then her \
seats of poise. Thus, this is why whole houses rock, the roofs More than the \
middle stories, middle more Than lowest, and the lowest least of all. Arises, \
too, this same great earth-quaking, When wind and some prodigious force of \
air, Collected from without or down within The old telluric deeps, have \
hurled themselves Amain into those caverns sub-terrene, And there at first \
tumultuously chafe Among the vasty grottos, borne about In mad rotations, \
till their lashed force Aroused out-bursts abroad, and then and there, Riving \
the deep earth, makes a mighty chasm- What once in Syrian Sidon did befall, \
And once in Peloponnesian Aegium, Twain cities which such out-break of wild \
air And earth's convulsion, following hard upon, O'erthrew of old. And many a \
walled town, Besides, hath fall'n by such omnipotent Convulsions on the land, \
and in the sea Engulfed hath sunken many a city down With all its populace. \
But if, indeed, They burst not forth, yet is the very rush Of the wild air \
and fury-force of wind Then dissipated, like an ague-fit, Through the \
innumerable pores of earth, To set her all a-shake- even as a chill, When it \
hath gone into our marrow-bones, Sets us convulsively, despite ourselves, \
A-shivering and a-shaking. Therefore, men With two-fold terror bustle in \
alarm Through cities to and fro: they fear the roofs Above the head; and \
underfoot they dread The caverns, lest the nature of the earth Suddenly rend \
them open, and she gape, Herself asunder, with tremendous maw, And, all \
confounded, seek to chock it full With her own ruins. Let men, then, go on \
Feigning at will that heaven and earth shall be Inviolable, entrusted \
evermore To an eternal weal: and yet at times The very force of danger here \
at hand Prods them on some side with this goad of fear- This among others- \
that the earth, withdrawn Abruptly from under their feet, be hurried down, \
Down into the abyss, and the Sum-of-Things Be following after, utterly \
fordone, Till be but wrack and wreckage of a world. EXTRAORDINARY AND \
PARADOXICAL TELLURIC PHENOMENA In chief, men marvel nature renders not Bigger \
and bigger the bulk of ocean, since So vast the down-rush of the waters be, \
And every river out of every realm Cometh thereto; and add the random rains \
And flying tempests, which spatter every sea And every land bedew; add their \
own springs: Yet all of these unto the ocean's sum Shall be but as the \
increase of a drop. Wherefore 'tis less a marvel that the sea, The mighty \
ocean, increaseth not. Besides, Sun with his heat draws off a mighty part: \
Yea, we behold that sun with burning beams To dry our garments dripping all \
with wet; And many a sea, and far out-spread beneath, Do we behold. \
Therefore, however slight The portion of wet that sun on any spot Culls from \
the level main, he still will take From off the waves in such a wide expanse \
Abundantly. Then, further, also winds, Sweeping the level waters, can bear \
off A mighty part of wet, since we behold Oft in a single night the highways \
dried By winds, and soft mud crusted o'er at dawn. Again, I've taught thee \
that the clouds bear off Much moisture too, up-taken from the reaches Of the \
mighty main, and sprinkle it about O'er all the zones, when rain is on the \
lands And winds convey the aery racks of vapour. Lastly, since earth is \
porous through her frame, And neighbours on the seas, girdling their shores, \
The water's wet must seep into the lands From briny ocean, as from lands it \
comes Into the seas. For brine is filtered off, And then the liquid stuff \
seeps back again And all re-poureth at the river-heads, Whence in fresh-water \
currents it returns Over the lands, adown the channels which Were cleft \
erstwhile and erstwhile bore along The liquid-footed floods. And now the \
cause Whereby athrough the throat of Aetna's Mount Such vast tornado-fires \
out-breathe at times, I will unfold: for with no middling might Of \
devastation the flamy tempest rose And held dominion in Sicilian fields: \
Drawing upon itself the upturned faces Of neighbouring clans, what time they \
saw afar The skiey vaults a-fume and sparkling all, And filled their bosoms \
with dread anxiety Of what new thing nature were travailing at. In these \
affairs it much behooveth thee To look both wide and deep, and far abroad To \
peer to every quarter, that thou mayst Remember how boundless is the \
Sum-of-Things, And mark how infinitely small a part Of the whole Sum is this \
one sky of ours- O not so large a part as is one man Of the whole earth. And \
plainly if thou viewest This cosmic fact, placing it square in front, And \
plainly understandest, thou wilt leave Wondering at many things. For who of \
us Wondereth if some one gets into his joints A fever, gathering head with \
fiery heat, Or any other dolorous disease Along his members? For anon the \
foot Grows blue and bulbous; often the sharp twinge Seizes the teeth, attacks \
the very eyes; Out-breaks the sacred fire, and, crawling on Over the body, \
burneth every part It seizeth on, and works its hideous way Along the frame. \
No marvel this, since, lo, Of things innumerable be seeds enough, And this \
our earth and sky do bring to us Enough of bane from whence can grow the \
strength Of maladies uncounted. Thuswise, then, We must suppose to all the \
sky and earth Are ever supplied from out the infinite All things, O all in \
stores enough whereby The shaken earth can of a sudden move, And fierce \
typhoons can over sea and lands Go tearing on, and Aetna's fires o'erflow, \
And heaven become a flame-burst. For that, too, Happens at times, and the \
celestial vaults Glow into fire, and rainy tempests rise In heavier \
congregation, when, percase, The seeds of water have foregathered thus From \
out the infinite. \"Aye, but passing huge The fiery turmoil of that \
conflagration!\" So sayst thou; well, huge many a river seems To him that \
erstwhile ne'er a larger saw; Thus, huge seems tree or man; and everything \
Which mortal sees the biggest of each class, That he imagines to be \"huge\"; \
though yet All these, with sky and land and sea to boot, Are all as nothing \
to the sum entire Of the all-Sum. But now I will unfold At last how yonder \
suddenly angered flame Out-blows abroad from vasty furnaces Aetnaean. First, \
the mountain's nature is All under-hollow, propped about, about With caverns \
of basaltic piers. And, lo, In all its grottos be there wind and air- For \
wind is made when air hath been uproused By violent agitation. When this air \
Is heated through and through, and, raging round, Hath made the earth and all \
the rocks it touches Horribly hot, and hath struck off from them Fierce fire \
of swiftest flame, it lifts itself And hurtles thus straight upwards through \
its throat Into high heav'n, and thus bears on afar Its burning blasts and \
scattereth afar Its ashes, and rolls a smoke of pitchy murk And heaveth the \
while boulders of wondrous weight- Leaving no doubt in thee that 'tis the \
air's Tumultuous power. Besides, in mighty part, The sea there at the roots \
of that same mount Breaks its old billows and sucks back its surf. And \
grottos from the sea pass in below Even to the bottom of the mountain's \
throat. Herethrough thou must admit there go... And the conditions force [the \
water and air] Deeply to penetrate from the open sea, And to out-blow abroad, \
and to up-bear Thereby the flame, and to up-cast from deeps The boulders, and \
to rear the clouds of sand. For at the top be \"bowls,\" as people there Are \
wont to name what we at Rome do call The throats and mouths. There be, \
besides, some thing Of which 'tis not enough one only cause To state- but \
rather several, whereof one Will be the true: lo, if thou shouldst espy Lying \
afar some fellow's lifeless corse, 'Twere meet to name all causes of a death, \
That cause of his death might thereby be named: For prove thou mayst he \
perished not by steel, By cold, nor even by poison nor disease, Yet somewhat \
of this sort hath come to him We know- And thus we have to say the same In \
divers cases. Toward the summer, Nile Waxeth and overfloweth the champaign, \
Unique in all the landscape, river sole Of the Aegyptians. In mid-season \
heats Often and oft he waters Aegypt o'er, Either because in summer against \
his mouths Come those northwinds which at that time of year Men name the \
Etesian blasts, and, blowing thus Upstream, retard, and, forcing back his \
waves, Fill him o'erfull and force his flow to stop. For out of doubt these \
blasts which driven be From icy constellations of the pole Are borne straight \
up the river. Comes that river From forth the sultry places down the south, \
Rising far up in midmost realm of day, Among black generations of strong men \
With sun-baked skins. 'Tis possible, besides, That a big bulk of piled sand \
may bar His mouths against his onward waves, when sea, Wild in the winds, \
tumbles the sand to inland; Whereby the river's outlet were less free, \
Likewise less headlong his descending floods. It may be, too, that in this \
season rains Are more abundant at its fountain head, Because the Etesian \
blasts of those northwinds Then urge all clouds into those inland parts. And, \
soothly, when they're thus foregathered there, Urged yonder into midmost \
realm of day, Then, crowded against the lofty mountain sides, They're massed \
and powerfully pressed. Again, Perchance, his waters wax, O far away, Among \
the Aethiopians' lofty mountains, When the all-beholding sun with thawing \
beams Drives the white snows to flow into the vales. Now come; and unto thee \
I will unfold, As to the Birdless spots and Birdless tarns, What sort of \
nature they are furnished with. First, as to name of \"birdless,\"- that \
derives From very fact, because they noxious be Unto all birds. For when \
above those spots In horizontal flight the birds have come, Forgetting to oar \
with wings, they furl their sails, And, with down-drooping of their delicate \
necks, Fall headlong into earth, if haply such The nature of the spots, or \
into water, If haply spreads thereunder Birdless tarn. Such spot's at Cumae, \
where the mountains smoke, Charged with the pungent sulphur, and increased \
With steaming springs. And such a spot there is Within the walls of Athens, \
even there On summit of Acropolis, beside Fane of Tritonian Pallas bountiful, \
Where never cawing crows can wing their course, Not even when smoke the \
altars with good gifts,- But evermore they flee- yet not from wrath Of \
Pallas, grieved at that espial old, As poets of the Greeks have sung the \
tale; But very nature of the place compels. In Syria also- as men say- a spot \
Is to be seen, where also four-foot kinds, As soon as ever they've set their \
steps within, Collapse, o'ercome by its essential power, As if there \
slaughtered to the under-gods. Lo, all these wonders work by natural law, And \
from what causes they are brought to pass The origin is manifest; so, haply, \
Let none believe that in these regions stands The gate of Orcus, nor us then \
suppose, Haply, that thence the under-gods draw down Souls to dark shores of \
Acheron- as stags, The wing-footed, are thought to draw to light, By sniffing \
nostrils, from their dusky lairs The wriggling generations of wild snakes. \
How far removed from true reason is this, Perceive thou straight; for now \
I'll try to say Somewhat about the very fact. And, first, This do I say, as \
oft I've said before: In earth are atoms of things of every sort; And know, \
these all thus rise from out the earth- Many life-giving which be good for \
food, And many which can generate disease And hasten death, O many primal \
seeds Of many things in many modes- since earth Contains them mingled and \
gives forth discrete. And we have shown before that certain things Be unto \
certain creatures suited more For ends of life, by virtue of a nature, A \
texture, and primordial shapes, unlike For kinds alike. Then too 'tis thine \
to see How many things oppressive be and foul To man, and to sensation most \
malign: Many meander miserably through ears; Many in-wind athrough the \
nostrils too, Malign and harsh when mortal draws a breath; Of not a few must \
one avoid the touch; Of not a few must one escape the sight; And some there \
be all loathsome to the taste; And many, besides, relax the languid limbs \
Along the frame, and undermine the soul In its abodes within. To certain \
trees There hath been given so dolorous a shade That often they gender \
achings of the head, If one but be beneath, outstretched on the sward. There \
is, again, on Helicon's high hills A tree that's wont to kill a man outright \
By fetid odour of its very flower. And when the pungent stench of the \
night-lamp, Extinguished but a moment since, assails The nostrils, then and \
there it puts to sleep A man afflicted with the falling sickness And foamings \
at the mouth. A woman, too, At the heavy castor drowses back in chair, And \
from her delicate fingers slips away Her gaudy handiwork, if haply she Hath \
got the whiff at menstruation-time. Once more, if thou delayest in hot baths, \
When thou art over-full, how readily From stool in middle of the steaming \
water Thou tumblest in a fit! How readily The heavy fumes of charcoal wind \
their way Into the brain, unless beforehand we Of water 've drunk. But when a \
burning fever, O'ermastering man, hath seized upon his limbs, Then odour of \
wine is like a hammer-blow. And seest thou not how in the very earth Sulphur \
is gendered and bitumen thickens With noisome stench?- What direful stenches, \
too, Scaptensula out-breathes from down below, When men pursue the veins of \
silver and gold, With pick-axe probing round the hidden realms Deep in the \
earth?- Or what of deadly bane The mines of gold exhale? O what a look, And \
what a ghastly hue they give to men! And seest thou not, or hearest, how \
they're wont In little time to perish, and how fail The life-stores in those \
folk whom mighty power Of grim necessity confineth there In such a task? \
Thus, this telluric earth Out-streams with all these dread effluvia And \
breathes them out into the open world And into the visible regions under \
heaven. Thus, too, those Birdless places must up-send An essence bearing \
death to winged things, Which from the earth rises into the breezes To poison \
part of skiey space, and when Thither the winged is on pennons borne, There, \
seized by the unseen poison, 'tis ensnared, And from the horizontal of its \
flight Drops to the spot whence sprang the effluvium. And when 'thas there \
collapsed, then the same power Of that effluvium takes from all its limbs The \
relics of its life. That power first strikes The creatures with a wildering \
dizziness, And then thereafter, when they're once down-fallen Into the \
poison's very fountains, then Life, too, they vomit out perforce, because So \
thick the stores of bane around them fume. Again, at times it happens that \
this power, This exhalation of the Birdless places, Dispels the air betwixt \
the ground and birds, Leaving well-nigh a void. And thither when In \
horizontal flight the birds have come, Forthwith their buoyancy of pennons \
limps, All useless, and each effort of both wings Falls out in vain. Here, \
when without all power To buoy themselves and on their wings to lean, Lo, \
nature constrains them by their weight to slip Down to the earth, and lying \
prostrate there Along the well-nigh empty void, they spend Their souls \
through all the openings of their frame. Further, the water of wells is \
colder then At summer time, because the earth by heat Is rarefied, and sends \
abroad in air Whatever seeds it peradventure have Of its own fiery \
exhalations. The more, then, the telluric ground is drained Of heat, the \
colder grows the water hid Within the earth. Further, when all the earth Is \
by the cold compressed, and thus contracts And, so to say, concretes, it \
happens, lo, That by contracting it expresses then Into the wells what heat \
it bears itself. 'Tis said at Hammon's fane a fountain is, In daylight cold \
and hot in time of night. This fountain men be-wonder over-much, And think \
that suddenly it seethes in heat By intense sun, the subterranean, when Night \
with her terrible murk hath cloaked the lands- What's not true reasoning by a \
long remove: I' faith when sun o'erhead, touching with beams An open body of \
water, had no power To render it hot upon its upper side, Though his high \
light possess such burning glare, How, then, can he, when under the gross \
earth, Make water boil and glut with fiery heat?- And, specially, since \
scarcely potent he Through hedging walls of houses to inject His exhalations \
hot, with ardent rays. What, then's, the principle? Why, this, indeed: The \
earth about that spring is porous more Than elsewhere the telluric ground, \
and be Many the seeds of fire hard by the water; On this account, when night \
with dew-fraught shades Hath whelmed the earth, anon the earth deep down \
Grows chill, contracts; and thuswise squeezes out Into the spring what seeds \
she holds of fire (As one might squeeze with fist), which render hot The \
touch and steam of the fluid. Next, when sun, Up-risen, with his rays has \
split the soil And rarefied the earth with waxing heat, Again into their \
ancient abodes return The seeds of fire, and all the Hot of water Into the \
earth retires; and this is why The fountain in the daylight gets so cold. \
Besides, the water's wet is beat upon By rays of sun, and, with the dawn, \
becomes Rarer in texture under his pulsing blaze; And, therefore, whatso \
seeds it holds of fire It renders up, even as it renders oft The frost that \
it contains within itself And thaws its ice and looseneth the knots. There \
is, moreover, a fountain cold in kind That makes a bit of tow (above it held) \
Take fire forthwith and shoot a flame; so, too, A pitch-pine torch will \
kindle and flare round Along its waves, wherever 'tis impelled Afloat before \
the breeze. No marvel, this: Because full many seeds of heat there be Within \
the water; and, from earth itself Out of the deeps must particles of fire \
Athrough the entire fountain surge aloft, And speed in exhalations into air \
Forth and abroad (yet not in numbers enow As to make hot the fountain). And, \
moreo'er, Some force constrains them, scattered through the water, Forthwith \
to burst abroad, and to combine In flame above. Even as a fountain far There \
is at Aradus amid the sea, Which bubbles out sweet water and disparts From \
round itself the salt waves; and, behold, In many another region the broad \
main Yields to the thirsty mariners timely help, Belching sweet waters forth \
amid salt waves. Just so, then, can those seeds of fire burst forth Athrough \
that other fount, and bubble out Abroad against the bit of tow; and when They \
there collect or cleave unto the torch, Forthwith they readily flash aflame, \
because The tow and torches, also, in themselves Have many seeds of latent \
fire. Indeed, And seest thou not, when near the nightly lamps Thou bringest a \
flaxen wick, extinguished A moment since, it catches fire before 'Thas \
touched the flame, and in same wise a torch? And many another object flashes \
aflame When at a distance, touched by heat alone, Before 'tis steeped in \
veritable fire. This, then, we must suppose to come to pass In that spring \
also. Now to other things! And I'll begin to treat by what decree Of nature \
it came to pass that iron can be By that stone drawn which Greeks the magnet \
call After the country's name (its origin Being in country of Magnesian \
folk). This stone men marvel at; and sure it oft Maketh a chain of rings, \
depending, lo, From off itself! Nay, thou mayest see at times Five or yet \
more in order dangling down And swaying in the delicate winds, whilst one \
Depends from other, cleaving to under-side, And ilk one feels the stone's own \
power and bonds- So over-masteringly its power flows down. In things of this \
sort, much must be made sure Ere thou account of the thing itself canst give, \
And the approaches roundabout must be; Wherefore the more do I exact of thee \
A mind and ears attent. First, from all things We see soever, evermore must \
flow, Must be discharged and strewn about, about, Bodies that strike the \
eyes, awaking sight. From certain things flow odours evermore, As cold from \
rivers, heat from sun, and spray From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls \
Along the coasts. Nor ever cease to seep The varied echoings athrough the \
air. Then, too, there comes into the mouth at times The wet of a salt taste, \
when by the sea We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch The wormwood being \
mixed, its bitter stings. To such degree from all things is each thing Borne \
streamingly along, and sent about To every region round; and nature grants \
Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow, Since 'tis incessantly we feeling \
have, And all the time are suffered to descry And smell all things at hand, \
and hear them sound. Now will I seek again to bring to mind How porous a body \
all things have- a fact Made manifest in my first canto, too. For, truly, \
though to know this doth import For many things, yet for this very thing On \
which straightway I'm going to discourse, 'Tis needful most of all to make it \
sure That naught's at hand but body mixed with void. A first ensample: in \
grottos, rocks o'erhead Sweat moisture and distil the oozy drops; Likewise, \
from all our body seeps the sweat; There grows the beard, and along our \
members all And along our frame the hairs. Through all our veins Disseminates \
the foods, and gives increase And aliment down to the extreme parts, Even to \
the tiniest finger-nails. Likewise, Through solid bronze the cold and fiery \
heat We feel to pass; likewise, we feel them pass Through gold, through \
silver, when we clasp in hand The brimming goblets. And, again, there flit \
Voices through houses' hedging walls of stone; Odour seeps through, and cold, \
and heat of fire That's wont to penetrate even strength of iron. Again, where \
corselet of the sky girds round And at same time, some Influence of bane, \
When from Beyond 'thas stolen into [our world]. And tempests, gathering from \
the earth and sky, Back to the sky and earth absorbed retire- With reason, \
since there's naught that's fashioned not With body porous. Furthermore, not \
all The particles which be from things thrown off Are furnished with same \
qualities for sense, Nor be for all things equally adapt. A first ensample: \
the sun doth bake and parch The earth; but ice he thaws, and with his beams \
Compels the lofty snows, up-reared white Upon the lofty hills, to waste away; \
Then, wax, if set beneath the heat of him, Melts to a liquid. And the fire, \
likewise, Will melt the copper and will fuse the gold, But hides and flesh it \
shrivels up and shrinks. The water hardens the iron just off the fire, But \
hides and flesh (made hard by heat) it softens. The oleaster-tree as much \
delights The bearded she-goats, verily as though 'Twere nectar-steeped and \
shed ambrosia; Than which is naught that burgeons into leaf More bitter food \
for man. A hog draws back For marjoram oil, and every unguent fears Fierce \
poison these unto the bristled hogs, Yet unto us from time to time they seem, \
As 'twere, to give new life. But, contrariwise, Though unto us the mire be \
filth most foul, To hogs that mire doth so delightsome seem That they with \
wallowing from belly to back Are never cloyed. A point remains, besides, \
Which best it seems to tell of, ere I go To telling of the fact at hand \
itself. Since to the varied things assigned be The many pores, those pores \
must be diverse In nature one from other, and each have Its very shape, its \
own direction fixed. And so, indeed, in breathing creatures be The several \
senses, of which each takes in Unto itself, in its own fashion ever, Its own \
peculiar object. For we mark How sounds do into one place penetrate, Into \
another flavours of all juice, And savour of smell into a third. Moreover, \
One sort through rocks we see to seep, and, lo, One sort to pass through \
wood, another still Through gold, and others to go out and off Through silver \
and through glass. For we do see Through some pores form-and-look of things \
to flow, Through others heat to go, and some things still To speedier pass \
than others through same pores. Of verity, the nature of these same paths, \
Varying in many modes (as aforesaid) Because of unlike nature and warp and \
woof Of cosmic things, constrains it so to be. Wherefore, since all these \
matters now have been Established and settled well for us As premises \
prepared, for what remains 'Twill not be hard to render clear account By \
means of these, and the whole cause reveal Whereby the magnet lures the \
strength of iron. First, stream there must from off the lode-stone seeds \
Innumerable, a very tide, which smites By blows that air asunder lying \
betwixt The stone and iron. And when is emptied out This space, and a large \
place between the two Is made a void, forthwith the primal germs Of iron, \
headlong slipping, fall conjoined Into the vacuum, and the ring itself By \
reason thereof doth follow after and go Thuswise with all its body. And \
naught there is That of its own primordial elements More thoroughly knit or \
tighter linked coheres Than nature and cold roughness of stout iron. \
Wherefore, 'tis less a marvel what I said, That from such elements no bodies \
can From out the iron collect in larger throng And be into the vacuum borne \
along, Without the ring itself do follow after. And this it does, and \
followeth on until 'Thath reached the stone itself and cleaved to it By links \
invisible. Moreover, likewise, The motion's assisted by a thing of aid \
(Whereby the process easier becomes),- Namely, by this: as soon as rarer \
grows That air in front of the ring, and space between Is emptied more and \
made a void, forthwith It happens all the air that lies behind Conveys it \
onward, pushing from the rear. For ever doth the circumambient air Drub \
things unmoved, but here it pushes forth The iron, because upon one side the \
space Lies void and thus receives the iron in. This air, whereof I am \
reminding thee, Winding athrough the iron's abundant pores So subtly into the \
tiny parts thereof, Shoves it and pushes, as wind the ship and sails. The \
same doth happen in all directions forth: From whatso side a space is made a \
void, Whether from crosswise or above, forthwith The neighbour particles are \
borne along Into the vacuum; for of verity, They're set a-going by poundings \
from elsewhere, Nor by themselves of own accord can they Rise upwards into \
the air. Again, all things Must in their framework hold some air, because \
They are of framework porous, and the air Encompasses and borders on all \
things. Thus, then, this air in iron so deeply stored Is tossed evermore in \
vexed motion, And therefore drubs upon the ring sans doubt And shakes it up \
inside.... In sooth, that ring is thither borne along To where 'thas once \
plunged headlong- thither, lo, Unto the void whereto it took its start. It \
happens, too, at times that nature of iron Shrinks from this stone away, \
accustomed By turns to flee and follow. Yea, I've seen Those Samothracian \
iron rings leap up, And iron filings in the brazen bowls Seethe furiously, \
when underneath was set The magnet stone. So strongly iron seems To crave to \
flee that rock. Such discord great Is gendered by the interposed brass, \
Because, forsooth, when first the tide of brass Hath seized upon and held \
possession of The iron's open passage-ways, thereafter Cometh the tide of the \
stone, and in that iron Findeth all spaces full, nor now hath holes To swim \
through, as before. 'Tis thus constrained With its own current 'gainst the \
iron's fabric To dash and beat; by means whereof it spues Forth from itself- \
and through the brass stirs up- The things which otherwise without the brass \
It sucks into itself. In these affairs Marvel thou not that from this stone \
the tide Prevails not likewise other things to move With its own blows: for \
some stand firm by weight, As gold; and some cannot be moved forever, Because \
so porous in their framework they That there the tide streams through without \
a break, Of which sort stuff of wood is seen to be. Therefore, when iron \
(which lies between the two) Hath taken in some atoms of the brass, Then do \
the streams of that Magnesian rock Move iron by their smitings. Yet these \
things Are not so alien from others, that I Of this same sort am ill prepared \
to name Ensamples still of things exclusively To one another adapt. Thou \
seest, first, How lime alone cementeth stones: how wood Only by glue-of-bull \
with wood is joined- So firmly too that oftener the boards Crack open along \
the weakness of the grain Ere ever those taurine bonds will lax their hold. \
The vine-born juices with the water-springs Are bold to mix, though not the \
heavy pitch With the light oil-of-olive. And purple dye Of shell-fish so \
uniteth with the wool's Body alone that it cannot be ta'en Away forever- nay, \
though thou gavest toil To restore the same with the Neptunian flood, Nay, \
though all ocean willed to wash it out With all its waves. Again, gold unto \
gold Doth not one substance bind, and only one? And is not brass by tin \
joined unto brass? And other ensamples how many might one find! What then? \
Nor is there unto thee a need Of such long ways and roundabout, nor boots it \
For me much toil on this to spend. More fit It is in few words briefly to \
embrace Things many: things whose textures fall together So mutually adapt, \
that cavities To solids correspond, these cavities Of this thing to the solid \
parts of that, And those of that to solid parts of this- Such joinings are \
the best. Again, some things Can be the one with other coupled and held, \
Linked by hooks and eyes, as 'twere; and this Seems more the fact with iron \
and this stone. Now, of diseases what the law, and whence The Influence of \
bane upgathering can Upon the race of man and herds of cattle Kindle a \
devastation fraught with death, I will unfold. And, first, I've taught above \
That seeds there be of many things to us Life-giving, and that, contrariwise, \
there must Fly many round bringing disease and death. When these have, haply, \
chanced to collect And to derange the atmosphere of earth, The air becometh \
baneful. And, lo, all That Influence of bane, that pestilence, Or from Beyond \
down through our atmosphere, Like clouds and mists, descends, or else \
collects From earth herself and rises, when, a-soak And beat by rains \
unseasonable and suns, Our earth hath then contracted stench and rot. Seest \
thou not, also, that whoso arrive In region far from fatherland and home Are \
by the strangeness of the clime and waters Distempered?- since conditions \
vary much. For in what else may we suppose the clime Among the Britons to \
differ from Aegypt's own (Where totters awry the axis of the world), Or in \
what else to differ Pontic clime From Gades' and from climes adown the south, \
On to black generations of strong men With sun-baked skins? Even as we thus \
do see Four climes diverse under the four main-winds And under the four \
main-regions of the sky, So, too, are seen the colour and face of men Vastly \
to disagree, and fixed diseases To seize the generations, kind by kind: There \
is the elephant-disease which down In midmost Aegypt, hard by streams of \
Nile, Engendered is- and never otherwhere. In Attica the feet are oft \
attacked, And in Achaean lands the eyes. And so The divers spots to divers \
parts and limbs Are noxious; 'tis a variable air That causes this. Thus when \
an atmosphere, Alien by chance to us, begins to heave, And noxious airs begin \
to crawl along, They creep and wind like unto mist and cloud, Slowly, and \
everything upon their way They disarrange and force to change its state. It \
happens, too, that when they've come at last Into this atmosphere of ours, \
they taint And make it like themselves and alien. Therefore, asudden this \
devastation strange, This pestilence, upon the waters falls, Or settles on \
the very crops of grain Or other meat of men and feed of flocks. Or it \
remains a subtle force, suspense In the atmosphere itself; and when therefrom \
We draw our inhalations of mixed air, Into our body equally its bane Also we \
must suck in. In manner like, Oft comes the pestilence upon the kine, And \
sickness, too, upon the sluggish sheep. Nor aught it matters whether journey \
we To regions adverse to ourselves and change The atmospheric cloak, or \
whether nature Herself import a tainted atmosphere To us or something strange \
to our own use Which can attack us soon as ever it come. THE PLAGUE ATHENS \
'Twas such a manner of disease, 'twas such Mortal miasma in Cecropian lands \
Whilom reduced the plains to dead men's bones, Unpeopled the highways, \
drained of citizens The Athenian town. For coming from afar, Rising in lands \
of Aegypt, traversing Reaches of air and floating fields of foam, At last on \
all Pandion's folk it swooped; Whereat by troops unto disease and death Were \
they o'er-given. At first, they'd bear about A skull on fire with heat, and \
eyeballs twain Red with suffusion of blank glare. Their throats, Black on the \
inside, sweated oozy blood; And the walled pathway of the voice of man Was \
clogged with ulcers; and the very tongue, The mind's interpreter, would \
trickle gore, Weakened by torments, tardy, rough to touch. Next when that \
Influence of bane had chocked, Down through the throat, the breast, and \
streamed had E'en into sullen heart of those sick folk, Then, verily, all the \
fences of man's life Began to topple. From the mouth the breath Would roll a \
noisome stink, as stink to heaven Rotting cadavers flung unburied out. And, \
lo, thereafter, all the body's strength And every power of mind would \
languish, now In very doorway of destruction. And anxious anguish and \
ululation (mixed With many a groan) companioned alway The intolerable \
torments. Night and day, Recurrent spasms of vomiting would rack Alway their \
thews and members, breaking down With sheer exhaustion men already spent. And \
yet on no one's body couldst thou mark The skin with o'er-much heat to burn \
aglow, But rather the body unto touch of hands Would offer a warmish feeling, \
and thereby Show red all over, with ulcers, so to say, Inbranded, like the \
\"sacred fires\" o'erspread Along the members. The inward parts of men, In \
truth, would blaze unto the very bones; A flame, like flame in furnaces, \
would blaze Within the stomach. Nor couldst aught apply Unto their members \
light enough and thin For shift of aid- but coolness and a breeze Ever and \
ever. Some would plunge those limbs On fire with bane into the icy streams, \
Hurling the body naked into the waves; Many would headlong fling them deeply \
down The water-pits, tumbling with eager mouth Already agape. The insatiable \
thirst That whelmed their parched bodies, lo, would make A goodly shower seem \
like to scanty drops. Respite of torment was there none. Their frames \
Forspent lay prone. With silent lips of fear Would Medicine mumble low, the \
while she saw So many a time men roll their eyeballs round, Staring \
wide-open, unvisited of sleep, The heralds of old death. And in those months \
Was given many another sign of death: The intellect of mind by sorrow and \
dread Deranged, the sad brow, the countenance Fierce and delirious, the \
tormented ears Beset with ringings, the breath quick and short Or huge and \
intermittent, soaking sweat A-glisten on neck, the spittle in fine gouts \
Tainted with colour of crocus and so salt, The cough scarce wheezing through \
the rattling throat. Aye, and the sinews in the fingered hands Were sure to \
contract, and sure the jointed frame To shiver, and up from feet the cold to \
mount Inch after inch: and toward the supreme hour At last the pinched \
nostrils, nose's tip A very point, eyes sunken, temples hollow, Skin cold and \
hard, the shuddering grimace, The pulled and puffy flesh above the brows!- O \
not long after would their frames lie prone In rigid death. And by about the \
eighth Resplendent light of sun, or at the most On the ninth flaming of his \
flambeau, they Would render up the life. If any then Had 'scaped the doom of \
that destruction, yet Him there awaited in the after days A wasting and a \
death from ulcers vile And black discharges of the belly, or else Through the \
clogged nostrils would there ooze along Much fouled blood, oft with an aching \
head: Hither would stream a man's whole strength and flesh. And whoso had \
survived that virulent flow Of the vile blood, yet into thews of him And into \
his joints and very genitals Would pass the old disease. And some there were, \
Dreading the doorways of destruction So much, lived on, deprived by the knife \
Of the male member; not a few, though lopped Of hands and feet, would yet \
persist in life, And some there were who lost their eyeballs: O So fierce a \
fear of death had fallen on them! And some, besides, were by oblivion Of all \
things seized, that even themselves they knew No longer. And though corpse on \
corpse lay piled Unburied on ground, the race of birds and beasts Would or \
spring back, scurrying to escape The virulent stench, or, if they'd tasted \
there, Would languish in approaching death. But yet Hardly at all during \
those many suns Appeared a fowl, nor from the woods went forth The sullen \
generations of wild beasts- They languished with disease and died and died. \
In chief, the faithful dogs, in all the streets Outstretched, would yield \
their breath distressfully For so that Influence of bane would twist Life \
from their members. Nor was found one sure And universal principle of cure: \
For what to one had given the power to take The vital winds of air into his \
mouth, And to gaze upward at the vaults of sky, The same to others was their \
death and doom. In those affairs, O awfullest of all, O pitiable most was \
this, was this: Whoso once saw himself in that disease Entangled, ay, as \
damned unto death, Would lie in wanhope, with a sullen heart, Would, in \
fore-vision of his funeral, Give up the ghost, O then and there. For, lo, At \
no time did they cease one from another To catch contagion of the greedy \
plague,- As though but woolly flocks and horned herds; And this in chief \
would heap the dead on dead: For who forbore to look to their own sick, O \
these (too eager of life, of death afeard) Would then, soon after, \
slaughtering Neglect Visit with vengeance of evil death and base- Themselves \
deserted and forlorn of help. But who had stayed at hand would perish there \
By that contagion and the toil which then A sense of honour and the pleading \
voice Of weary watchers, mixed with voice of wail Of dying folk, forced them \
to undergo. This kind of death each nobler soul would meet. The funerals, \
uncompanioned, forsaken, Like rivals contended to be hurried through. And men \
contending to ensepulchre Pile upon pile the throng of their own dead: And \
weary with woe and weeping wandered home; And then the most would take to bed \
from grief. Nor could be found not one, whom nor disease Nor death, nor woe \
had not in those dread times Attacked. By now the shepherds and neatherds \
all, Yea, even the sturdy guiders of curved ploughs, Began to sicken, and \
their bodies would lie Huddled within back-corners of their huts, Delivered \
by squalor and disease to death. O often and often couldst thou then have \
seen On lifeless children lifeless parents prone, Or offspring on their \
fathers', mothers' corpse Yielding the life. And into the city poured O not \
in least part from the countryside That tribulation, which the peasantry \
Sick, sick, brought thither, thronging from every quarter, Plague-stricken \
mob. All places would they crowd, All buildings too; whereby the more would \
death Up-pile a-heap the folk so crammed in town. Ah, many a body thirst had \
dragged and rolled Along the highways there was lying strewn Besides \
Silenus-headed water-fountains,- The life-breath choked from that too dear \
desire Of pleasant waters. Ah, everywhere along The open places of the \
populace, And along the highways, O thou mightest see Of many a half-dead \
body the sagged limbs, Rough with squalor, wrapped around with rags, Perish \
from very nastiness, with naught But skin upon the bones, well-nigh already \
Buried- in ulcers vile and obscene filth. All holy temples, too, of deities \
Had Death becrammed with the carcasses; And stood each fane of the Celestial \
Ones Laden with stark cadavers everywhere- Places which warders of the \
shrines had crowded With many a guest. For now no longer men Did mightily \
esteem the old Divine, The worship of the gods: the woe at hand Did \
over-master. Nor in the city then Remained those rites of sepulture, with \
which That pious folk had evermore been wont To buried be. For it was \
wildered all In wild alarms, and each and every one With sullen sorrow would \
bury his own dead, As present shift allowed. And sudden stress And poverty to \
many an awful act Impelled; and with a monstrous screaming they Would, on the \
frames of alien funeral pyres, Place their own kin, and thrust the torch \
beneath Oft brawling with much bloodshed round about Rather than quit dead \
bodies loved in life.  PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Meno, Socrates, A Slave of \
Meno (Boy), Anytus. MENO: Can you tell me, Socrates, whether virtue is \
acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor by \
practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way? \
SOCRATES: O Meno, there was a time when the Thessalians were famous among the \
other Hellenes only for their riches and their riding; but now, if I am not \
mistaken, they are equally famous for their wisdom, especially at Larisa, \
which is the native city of your friend Aristippus. And this is Gorgias' \
doing; for when he came there, the flower of the Aleuadae, among them your \
admirer Aristippus, and the other chiefs of the Thessalians, fell in love \
with his wisdom. And he has taught you the habit of answering questions in a \
grand and bold style, which becomes those who know, and is the style in which \
he himself answers all comers; and any Hellene who likes may ask him \
anything. How different is our lot! my dear Meno. Here at Athens there is a \
dearth of the commodity, and all wisdom seems to have emigrated from us to \
you. I am certain that if you were to ask any Athenian whether virtue was \
natural or acquired, he would laugh in your face, and say: 'Stranger, you \
have far too good an opinion of me, if you think that I can answer your \
question. For I literally do not know what virtue is, and much less whether \
it is acquired by teaching or not.' And I myself, Meno, living as I do in \
this region of poverty, am as poor as the rest of the world; and I confess \
with shame that I know literally nothing about virtue; and when I do not know \
the 'quid' of anything how can I know the 'quale'? How, if I knew nothing at \
all of Meno, could I tell if he was fair, or the opposite of fair; rich and \
noble, or the reverse of rich and noble? Do you think that I could? MENO: No, \
indeed. But are you in earnest, Socrates, in saying that you do not know what \
virtue is? And am I to carry back this report of you to Thessaly? SOCRATES: \
Not only that, my dear boy, but you may say further that I have never known \
of any one else who did, in my judgment. MENO: Then you have never met \
Gorgias when he was at Athens? SOCRATES: Yes, I have. MENO: And did you not \
think that he knew? SOCRATES: I have not a good memory, Meno, and therefore I \
cannot now tell what I thought of him at the time. And I dare say that he did \
know, and that you know what he said: please, therefore, to remind me of what \
he said; or, if you would rather, tell me your own view; for I suspect that \
you and he think much alike. MENO: Very true. SOCRATES: Then as he is not \
here, never mind him, and do you tell me: By the gods, Meno, be generous, and \
tell me what you say that virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find \
that I have been mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this \
knowledge; although I have been just saying that I have never found anybody \
who had. MENO: There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering your \
question. Let us take first the virtue of a man--he should know how to \
administer the state, and in the administration of it to benefit his friends \
and harm his enemies; and he must also be careful not to suffer harm himself. \
A woman's virtue, if you wish to know about that, may also be easily \
described: her duty is to order her house, and keep what is indoors, and obey \
her husband. Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or \
female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, \
and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and \
ages of each of us in all that we do. And the same may be said of vice, \
Socrates (Compare Arist. Pol.). SOCRATES: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I \
ask you for one virtue, you present me with a swarm of them (Compare \
Theaet.), which are in your keeping. Suppose that I carry on the figure of \
the swarm, and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee? and you answer that \
there are many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ as bees, \
because there are many and different kinds of them; or are they not rather to \
be distinguished by some other quality, as for example beauty, size, or \
shape? How would you answer me? MENO: I should answer that bees do not differ \
from one another, as bees. SOCRATES: And if I went on to say: That is what I \
desire to know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not \
differ, but are all alike;--would you be able to answer? MENO: I should. \
SOCRATES: And so of the virtues, however many and different they may be, they \
have all a common nature which makes them virtues; and on this he who would \
answer the question, 'What is virtue?' would do well to have his eye fixed: \
Do you understand? MENO: I am beginning to understand; but I do not as yet \
take hold of the question as I could wish. SOCRATES: When you say, Meno, that \
there is one virtue of a man, another of a woman, another of a child, and so \
on, does this apply only to virtue, or would you say the same of health, and \
size, and strength? Or is the nature of health always the same, whether in \
man or woman? MENO: I should say that health is the same, both in man and \
woman. SOCRATES: And is not this true of size and strength? If a woman is \
strong, she will be strong by reason of the same form and of the same \
strength subsisting in her which there is in the man. I mean to say that \
strength, as strength, whether of man or woman, is the same. Is there any \
difference? MENO: I think not. SOCRATES: And will not virtue, as virtue, be \
the same, whether in a child or in a grown-up person, in a woman or in a man? \
MENO: I cannot help feeling, Socrates, that this case is different from the \
others. SOCRATES: But why? Were you not saying that the virtue of a man was \
to order a state, and the virtue of a woman was to order a house? MENO: I did \
say so. SOCRATES: And can either house or state or anything be well ordered \
without temperance and without justice? MENO: Certainly not. SOCRATES: Then \
they who order a state or a house temperately or justly order them with \
temperance and justice? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: Then both men and women, \
if they are to be good men and women, must have the same virtues of \
temperance and justice? MENO: True. SOCRATES: And can either a young man or \
an elder one be good, if they are intemperate and unjust? MENO: They cannot. \
SOCRATES: They must be temperate and just? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: Then all men \
are good in the same way, and by participation in the same virtues? MENO: \
Such is the inference. SOCRATES: And they surely would not have been good in \
the same way, unless their virtue had been the same? MENO: They would not. \
SOCRATES: Then now that the sameness of all virtue has been proven, try and \
remember what you and Gorgias say that virtue is. MENO: Will you have one \
definition of them all? SOCRATES: That is what I am seeking. MENO: If you \
want to have one definition of them all, I know not what to say, but that \
virtue is the power of governing mankind. SOCRATES: And does this definition \
of virtue include all virtue? Is virtue the same in a child and in a slave, \
Meno? Can the child govern his father, or the slave his master; and would he \
who governed be any longer a slave? MENO: I think not, Socrates. SOCRATES: \
No, indeed; there would be small reason in that. Yet once more, fair friend; \
according to you, virtue is 'the power of governing;' but do you not add \
'justly and not unjustly'? MENO: Yes, Socrates; I agree there; for justice is \
virtue. SOCRATES: Would you say 'virtue,' Meno, or 'a virtue'? MENO: What do \
you mean? SOCRATES: I mean as I might say about anything; that a round, for \
example, is 'a figure' and not simply 'figure,' and I should adopt this mode \
of speaking, because there are other figures. MENO: Quite right; and that is \
just what I am saying about virtue--that there are other virtues as well as \
justice. SOCRATES: What are they? tell me the names of them, as I would tell \
you the names of the other figures if you asked me. MENO: Courage and \
temperance and wisdom and magnanimity are virtues; and there are many others. \
SOCRATES: Yes, Meno; and again we are in the same case: in searching after \
one virtue we have found many, though not in the same way as before; but we \
have been unable to find the common virtue which runs through them all. MENO: \
Why, Socrates, even now I am not able to follow you in the attempt to get at \
one common notion of virtue as of other things. SOCRATES: No wonder; but I \
will try to get nearer if I can, for you know that all things have a common \
notion. Suppose now that some one asked you the question which I asked \
before: Meno, he would say, what is figure? And if you answered 'roundness,' \
he would reply to you, in my way of speaking, by asking whether you would say \
that roundness is 'figure' or 'a figure;' and you would answer 'a figure.' \
MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: And for this reason--that there are other figures? \
MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: And if he proceeded to ask, What other figures are \
there? you would have told him. MENO: I should. SOCRATES: And if he similarly \
asked what colour is, and you answered whiteness, and the questioner \
rejoined, Would you say that whiteness is colour or a colour? you would \
reply, A colour, because there are other colours as well. MENO: I should. \
SOCRATES: And if he had said, Tell me what they are?--you would have told him \
of other colours which are colours just as much as whiteness. MENO: Yes. \
SOCRATES: And suppose that he were to pursue the matter in my way, he would \
say: Ever and anon we are landed in particulars, but this is not what I want; \
tell me then, since you call them by a common name, and say that they are all \
figures, even when opposed to one another, what is that common nature which \
you designate as figure--which contains straight as well as round, and is no \
more one than the other--that would be your mode of speaking? MENO: Yes. \
SOCRATES: And in speaking thus, you do not mean to say that the round is \
round any more than straight, or the straight any more straight than round? \
MENO: Certainly not. SOCRATES: You only assert that the round figure is not \
more a figure than the straight, or the straight than the round? MENO: Very \
true. SOCRATES: To what then do we give the name of figure? Try and answer. \
Suppose that when a person asked you this question either about figure or \
colour, you were to reply, Man, I do not understand what you want, or know \
what you are saying; he would look rather astonished and say: Do you not \
understand that I am looking for the 'simile in multis'? And then he might \
put the question in another form: Meno, he might say, what is that 'simile in \
multis' which you call figure, and which includes not only round and straight \
figures, but all? Could you not answer that question, Meno? I wish that you \
would try; the attempt will be good practice with a view to the answer about \
virtue. MENO: I would rather that you should answer, Socrates. SOCRATES: \
Shall I indulge you? MENO: By all means. SOCRATES: And then you will tell me \
about virtue? MENO: I will. SOCRATES: Then I must do my best, for there is a \
prize to be won. MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: Well, I will try and explain to \
you what figure is. What do you say to this answer?--Figure is the only thing \
which always follows colour. Will you be satisfied with it, as I am sure that \
I should be, if you would let me have a similar definition of virtue? MENO: \
But, Socrates, it is such a simple answer. SOCRATES: Why simple? MENO: \
Because, according to you, figure is that which always follows colour. \
(SOCRATES: Granted.) MENO: But if a person were to say that he does not know \
what colour is, any more than what figure is--what sort of answer would you \
have given him? SOCRATES: I should have told him the truth. And if he were a \
philosopher of the eristic and antagonistic sort, I should say to him: You \
have my answer, and if I am wrong, your business is to take up the argument \
and refute me. But if we were friends, and were talking as you and I are now, \
I should reply in a milder strain and more in the dialectician's vein; that \
is to say, I should not only speak the truth, but I should make use of \
premisses which the person interrogated would be willing to admit. And this \
is the way in which I shall endeavour to approach you. You will acknowledge, \
will you not, that there is such a thing as an end, or termination, or \
extremity?--all which words I use in the same sense, although I am aware that \
Prodicus might draw distinctions about them: but still you, I am sure, would \
speak of a thing as ended or terminated--that is all which I am saying--not \
anything very difficult. MENO: Yes, I should; and I believe that I understand \
your meaning. SOCRATES: And you would speak of a surface and also of a solid, \
as for example in geometry. MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: Well then, you are now in a \
condition to understand my definition of figure. I define figure to be that \
in which the solid ends; or, more concisely, the limit of solid. MENO: And \
now, Socrates, what is colour? SOCRATES: You are outrageous, Meno, in thus \
plaguing a poor old man to give you an answer, when you will not take the \
trouble of remembering what is Gorgias' definition of virtue. MENO: When you \
have told me what I ask, I will tell you, Socrates. SOCRATES: A man who was \
blindfolded has only to hear you talking, and he would know that you are a \
fair creature and have still many lovers. MENO: Why do you think so? \
SOCRATES: Why, because you always speak in imperatives: like all beauties \
when they are in their prime, you are tyrannical; and also, as I suspect, you \
have found out that I have weakness for the fair, and therefore to humour you \
I must answer. MENO: Please do. SOCRATES: Would you like me to answer you \
after the manner of Gorgias, which is familiar to you? MENO: I should like \
nothing better. SOCRATES: Do not he and you and Empedocles say that there are \
certain effluences of existence? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: And passages into \
which and through which the effluences pass? MENO: Exactly. SOCRATES: And \
some of the effluences fit into the passages, and some of them are too small \
or too large? MENO: True. SOCRATES: And there is such a thing as sight? MENO: \
Yes. SOCRATES: And now, as Pindar says, 'read my meaning:'--colour is an \
effluence of form, commensurate with sight, and palpable to sense. MENO: \
That, Socrates, appears to me to be an admirable answer. SOCRATES: Why, yes, \
because it happens to be one which you have been in the habit of hearing: and \
your wit will have discovered, I suspect, that you may explain in the same \
way the nature of sound and smell, and of many other similar phenomena. MENO: \
Quite true. SOCRATES: The answer, Meno, was in the orthodox solemn vein, and \
therefore was more acceptable to you than the other answer about figure. \
MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: And yet, O son of Alexidemus, I cannot help thinking \
that the other was the better; and I am sure that you would be of the same \
opinion, if you would only stay and be initiated, and were not compelled, as \
you said yesterday, to go away before the mysteries. MENO: But I will stay, \
Socrates, if you will give me many such answers. SOCRATES: Well then, for my \
own sake as well as for yours, I will do my very best; but I am afraid that I \
shall not be able to give you very many as good: and now, in your turn, you \
are to fulfil your promise, and tell me what virtue is in the universal; and \
do not make a singular into a plural, as the facetious say of those who break \
a thing, but deliver virtue to me whole and sound, and not broken into a \
number of pieces: I have given you the pattern. MENO: Well then, Socrates, \
virtue, as I take it, is when he, who desires the honourable, is able to \
provide it for himself; so the poet says, and I say too-- 'Virtue is the \
desire of things honourable and the power of attaining them.' SOCRATES: And \
does he who desires the honourable also desire the good? MENO: Certainly. \
SOCRATES: Then are there some who desire the evil and others who desire the \
good? Do not all men, my dear sir, desire good? MENO: I think not. SOCRATES: \
There are some who desire evil? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: Do you mean that they \
think the evils which they desire, to be good; or do they know that they are \
evil and yet desire them? MENO: Both, I think. SOCRATES: And do you really \
imagine, Meno, that a man knows evils to be evils and desires them \
notwithstanding? MENO: Certainly I do. SOCRATES: And desire is of possession? \
MENO: Yes, of possession. SOCRATES: And does he think that the evils will do \
good to him who possesses them, or does he know that they will do him harm? \
MENO: There are some who think that the evils will do them good, and others \
who know that they will do them harm. SOCRATES: And, in your opinion, do \
those who think that they will do them good know that they are evils? MENO: \
Certainly not. SOCRATES: Is it not obvious that those who are ignorant of \
their nature do not desire them; but they desire what they suppose to be \
goods although they are really evils; and if they are mistaken and suppose \
the evils to be goods they really desire goods? MENO: Yes, in that case. \
SOCRATES: Well, and do those who, as you say, desire evils, and think that \
evils are hurtful to the possessor of them, know that they will be hurt by \
them? MENO: They must know it. SOCRATES: And must they not suppose that those \
who are hurt are miserable in proportion to the hurt which is inflicted upon \
them? MENO: How can it be otherwise? SOCRATES: But are not the miserable \
ill-fated? MENO: Yes, indeed. SOCRATES: And does any one desire to be \
miserable and ill-fated? MENO: I should say not, Socrates. SOCRATES: But if \
there is no one who desires to be miserable, there is no one, Meno, who \
desires evil; for what is misery but the desire and possession of evil? MENO: \
That appears to be the truth, Socrates, and I admit that nobody desires evil. \
SOCRATES: And yet, were you not saying just now that virtue is the desire and \
power of attaining good? MENO: Yes, I did say so. SOCRATES: But if this be \
affirmed, then the desire of good is common to all, and one man is no better \
than another in that respect? MENO: True. SOCRATES: And if one man is not \
better than another in desiring good, he must be better in the power of \
attaining it? MENO: Exactly. SOCRATES: Then, according to your definition, \
virtue would appear to be the power of attaining good? MENO: I entirely \
approve, Socrates, of the manner in which you now view this matter. SOCRATES: \
Then let us see whether what you say is true from another point of view; for \
very likely you may be right:--You affirm virtue to be the power of attaining \
goods? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: And the goods which you mean are such as health \
and wealth and the possession of gold and silver, and having office and \
honour in the state--those are what you would call goods? MENO: Yes, I should \
include all those. SOCRATES: Then, according to Meno, who is the hereditary \
friend of the great king, virtue is the power of getting silver and gold; and \
would you add that they must be gained piously, justly, or do you deem this \
to be of no consequence? And is any mode of acquisition, even if unjust and \
dishonest, equally to be deemed virtue? MENO: Not virtue, Socrates, but vice. \
SOCRATES: Then justice or temperance or holiness, or some other part of \
virtue, as would appear, must accompany the acquisition, and without them the \
mere acquisition of good will not be virtue. MENO: Why, how can there be \
virtue without these? SOCRATES: And the non-acquisition of gold and silver in \
a dishonest manner for oneself or another, or in other words the want of \
them, may be equally virtue? MENO: True. SOCRATES: Then the acquisition of \
such goods is no more virtue than the non-acquisition and want of them, but \
whatever is accompanied by justice or honesty is virtue, and whatever is \
devoid of justice is vice. MENO: It cannot be otherwise, in my judgment. \
SOCRATES: And were we not saying just now that justice, temperance, and the \
like, were each of them a part of virtue? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: And so, Meno, \
this is the way in which you mock me. MENO: Why do you say that, Socrates? \
SOCRATES: Why, because I asked you to deliver virtue into my hands whole and \
unbroken, and I gave you a pattern according to which you were to frame your \
answer; and you have forgotten already, and tell me that virtue is the power \
of attaining good justly, or with justice; and justice you acknowledge to be \
a part of virtue. MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: Then it follows from your own \
admissions, that virtue is doing what you do with a part of virtue; for \
justice and the like are said by you to be parts of virtue. MENO: What of \
that? SOCRATES: What of that! Why, did not I ask you to tell me the nature of \
virtue as a whole? And you are very far from telling me this; but declare \
every action to be virtue which is done with a part of virtue; as though you \
had told me and I must already know the whole of virtue, and this too when \
frittered away into little pieces. And, therefore, my dear Meno, I fear that \
I must begin again and repeat the same question: What is virtue? for \
otherwise, I can only say, that every action done with a part of virtue is \
virtue; what else is the meaning of saying that every action done with \
justice is virtue? Ought I not to ask the question over again; for can any \
one who does not know virtue know a part of virtue? MENO: No; I do not say \
that he can. SOCRATES: Do you remember how, in the example of figure, we \
rejected any answer given in terms which were as yet unexplained or \
unadmitted? MENO: Yes, Socrates; and we were quite right in doing so. \
SOCRATES: But then, my friend, do not suppose that we can explain to any one \
the nature of virtue as a whole through some unexplained portion of virtue, \
or anything at all in that fashion; we should only have to ask over again the \
old question, What is virtue? Am I not right? MENO: I believe that you are. \
SOCRATES: Then begin again, and answer me, What, according to you and your \
friend Gorgias, is the definition of virtue? MENO: O Socrates, I used to be \
told, before I knew you, that you were always doubting yourself and making \
others doubt; and now you are casting your spells over me, and I am simply \
getting bewitched and enchanted, and am at my wits' end. And if I may venture \
to make a jest upon you, you seem to me both in your appearance and in your \
power over others to be very like the flat torpedo fish, who torpifies those \
who come near him and touch him, as you have now torpified me, I think. For \
my soul and my tongue are really torpid, and I do not know how to answer you; \
and though I have been delivered of an infinite variety of speeches about \
virtue before now, and to many persons--and very good ones they were, as I \
thought--at this moment I cannot even say what virtue is. And I think that \
you are very wise in not voyaging and going away from home, for if you did in \
other places as you do in Athens, you would be cast into prison as a \
magician. SOCRATES: You are a rogue, Meno, and had all but caught me. MENO: \
What do you mean, Socrates? SOCRATES: I can tell why you made a simile about \
me. MENO: Why? SOCRATES: In order that I might make another simile about you. \
For I know that all pretty young gentlemen like to have pretty similes made \
about them--as well they may--but I shall not return the compliment. As to my \
being a torpedo, if the torpedo is torpid as well as the cause of torpidity \
in others, then indeed I am a torpedo, but not otherwise; for I perplex \
others, not because I am clear, but because I am utterly perplexed myself. \
And now I know not what virtue is, and you seem to be in the same case, \
although you did once perhaps know before you touched me. However, I have no \
objection to join with you in the enquiry. MENO: And how will you enquire, \
Socrates, into that which you do not know? What will you put forth as the \
subject of enquiry? And if you find what you want, how will you ever know \
that this is the thing which you did not know? SOCRATES: I know, Meno, what \
you mean; but just see what a tiresome dispute you are introducing. You argue \
that a man cannot enquire either about that which he knows, or about that \
which he does not know; for if he knows, he has no need to enquire; and if \
not, he cannot; for he does not know the very subject about which he is to \
enquire (Compare Aristot. Post. Anal.). MENO: Well, Socrates, and is not the \
argument sound? SOCRATES: I think not. MENO: Why not? SOCRATES: I will tell \
you why: I have heard from certain wise men and women who spoke of things \
divine that-- MENO: What did they say? SOCRATES: They spoke of a glorious \
truth, as I conceive. MENO: What was it? and who were they? SOCRATES: Some of \
them were priests and priestesses, who had studied how they might be able to \
give a reason of their profession: there have been poets also, who spoke of \
these things by inspiration, like Pindar, and many others who were inspired. \
And they say--mark, now, and see whether their words are true--they say that \
the soul of man is immortal, and at one time has an end, which is termed \
dying, and at another time is born again, but is never destroyed. And the \
moral is, that a man ought to live always in perfect holiness. 'For in the \
ninth year Persephone sends the souls of those from whom she has received the \
penalty of ancient crime back again from beneath into the light of the sun \
above, and these are they who become noble kings and mighty men and great in \
wisdom and are called saintly heroes in after ages.' The soul, then, as being \
immortal, and having been born again many times, and having seen all things \
that exist, whether in this world or in the world below, has knowledge of \
them all; and it is no wonder that she should be able to call to remembrance \
all that she ever knew about virtue, and about everything; for as all nature \
is akin, and the soul has learned all things; there is no difficulty in her \
eliciting or as men say learning, out of a single recollection all the rest, \
if a man is strenuous and does not faint; for all enquiry and all learning is \
but recollection. And therefore we ought not to listen to this sophistical \
argument about the impossibility of enquiry: for it will make us idle; and is \
sweet only to the sluggard; but the other saying will make us active and \
inquisitive. In that confiding, I will gladly enquire with you into the \
nature of virtue. MENO: Yes, Socrates; but what do you mean by saying that we \
do not learn, and that what we call learning is only a process of \
recollection? Can you teach me how this is? SOCRATES: I told you, Meno, just \
now that you were a rogue, and now you ask whether I can teach you, when I am \
saying that there is no teaching, but only recollection; and thus you imagine \
that you will involve me in a contradiction. MENO: Indeed, Socrates, I \
protest that I had no such intention. I only asked the question from habit; \
but if you can prove to me that what you say is true, I wish that you would. \
SOCRATES: It will be no easy matter, but I will try to please you to the \
utmost of my power. Suppose that you call one of your numerous attendants, \
that I may demonstrate on him. MENO: Certainly. Come hither, boy. SOCRATES: \
He is Greek, and speaks Greek, does he not? MENO: Yes, indeed; he was born in \
the house. SOCRATES: Attend now to the questions which I ask him, and observe \
whether he learns of me or only remembers. MENO: I will. SOCRATES: Tell me, \
boy, do you know that a figure like this is a square? BOY: I do. SOCRATES: \
And you know that a square figure has these four lines equal? BOY: Certainly. \
SOCRATES: And these lines which I have drawn through the middle of the square \
are also equal? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: A square may be of any size? BOY: \
Certainly. SOCRATES: And if one side of the figure be of two feet, and the \
other side be of two feet, how much will the whole be? Let me explain: if in \
one direction the space was of two feet, and in the other direction of one \
foot, the whole would be of two feet taken once? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: But \
since this side is also of two feet, there are twice two feet? BOY: There \
are. SOCRATES: Then the square is of twice two feet? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: And \
how many are twice two feet? count and tell me. BOY: Four, Socrates. \
SOCRATES: And might there not be another square twice as large as this, and \
having like this the lines equal? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: And of how many feet \
will that be? BOY: Of eight feet. SOCRATES: And now try and tell me the \
length of the line which forms the side of that double square: this is two \
feet--what will that be? BOY: Clearly, Socrates, it will be double. SOCRATES: \
Do you observe, Meno, that I am not teaching the boy anything, but only \
asking him questions; and now he fancies that he knows how long a line is \
necessary in order to produce a figure of eight square feet; does he not? \
MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: And does he really know? MENO: Certainly not. SOCRATES: \
He only guesses that because the square is double, the line is double. MENO: \
True. SOCRATES: Observe him while he recalls the steps in regular order. (To \
the Boy:) Tell me, boy, do you assert that a double space comes from a double \
line? Remember that I am not speaking of an oblong, but of a figure equal \
every way, and twice the size of this--that is to say of eight feet; and I \
want to know whether you still say that a double square comes from double \
line? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: But does not this line become doubled if we add \
another such line here? BOY: Certainly. SOCRATES: And four such lines will \
make a space containing eight feet? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: Let us describe such \
a figure: Would you not say that this is the figure of eight feet? BOY: Yes. \
SOCRATES: And are there not these four divisions in the figure, each of which \
is equal to the figure of four feet? BOY: True. SOCRATES: And is not that \
four times four? BOY: Certainly. SOCRATES: And four times is not double? BOY: \
No, indeed. SOCRATES: But how much? BOY: Four times as much. SOCRATES: \
Therefore the double line, boy, has given a space, not twice, but four times \
as much. BOY: True. SOCRATES: Four times four are sixteen--are they not? BOY: \
Yes. SOCRATES: What line would give you a space of eight feet, as this gives \
one of sixteen feet;--do you see? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: And the space of four \
feet is made from this half line? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: Good; and is not a \
space of eight feet twice the size of this, and half the size of the other? \
BOY: Certainly. SOCRATES: Such a space, then, will be made out of a line \
greater than this one, and less than that one? BOY: Yes; I think so. \
SOCRATES: Very good; I like to hear you say what you think. And now tell me, \
is not this a line of two feet and that of four? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: Then the \
line which forms the side of eight feet ought to be more than this line of \
two feet, and less than the other of four feet? BOY: It ought. SOCRATES: Try \
and see if you can tell me how much it will be. BOY: Three feet. SOCRATES: \
Then if we add a half to this line of two, that will be the line of three. \
Here are two and there is one; and on the other side, here are two also and \
there is one: and that makes the figure of which you speak? BOY: Yes. \
SOCRATES: But if there are three feet this way and three feet that way, the \
whole space will be three times three feet? BOY: That is evident. SOCRATES: \
And how much are three times three feet? BOY: Nine. SOCRATES: And how much is \
the double of four? BOY: Eight. SOCRATES: Then the figure of eight is not \
made out of a line of three? BOY: No. SOCRATES: But from what line?--tell me \
exactly; and if you would rather not reckon, try and show me the line. BOY: \
Indeed, Socrates, I do not know. SOCRATES: Do you see, Meno, what advances he \
has made in his power of recollection? He did not know at first, and he does \
not know now, what is the side of a figure of eight feet: but then he thought \
that he knew, and answered confidently as if he knew, and had no difficulty; \
now he has a difficulty, and neither knows nor fancies that he knows. MENO: \
True. SOCRATES: Is he not better off in knowing his ignorance? MENO: I think \
that he is. SOCRATES: If we have made him doubt, and given him the 'torpedo's \
shock,' have we done him any harm? MENO: I think not. SOCRATES: We have \
certainly, as would seem, assisted him in some degree to the discovery of the \
truth; and now he will wish to remedy his ignorance, but then he would have \
been ready to tell all the world again and again that the double space should \
have a double side. MENO: True. SOCRATES: But do you suppose that he would \
ever have enquired into or learned what he fancied that he knew, though he \
was really ignorant of it, until he had fallen into perplexity under the idea \
that he did not know, and had desired to know? MENO: I think not, Socrates. \
SOCRATES: Then he was the better for the torpedo's touch? MENO: I think so. \
SOCRATES: Mark now the farther development. I shall only ask him, and not \
teach him, and he shall share the enquiry with me: and do you watch and see \
if you find me telling or explaining anything to him, instead of eliciting \
his opinion. Tell me, boy, is not this a square of four feet which I have \
drawn? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: And now I add another square equal to the former \
one? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: And a third, which is equal to either of them? BOY: \
Yes. SOCRATES: Suppose that we fill up the vacant corner? BOY: Very good. \
SOCRATES: Here, then, there are four equal spaces? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: And \
how many times larger is this space than this other? BOY: Four times. \
SOCRATES: But it ought to have been twice only, as you will remember. BOY: \
True. SOCRATES: And does not this line, reaching from corner to corner, \
bisect each of these spaces? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: And are there not here four \
equal lines which contain this space? BOY: There are. SOCRATES: Look and see \
how much this space is. BOY: I do not understand. SOCRATES: Has not each \
interior line cut off half of the four spaces? BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: And how \
many spaces are there in this section? BOY: Four. SOCRATES: And how many in \
this? BOY: Two. SOCRATES: And four is how many times two? BOY: Twice. \
SOCRATES: And this space is of how many feet? BOY: Of eight feet. SOCRATES: \
And from what line do you get this figure? BOY: From this. SOCRATES: That is, \
from the line which extends from corner to corner of the figure of four feet? \
BOY: Yes. SOCRATES: And that is the line which the learned call the diagonal. \
And if this is the proper name, then you, Meno's slave, are prepared to \
affirm that the double space is the square of the diagonal? BOY: Certainly, \
Socrates. SOCRATES: What do you say of him, Meno? Were not all these answers \
given out of his own head? MENO: Yes, they were all his own. SOCRATES: And \
yet, as we were just now saying, he did not know? MENO: True. SOCRATES: But \
still he had in him those notions of his--had he not? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: \
Then he who does not know may still have true notions of that which he does \
not know? MENO: He has. SOCRATES: And at present these notions have just been \
stirred up in him, as in a dream; but if he were frequently asked the same \
questions, in different forms, he would know as well as any one at last? \
MENO: I dare say. SOCRATES: Without any one teaching him he will recover his \
knowledge for himself, if he is only asked questions? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: \
And this spontaneous recovery of knowledge in him is recollection? MENO: \
True. SOCRATES: And this knowledge which he now has must he not either have \
acquired or always possessed? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: But if he always possessed \
this knowledge he would always have known; or if he has acquired the \
knowledge he could not have acquired it in this life, unless he has been \
taught geometry; for he may be made to do the same with all geometry and \
every other branch of knowledge. Now, has any one ever taught him all this? \
You must know about him, if, as you say, he was born and bred in your house. \
MENO: And I am certain that no one ever did teach him. SOCRATES: And yet he \
has the knowledge? MENO: The fact, Socrates, is undeniable. SOCRATES: But if \
he did not acquire the knowledge in this life, then he must have had and \
learned it at some other time? MENO: Clearly he must. SOCRATES: Which must \
have been the time when he was not a man? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: And if there \
have been always true thoughts in him, both at the time when he was and was \
not a man, which only need to be awakened into knowledge by putting questions \
to him, his soul must have always possessed this knowledge, for he always \
either was or was not a man? MENO: Obviously. SOCRATES: And if the truth of \
all things always existed in the soul, then the soul is immortal. Wherefore \
be of good cheer, and try to recollect what you do not know, or rather what \
you do not remember. MENO: I feel, somehow, that I like what you are saying. \
SOCRATES: And I, Meno, like what I am saying. Some things I have said of \
which I am not altogether confident. But that we shall be better and braver \
and less helpless if we think that we ought to enquire, than we should have \
been if we indulged in the idle fancy that there was no knowing and no use in \
seeking to know what we do not know;--that is a theme upon which I am ready \
to fight, in word and deed, to the utmost of my power. MENO: There again, \
Socrates, your words seem to me excellent. SOCRATES: Then, as we are agreed \
that a man should enquire about that which he does not know, shall you and I \
make an effort to enquire together into the nature of virtue? MENO: By all \
means, Socrates. And yet I would much rather return to my original question, \
Whether in seeking to acquire virtue we should regard it as a thing to be \
taught, or as a gift of nature, or as coming to men in some other way? \
SOCRATES: Had I the command of you as well as of myself, Meno, I would not \
have enquired whether virtue is given by instruction or not, until we had \
first ascertained 'what it is.' But as you think only of controlling me who \
am your slave, and never of controlling yourself,--such being your notion of \
freedom, I must yield to you, for you are irresistible. And therefore I have \
now to enquire into the qualities of a thing of which I do not as yet know \
the nature. At any rate, will you condescend a little, and allow the question \
'Whether virtue is given by instruction, or in any other way,' to be argued \
upon hypothesis? As the geometrician, when he is asked whether a certain \
triangle is capable being inscribed in a certain circle (Or, whether a \
certain area is capable of being inscribed as a triangle in a certain \
circle.), will reply: 'I cannot tell you as yet; but I will offer a \
hypothesis which may assist us in forming a conclusion: If the figure be such \
that when you have produced a given side of it (Or, when you apply it to the \
given line, i.e. the diameter of the circle (autou).), the given area of the \
triangle falls short by an area corresponding to the part produced (Or, \
similar to the area so applied.), then one consequence follows, and if this \
is impossible then some other; and therefore I wish to assume a hypothesis \
before I tell you whether this triangle is capable of being inscribed in the \
circle':--that is a geometrical hypothesis. And we too, as we know not the \
nature and qualities of virtue, must ask, whether virtue is or is not taught, \
under a hypothesis: as thus, if virtue is of such a class of mental goods, \
will it be taught or not? Let the first hypothesis be that virtue is or is \
not knowledge,--in that case will it be taught or not? or, as we were just \
now saying, 'remembered'? For there is no use in disputing about the name. \
But is virtue taught or not? or rather, does not every one see that knowledge \
alone is taught? MENO: I agree. SOCRATES: Then if virtue is knowledge, virtue \
will be taught? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: Then now we have made a quick end \
of this question: if virtue is of such a nature, it will be taught; and if \
not, not? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: The next question is, whether virtue is \
knowledge or of another species? MENO: Yes, that appears to be the question \
which comes next in order. SOCRATES: Do we not say that virtue is a \
good?--This is a hypothesis which is not set aside. MENO: Certainly. \
SOCRATES: Now, if there be any sort of good which is distinct from knowledge, \
virtue may be that good; but if knowledge embraces all good, then we shall be \
right in thinking that virtue is knowledge? MENO: True. SOCRATES: And virtue \
makes us good? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: And if we are good, then we are \
profitable; for all good things are profitable? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: Then \
virtue is profitable? MENO: That is the only inference. SOCRATES: Then now \
let us see what are the things which severally profit us. Health and \
strength, and beauty and wealth--these, and the like of these, we call \
profitable? MENO: True. SOCRATES: And yet these things may also sometimes do \
us harm: would you not think so? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: And what is the guiding \
principle which makes them profitable or the reverse? Are they not profitable \
when they are rightly used, and hurtful when they are not rightly used? MENO: \
Certainly. SOCRATES: Next, let us consider the goods of the soul: they are \
temperance, justice, courage, quickness of apprehension, memory, magnanimity, \
and the like? MENO: Surely. SOCRATES: And such of these as are not knowledge, \
but of another sort, are sometimes profitable and sometimes hurtful; as, for \
example, courage wanting prudence, which is only a sort of confidence? When a \
man has no sense he is harmed by courage, but when he has sense he is \
profited? MENO: True. SOCRATES: And the same may be said of temperance and \
quickness of apprehension; whatever things are learned or done with sense are \
profitable, but when done without sense they are hurtful? MENO: Very true. \
SOCRATES: And in general, all that the soul attempts or endures, when under \
the guidance of wisdom, ends in happiness; but when she is under the guidance \
of folly, in the opposite? MENO: That appears to be true. SOCRATES: If then \
virtue is a quality of the soul, and is admitted to be profitable, it must be \
wisdom or prudence, since none of the things of the soul are either \
profitable or hurtful in themselves, but they are all made profitable or \
hurtful by the addition of wisdom or of folly; and therefore if virtue is \
profitable, virtue must be a sort of wisdom or prudence? MENO: I quite agree. \
SOCRATES: And the other goods, such as wealth and the like, of which we were \
just now saying that they are sometimes good and sometimes evil, do not they \
also become profitable or hurtful, accordingly as the soul guides and uses \
them rightly or wrongly; just as the things of the soul herself are benefited \
when under the guidance of wisdom and harmed by folly? MENO: True. SOCRATES: \
And the wise soul guides them rightly, and the foolish soul wrongly. MENO: \
Yes. SOCRATES: And is not this universally true of human nature? All other \
things hang upon the soul, and the things of the soul herself hang upon \
wisdom, if they are to be good; and so wisdom is inferred to be that which \
profits--and virtue, as we say, is profitable? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: And \
thus we arrive at the conclusion that virtue is either wholly or partly \
wisdom? MENO: I think that what you are saying, Socrates, is very true. \
SOCRATES: But if this is true, then the good are not by nature good? MENO: I \
think not. SOCRATES: If they had been, there would assuredly have been \
discerners of characters among us who would have known our future great men; \
and on their showing we should have adopted them, and when we had got them, \
we should have kept them in the citadel out of the way of harm, and set a \
stamp upon them far rather than upon a piece of gold, in order that no one \
might tamper with them; and when they grew up they would have been useful to \
the state? MENO: Yes, Socrates, that would have been the right way. SOCRATES: \
But if the good are not by nature good, are they made good by instruction? \
MENO: There appears to be no other alternative, Socrates. On the supposition \
that virtue is knowledge, there can be no doubt that virtue is taught. \
SOCRATES: Yes, indeed; but what if the supposition is erroneous? MENO: I \
certainly thought just now that we were right. SOCRATES: Yes, Meno; but a \
principle which has any soundness should stand firm not only just now, but \
always. MENO: Well; and why are you so slow of heart to believe that \
knowledge is virtue? SOCRATES: I will try and tell you why, Meno. I do not \
retract the assertion that if virtue is knowledge it may be taught; but I \
fear that I have some reason in doubting whether virtue is knowledge: for \
consider now and say whether virtue, and not only virtue but anything that is \
taught, must not have teachers and disciples? MENO: Surely. SOCRATES: And \
conversely, may not the art of which neither teachers nor disciples exist be \
assumed to be incapable of being taught? MENO: True; but do you think that \
there are no teachers of virtue? SOCRATES: I have certainly often enquired \
whether there were any, and taken great pains to find them, and have never \
succeeded; and many have assisted me in the search, and they were the persons \
whom I thought the most likely to know. Here at the moment when he is wanted \
we fortunately have sitting by us Anytus, the very person of whom we should \
make enquiry; to him then let us repair. In the first place, he is the son of \
a wealthy and wise father, Anthemion, who acquired his wealth, not by \
accident or gift, like Ismenias the Theban (who has recently made himself as \
rich as Polycrates), but by his own skill and industry, and who is a well- \
conditioned, modest man, not insolent, or overbearing, or annoying; moreover, \
this son of his has received a good education, as the Athenian people \
certainly appear to think, for they choose him to fill the highest offices. \
And these are the sort of men from whom you are likely to learn whether there \
are any teachers of virtue, and who they are. Please, Anytus, to help me and \
your friend Meno in answering our question, Who are the teachers? Consider \
the matter thus: If we wanted Meno to be a good physician, to whom should we \
send him? Should we not send him to the physicians? ANYTUS: Certainly. \
SOCRATES: Or if we wanted him to be a good cobbler, should we not send him to \
the cobblers? ANYTUS: Yes. SOCRATES: And so forth? ANYTUS: Yes. SOCRATES: Let \
me trouble you with one more question. When we say that we should be right in \
sending him to the physicians if we wanted him to be a physician, do we mean \
that we should be right in sending him to those who profess the art, rather \
than to those who do not, and to those who demand payment for teaching the \
art, and profess to teach it to any one who will come and learn? And if these \
were our reasons, should we not be right in sending him? ANYTUS: Yes. \
SOCRATES: And might not the same be said of flute-playing, and of the other \
arts? Would a man who wanted to make another a flute-player refuse to send \
him to those who profess to teach the art for money, and be plaguing other \
persons to give him instruction, who are not professed teachers and who never \
had a single disciple in that branch of knowledge which he wishes him to \
acquire--would not such conduct be the height of folly? ANYTUS: Yes, by Zeus, \
and of ignorance too. SOCRATES: Very good. And now you are in a position to \
advise with me about my friend Meno. He has been telling me, Anytus, that he \
desires to attain that kind of wisdom and virtue by which men order the state \
or the house, and honour their parents, and know when to receive and when to \
send away citizens and strangers, as a good man should. Now, to whom should \
he go in order that he may learn this virtue? Does not the previous argument \
imply clearly that we should send him to those who profess and avouch that \
they are the common teachers of all Hellas, and are ready to impart \
instruction to any one who likes, at a fixed price? ANYTUS: Whom do you mean, \
Socrates? SOCRATES: You surely know, do you not, Anytus, that these are the \
people whom mankind call Sophists? ANYTUS: By Heracles, Socrates, forbear! I \
only hope that no friend or kinsman or acquaintance of mine, whether citizen \
or stranger, will ever be so mad as to allow himself to be corrupted by them; \
for they are a manifest pest and corrupting influence to those who have to do \
with them. SOCRATES: What, Anytus? Of all the people who profess that they \
know how to do men good, do you mean to say that these are the only ones who \
not only do them no good, but positively corrupt those who are entrusted to \
them, and in return for this disservice have the face to demand money? \
Indeed, I cannot believe you; for I know of a single man, Protagoras, who \
made more out of his craft than the illustrious Pheidias, who created such \
noble works, or any ten other statuaries. How could that be? A mender of old \
shoes, or patcher up of clothes, who made the shoes or clothes worse than he \
received them, could not have remained thirty days undetected, and would very \
soon have starved; whereas during more than forty years, Protagoras was \
corrupting all Hellas, and sending his disciples from him worse than he \
received them, and he was never found out. For, if I am not mistaken, he was \
about seventy years old at his death, forty of which were spent in the \
practice of his profession; and during all that time he had a good \
reputation, which to this day he retains: and not only Protagoras, but many \
others are well spoken of; some who lived before him, and others who are \
still living. Now, when you say that they deceived and corrupted the youth, \
are they to be supposed to have corrupted them consciously or unconsciously? \
Can those who were deemed by many to be the wisest men of Hellas have been \
out of their minds? ANYTUS: Out of their minds! No, Socrates; the young men \
who gave their money to them were out of their minds, and their relations and \
guardians who entrusted their youth to the care of these men were still more \
out of their minds, and most of all, the cities who allowed them to come in, \
and did not drive them out, citizen and stranger alike. SOCRATES: Has any of \
the Sophists wronged you, Anytus? What makes you so angry with them? ANYTUS: \
No, indeed, neither I nor any of my belongings has ever had, nor would I \
suffer them to have, anything to do with them. SOCRATES: Then you are \
entirely unacquainted with them? ANYTUS: And I have no wish to be acquainted. \
SOCRATES: Then, my dear friend, how can you know whether a thing is good or \
bad of which you are wholly ignorant? ANYTUS: Quite well; I am sure that I \
know what manner of men these are, whether I am acquainted with them or not. \
SOCRATES: You must be a diviner, Anytus, for I really cannot make out, \
judging from your own words, how, if you are not acquainted with them, you \
know about them. But I am not enquiring of you who are the teachers who will \
corrupt Meno (let them be, if you please, the Sophists); I only ask you to \
tell him who there is in this great city who will teach him how to become \
eminent in the virtues which I was just now describing. He is the friend of \
your family, and you will oblige him. ANYTUS: Why do you not tell him \
yourself? SOCRATES: I have told him whom I supposed to be the teachers of \
these things; but I learn from you that I am utterly at fault, and I dare say \
that you are right. And now I wish that you, on your part, would tell me to \
whom among the Athenians he should go. Whom would you name? ANYTUS: Why \
single out individuals? Any Athenian gentleman, taken at random, if he will \
mind him, will do far more good to him than the Sophists. SOCRATES: And did \
those gentlemen grow of themselves; and without having been taught by any \
one, were they nevertheless able to teach others that which they had never \
learned themselves? ANYTUS: I imagine that they learned of the previous \
generation of gentlemen. Have there not been many good men in this city? \
SOCRATES: Yes, certainly, Anytus; and many good statesmen also there always \
have been and there are still, in the city of Athens. But the question is \
whether they were also good teachers of their own virtue;--not whether there \
are, or have been, good men in this part of the world, but whether virtue can \
be taught, is the question which we have been discussing. Now, do we mean to \
say that the good men of our own and of other times knew how to impart to \
others that virtue which they had themselves; or is virtue a thing incapable \
of being communicated or imparted by one man to another? That is the question \
which I and Meno have been arguing. Look at the matter in your own way: Would \
you not admit that Themistocles was a good man? ANYTUS: Certainly; no man \
better. SOCRATES: And must not he then have been a good teacher, if any man \
ever was a good teacher, of his own virtue? ANYTUS: Yes certainly,--if he \
wanted to be so. SOCRATES: But would he not have wanted? He would, at any \
rate, have desired to make his own son a good man and a gentleman; he could \
not have been jealous of him, or have intentionally abstained from imparting \
to him his own virtue. Did you never hear that he made his son Cleophantus a \
famous horseman; and had him taught to stand upright on horseback and hurl a \
javelin, and to do many other marvellous things; and in anything which could \
be learned from a master he was well trained? Have you not heard from our \
elders of him? ANYTUS: I have. SOCRATES: Then no one could say that his son \
showed any want of capacity? ANYTUS: Very likely not. SOCRATES: But did any \
one, old or young, ever say in your hearing that Cleophantus, son of \
Themistocles, was a wise or good man, as his father was? ANYTUS: I have \
certainly never heard any one say so. SOCRATES: And if virtue could have been \
taught, would his father Themistocles have sought to train him in these minor \
accomplishments, and allowed him who, as you must remember, was his own son, \
to be no better than his neighbours in those qualities in which he himself \
excelled? ANYTUS: Indeed, indeed, I think not. SOCRATES: Here was a teacher \
of virtue whom you admit to be among the best men of the past. Let us take \
another,--Aristides, the son of Lysimachus: would you not acknowledge that he \
was a good man? ANYTUS: To be sure I should. SOCRATES: And did not he train \
his son Lysimachus better than any other Athenian in all that could be done \
for him by the help of masters? But what has been the result? Is he a bit \
better than any other mortal? He is an acquaintance of yours, and you see \
what he is like. There is Pericles, again, magnificent in his wisdom; and he, \
as you are aware, had two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus. ANYTUS: I know. \
SOCRATES: And you know, also, that he taught them to be unrivalled horsemen, \
and had them trained in music and gymnastics and all sorts of arts--in these \
respects they were on a level with the best--and had he no wish to make good \
men of them? Nay, he must have wished it. But virtue, as I suspect, could not \
be taught. And that you may not suppose the incompetent teachers to be only \
the meaner sort of Athenians and few in number, remember again that \
Thucydides had two sons, Melesias and Stephanus, whom, besides giving them a \
good education in other things, he trained in wrestling, and they were the \
best wrestlers in Athens: one of them he committed to the care of Xanthias, \
and the other of Eudorus, who had the reputation of being the most celebrated \
wrestlers of that day. Do you remember them? ANYTUS: I have heard of them. \
SOCRATES: Now, can there be a doubt that Thucydides, whose children were \
taught things for which he had to spend money, would have taught them to be \
good men, which would have cost him nothing, if virtue could have been \
taught? Will you reply that he was a mean man, and had not many friends among \
the Athenians and allies? Nay, but he was of a great family, and a man of \
influence at Athens and in all Hellas, and, if virtue could have been taught, \
he would have found out some Athenian or foreigner who would have made good \
men of his sons, if he could not himself spare the time from cares of state. \
Once more, I suspect, friend Anytus, that virtue is not a thing which can be \
taught? ANYTUS: Socrates, I think that you are too ready to speak evil of \
men: and, if you will take my advice, I would recommend you to be careful. \
Perhaps there is no city in which it is not easier to do men harm than to do \
them good, and this is certainly the case at Athens, as I believe that you \
know. SOCRATES: O Meno, think that Anytus is in a rage. And he may well be in \
a rage, for he thinks, in the first place, that I am defaming these \
gentlemen; and in the second place, he is of opinion that he is one of them \
himself. But some day he will know what is the meaning of defamation, and if \
he ever does, he will forgive me. Meanwhile I will return to you, Meno; for I \
suppose that there are gentlemen in your region too? MENO: Certainly there \
are. SOCRATES: And are they willing to teach the young? and do they profess \
to be teachers? and do they agree that virtue is taught? MENO: No indeed, \
Socrates, they are anything but agreed; you may hear them saying at one time \
that virtue can be taught, and then again the reverse. SOCRATES: Can we call \
those teachers who do not acknowledge the possibility of their own vocation? \
MENO: I think not, Socrates. SOCRATES: And what do you think of these \
Sophists, who are the only professors? Do they seem to you to be teachers of \
virtue? MENO: I often wonder, Socrates, that Gorgias is never heard promising \
to teach virtue: and when he hears others promising he only laughs at them; \
but he thinks that men should be taught to speak. SOCRATES: Then do you not \
think that the Sophists are teachers? MENO: I cannot tell you, Socrates; like \
the rest of the world, I am in doubt, and sometimes I think that they are \
teachers and sometimes not. SOCRATES: And are you aware that not you only and \
other politicians have doubts whether virtue can be taught or not, but that \
Theognis the poet says the very same thing? MENO: Where does he say so? \
SOCRATES: In these elegiac verses (Theog.): 'Eat and drink and sit with the \
mighty, and make yourself agreeable to them; for from the good you will learn \
what is good, but if you mix with the bad you will lose the intelligence \
which you already have.' Do you observe that here he seems to imply that \
virtue can be taught? MENO: Clearly. SOCRATES: But in some other verses he \
shifts about and says (Theog.): 'If understanding could be created and put \
into a man, then they' (who were able to perform this feat) 'would have \
obtained great rewards.' And again:-- 'Never would a bad son have sprung from \
a good sire, for he would have heard the voice of instruction; but not by \
teaching will you ever make a bad man into a good one.' And this, as you may \
remark, is a contradiction of the other. MENO: Clearly. SOCRATES: And is \
there anything else of which the professors are affirmed not only not to be \
teachers of others, but to be ignorant themselves, and bad at the knowledge \
of that which they are professing to teach? or is there anything about which \
even the acknowledged 'gentlemen' are sometimes saying that 'this thing can \
be taught,' and sometimes the opposite? Can you say that they are teachers in \
any true sense whose ideas are in such confusion? MENO: I should say, \
certainly not. SOCRATES: But if neither the Sophists nor the gentlemen are \
teachers, clearly there can be no other teachers? MENO: No. SOCRATES: And if \
there are no teachers, neither are there disciples? MENO: Agreed. SOCRATES: \
And we have admitted that a thing cannot be taught of which there are neither \
teachers nor disciples? MENO: We have. SOCRATES: And there are no teachers of \
virtue to be found anywhere? MENO: There are not. SOCRATES: And if there are \
no teachers, neither are there scholars? MENO: That, I think, is true. \
SOCRATES: Then virtue cannot be taught? MENO: Not if we are right in our \
view. But I cannot believe, Socrates, that there are no good men: And if \
there are, how did they come into existence? SOCRATES: I am afraid, Meno, \
that you and I are not good for much, and that Gorgias has been as poor an \
educator of you as Prodicus has been of me. Certainly we shall have to look \
to ourselves, and try to find some one who will help in some way or other to \
improve us. This I say, because I observe that in the previous discussion \
none of us remarked that right and good action is possible to man under other \
guidance than that of knowledge (episteme);--and indeed if this be denied, \
there is no seeing how there can be any good men at all. MENO: How do you \
mean, Socrates? SOCRATES: I mean that good men are necessarily useful or \
profitable. Were we not right in admitting this? It must be so. MENO: Yes. \
SOCRATES: And in supposing that they will be useful only if they are true \
guides to us of action--there we were also right? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: But \
when we said that a man cannot be a good guide unless he have knowledge \
(phrhonesis), this we were wrong. MENO: What do you mean by the word 'right'? \
SOCRATES: I will explain. If a man knew the way to Larisa, or anywhere else, \
and went to the place and led others thither, would he not be a right and \
good guide? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: And a person who had a right opinion \
about the way, but had never been and did not know, might be a good guide \
also, might he not? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: And while he has true opinion \
about that which the other knows, he will be just as good a guide if he \
thinks the truth, as he who knows the truth? MENO: Exactly. SOCRATES: Then \
true opinion is as good a guide to correct action as knowledge; and that was \
the point which we omitted in our speculation about the nature of virtue, \
when we said that knowledge only is the guide of right action; whereas there \
is also right opinion. MENO: True. SOCRATES: Then right opinion is not less \
useful than knowledge? MENO: The difference, Socrates, is only that he who \
has knowledge will always be right; but he who has right opinion will \
sometimes be right, and sometimes not. SOCRATES: What do you mean? Can he be \
wrong who has right opinion, so long as he has right opinion? MENO: I admit \
the cogency of your argument, and therefore, Socrates, I wonder that \
knowledge should be preferred to right opinion--or why they should ever \
differ. SOCRATES: And shall I explain this wonder to you? MENO: Do tell me. \
SOCRATES: You would not wonder if you had ever observed the images of \
Daedalus (Compare Euthyphro); but perhaps you have not got them in your \
country? MENO: What have they to do with the question? SOCRATES: Because they \
require to be fastened in order to keep them, and if they are not fastened \
they will play truant and run away. MENO: Well, what of that? SOCRATES: I \
mean to say that they are not very valuable possessions if they are at \
liberty, for they will walk off like runaway slaves; but when fastened, they \
are of great value, for they are really beautiful works of art. Now this is \
an illustration of the nature of true opinions: while they abide with us they \
are beautiful and fruitful, but they run away out of the human soul, and do \
not remain long, and therefore they are not of much value until they are \
fastened by the tie of the cause; and this fastening of them, friend Meno, is \
recollection, as you and I have agreed to call it. But when they are bound, \
in the first place, they have the nature of knowledge; and, in the second \
place, they are abiding. And this is why knowledge is more honourable and \
excellent than true opinion, because fastened by a chain. MENO: What you are \
saying, Socrates, seems to be very like the truth. SOCRATES: I too speak \
rather in ignorance; I only conjecture. And yet that knowledge differs from \
true opinion is no matter of conjecture with me. There are not many things \
which I profess to know, but this is most certainly one of them. MENO: Yes, \
Socrates; and you are quite right in saying so. SOCRATES: And am I not also \
right in saying that true opinion leading the way perfects action quite as \
well as knowledge? MENO: There again, Socrates, I think you are right. \
SOCRATES: Then right opinion is not a whit inferior to knowledge, or less \
useful in action; nor is the man who has right opinion inferior to him who \
has knowledge? MENO: True. SOCRATES: And surely the good man has been \
acknowledged by us to be useful? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: Seeing then that men \
become good and useful to states, not only because they have knowledge, but \
because they have right opinion, and that neither knowledge nor right opinion \
is given to man by nature or acquired by him--(do you imagine either of them \
to be given by nature? MENO: Not I.) SOCRATES: Then if they are not given by \
nature, neither are the good by nature good? MENO: Certainly not. SOCRATES: \
And nature being excluded, then came the question whether virtue is acquired \
by teaching? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: If virtue was wisdom (or knowledge), then, \
as we thought, it was taught? MENO: Yes. SOCRATES: And if it was taught it \
was wisdom? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: And if there were teachers, it might \
be taught; and if there were no teachers, not? MENO: True. SOCRATES: But \
surely we acknowledged that there were no teachers of virtue? MENO: Yes. \
SOCRATES: Then we acknowledged that it was not taught, and was not wisdom? \
MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: And yet we admitted that it was a good? MENO: Yes. \
SOCRATES: And the right guide is useful and good? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: \
And the only right guides are knowledge and true opinion--these are the \
guides of man; for things which happen by chance are not under the guidance \
of man: but the guides of man are true opinion and knowledge. MENO: I think \
so too. SOCRATES: But if virtue is not taught, neither is virtue knowledge. \
MENO: Clearly not. SOCRATES: Then of two good and useful things, one, which \
is knowledge, has been set aside, and cannot be supposed to be our guide in \
political life. MENO: I think not. SOCRATES: And therefore not by any wisdom, \
and not because they were wise, did Themistocles and those others of whom \
Anytus spoke govern states. This was the reason why they were unable to make \
others like themselves--because their virtue was not grounded on knowledge. \
MENO: That is probably true, Socrates. SOCRATES: But if not by knowledge, the \
only alternative which remains is that statesmen must have guided states by \
right opinion, which is in politics what divination is in religion; for \
diviners and also prophets say many things truly, but they know not what they \
say. MENO: So I believe. SOCRATES: And may we not, Meno, truly call those men \
'divine' who, having no understanding, yet succeed in many a grand deed and \
word? MENO: Certainly. SOCRATES: Then we shall also be right in calling \
divine those whom we were just now speaking of as diviners and prophets, \
including the whole tribe of poets. Yes, and statesmen above all may be said \
to be divine and illumined, being inspired and possessed of God, in which \
condition they say many grand things, not knowing what they say. MENO: Yes. \
SOCRATES: And the women too, Meno, call good men divine--do they not? and the \
Spartans, when they praise a good man, say 'that he is a divine man.' MENO: \
And I think, Socrates, that they are right; although very likely our friend \
Anytus may take offence at the word. SOCRATES: I do not care; as for Anytus, \
there will be another opportunity of talking with him. To sum up our \
enquiry--the result seems to be, if we are at all right in our view, that \
virtue is neither natural nor acquired, but an instinct given by God to the \
virtuous. Nor is the instinct accompanied by reason, unless there may be \
supposed to be among statesmen some one who is capable of educating \
statesmen. And if there be such an one, he may be said to be among the living \
what Homer says that Tiresias was among the dead, 'he alone has \
understanding; but the rest are flitting shades'; and he and his virtue in \
like manner will be a reality among shadows. MENO: That is excellent, \
Socrates. SOCRATES: Then, Meno, the conclusion is that virtue comes to the \
virtuous by the gift of God. But we shall never know the certain truth until, \
before asking how virtue is given, we enquire into the actual nature of \
virtue. I fear that I must go away, but do you, now that you are persuaded \
yourself, persuade our friend Anytus. And do not let him be so exasperated; \
if you can conciliate him, you will have done good service to the Athenian \
people.  PREAMBLE Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the \
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the \
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, Whereas disregard and \
contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged \
the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings \
shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has \
been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, Whereas it is \
essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, \
to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be \
protected by the rule of law, Whereas it is essential to promote the \
development of friendly relations between nations, Whereas the peoples of the \
United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental \
human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal \
rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and \
better standards of life in larger freedom, Whereas Member States have \
pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the \
promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and \
fundamental freedoms, Whereas a common understanding of these rights and \
freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this \
pledge, Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL \

peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of \
society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by \

more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide \
for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings \
of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \
Constitution for the United States of America. Article. I. Section. 1. All \
legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United \
States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. \
Section. 2. The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen \
every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in \
each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most \
numerous Branch of the State Legislature. No Person shall be a Representative \
who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven \
Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an \
Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. Representatives and \
direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be \
included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which \
shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including \
those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, \
three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made \
within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United \
States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they \
shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for \
every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; \
and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be \
entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence \
Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, \
Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina \
five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three. When vacancies happen in the \
Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue \
Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies. The House of Representatives shall \
chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of \
Impeachment. Section. 3. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of \
two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof for six \
Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote. Immediately after they shall be \
assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as \
equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first \
Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second \
Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the \
Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second \
Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess \
of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary \
Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill \
such Vacancies. No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to \
the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, \
and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he \
shall be chosen. The Vice President of the United States shall be President \
of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided. The \
Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in \
the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of \
President of the United States. The Senate shall have the sole Power to try \
all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or \
Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief \
Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the \
Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. Judgment in Cases of \
Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and \
disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under \
the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and \
subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. \
Section. 4. The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators \
and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature \
thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such \
Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. The Congress shall \
assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first \
Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day. \
Section. 5. Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and \
Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a \
Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and \
may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, \
and under such Penalties as each House may provide. Each House may determine \
the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, \
and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member. Each House shall \
keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, \
excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas \
and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire \
of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal. Neither House, \
during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, \
adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which \
the two Houses shall be sitting. Section. 6. The Senators and Representatives \
shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, \
and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, \
except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest \
during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in \
going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either \
House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place. No Senator or \
Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed \
to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall \
have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during \
such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be \
a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office. Section. 7. All \
Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; \
but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills. Every \
Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, \
shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United \
States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with \
his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall \
enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. \
If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass \
the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, \
by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of \
that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both \
Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons \
voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House \
respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten \
Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same \
shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by \
their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law. \
Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and \
House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of \
Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and \
before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being \
disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House \
of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the \
Case of a Bill. Section. 8. The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect \
Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the \
common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, \
Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; To borrow \
Money on the credit of the United States; To regulate Commerce with foreign \
Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; To \
establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject \
of Bankruptcies throughout the United States; To coin Money, regulate the \
Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and \
Measures; To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and \
current Coin of the United States; To establish Post Offices and post Roads; \
To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited \
Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective \
Writings and Discoveries; To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme \
Court; To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, \
and Offences against the Law of Nations; To declare War, grant Letters of \
Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water; To \
raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be \
for a longer Term than two Years; To provide and maintain a Navy; To make \
Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces; To \
provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, \
suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, \
arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as \
may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States \

which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more \
than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed \
by the States, but they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election \
of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State; and \
they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the \
twelfth article of amendment. Section 2. The Congress shall have power to \
enforce this article by appropriate legislation. AMENDMENT XXIV Passed by \
Congress August 27, 1962. Ratified January 23, 1964. Section 1. The right of \
citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for \
President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or \
for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by \
the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay poll tax or other \
tax. Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by \
appropriate legislation. AMENDMENT XXV Passed by Congress July 6, 1965. \
Ratified February 10, 1967. Section 1. In case of the removal of the \
President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President \
shall become President. Section 2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office \
of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who \
shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of \
Congress. Section 3. Whenever the President transmits to the President pro \
tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his \
written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of \
his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the \
contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as \
Acting President. Section 4. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of \
either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other \
body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of \
the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written \
declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties \
of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and \
duties of the office as Acting President. Thereafter, when the President \
transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the \
House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he \
shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President \
and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department \
or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four \
days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House \
of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to \
discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall \
decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not \
in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the \
latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within \
twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by \
two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the \
powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to \
discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume \
the powers and duties of his office. AMENDMENT XXVI Passed by Congress March \
23, 1971. Ratified July 1, 1971. Section 1. The right of citizens of the \
United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be \
denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age. \
Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by \
appropriate legislation. AMENDMENT XXVII Originally proposed Sept. 25, 1789. \
Ratified May 7, 1992. No law, varying the compensation for the services of \
the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of \
representatives shall have intervened.", {
