Most of my contributions have been in developing the algorithm that we use to \
gather and sort through the massive amounts of data available to us. I have \
worked on extracting useful information from the data that comes from social \
media accounts, generating valid id numbers and attempting to work around \
various problems that arise such as, but not limited to: incomplete profiles, \
Facebook\[CloseCurlyQuote]s daily limited query amount, and properly \
formatting imported and exported files for storing and retrieving large \
amounts of information. Now, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m working on bringing all of \
those functions together into one large function that can be ran from Logan\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s GUI. Logan and I have also been going to meetings with \
Dr. Hahn to discuss what to do with the data we have.
